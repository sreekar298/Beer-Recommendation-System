Prior 8,4.5,"Had this on draft 9/8/22 @ the Hopleaf.

Mostly opaque brown appearance.

Nice tan head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace.

Cream, raisin & leather notes in the nose.

Creamy, medium thick mouthfeel.

Cream, dry raisin & leather flavors; booze heat emerged as this warmed.

Just a fantastic, world-class beer. No big deal."
Prior 8,4.46,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottle purchased on 8/22/22.

L- Deep scarlet hazy color.

S- Rich malty deep pumpernickel nose.

T- Very nice malty flavor with pronounced
Belgian yeasty spice.

F- Fine carbonation with a little bite.

O- Fantastic Belgian taste! Really damn
good!"
Prior 8,2.45,"Look: Nice color, brown with a nice head

Smell: Smells weird, everyone has been hyping it up to smell like chocolate, I think it smells like peanuts, weird

Taste: Bad. Why is it sour?

Feel: Fine considering how sour it is

I was thoroughly disappointed by this. Considering triple was phenomenal"
Prior 8,4.01,"Had a 750mL leftover from St Bernardus day. Best by some time in early 2025

On the pour a bit of a disappointing fizzy head formed, just about a finger of light brown bubbles that quickly recedes to a thick ring around the rim and a quite effervescent covering. Body is a dark hazy brown that barely lets any light through. Second glass had a much nicer mor traditional looking head that tried to lace, my glass may have been dirty.

Aroma is quite belgian amd dark woth strong plummy and figgy notes followed by a light roast malt. Almost all fermentation aroma, but it is a nice dark belgian smell.

Taste is much more nuanced than the aroma with roasty malts coming through quite nicely after a quick but prominent hit of belgian yeast and some light hop bitterness. The taste is surprisingly smooth and chocolatey. Like a fruity less bitter dark chocolate. The figgy notes stay present woth only a little fresh plum on the taste. Not as bright and tart as the aroma would suggest.

Feel is not as big as expected. Very dry amd carbonated with a decently long finish. There is some warming in the chest from the alcohol, but this is quite drinkable and a good example of a belgian dubbed.

Overall I enjoyed this beer. Makes me want to revisit Abt 12 just to see what I can pick up on now. A very nice dark beer with some good belgian character, and a very nice soft malt bill."
Prior 8,4.35,"Poured into a snifter a medium brown with a tall manilla colored head that was very tall.
The aroma was sweet malts, but not sugar sweet, more dark chocolate sweet.
The taste was excellent, so good, dark fruit, dark molasses, mild malts and yeast for a mild grassy touch.
The feel was very good, just very smooth and drinkable.
OA, darn tasty dubbel, will gladly drink again."
Prior 8,5,Outstanding.
Prior 8,4.35,"I have to have a dubbel when I'm eating asian food. When I can't get Ommegang Abbey Ale, I suffer with Prior 8. Well, I don't exactly suffer, Prior 8 is a wonderful beer. Goes great with chow mei fun."
Prior 8,4.5,"On tap at the Map Room in Chicago, IL.

This one pours a dark golden brown color, with a small foamy white head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like dark fruit, toasted spice, clove, fermented molasses, brown sugar, and tea.

It should be a surprise to no one that this one's a little stunner. It's especially cool to find this on draft. It's got a super creamy and malty goodness to it, with some like toasted nutmeg flavors, some nuttiness, brown sugar, and a tea-like bitterness. There's also some breadiness with just a hint of caramel. There's also just a hint of classic Belgian yeastiness.

This is medium bodied, creamy, with a great smooth drinkability and finish.

This is a classic, and for good reason."
Prior 8,4.06,"Bought at Liquor Shed in Casper as part of a mixed 12pack. Best before July 4th 2025.

It pours a reddish brown with a good head of tannish foam. Lacing is great.

Smells malty, yeasty, Belgian spice, dark fruits.

Taste is dark pitted fruits, malty in a non sweet way, spicy...being bottled in 2020, I reckon that it does lack some vibrancy. Still, quite good.

Medium bodied, lively carbonation.

This held up way better than the Pater 6, which was bottled 2 years earlier."
Prior 8,4.15,"finally get to try prior 8, pater 6 is a real favourite of mine, probably my favourite beer in the style, this is up there as well, lovely dark malt flavours, almost meaty, lots of chocolate, black bread, dark fruits, fig and raisin, some honeycomb, nicely sweet, little bit of belgian spice, light to medium bitterness on the finish, medium bodied with high levels of carbonation, little bit of dryness to it, really quite pleasant, a great beer from a great brewery"
Prior 8,3.92,"Pours a brownish copper color with over a finger of head. The nose has that distinct note of Belgian yeast but it is not very pungent. The flavor profile has notes of bread, dark fruits and spice. The finish is slightly dry in the most mild sense of the term."
Prior 8,4.6,"pours a deep semi-murky cola brown with tanned frothy foam head that billows and holds rocky with very high retention, slowly revealing thick streaks and sheets of lacing as it settles to a murky island cap with thick halo

aroma is sweet, candied, and dark. molasses with dark fruit and a little citrus laced with spice

taste is a cracker jack spark of the aroma; sweet and candied molasses forward chocolate orange and spiced plum. rich, robust, spiced just enough to flare a contrast in the dark sweetness with the citrus.

body is high carbonation with medium-light body. runs chewy with light outer limits, and a combined effort towards a somewhat creamy feel (if not slightly foamy feeling) before finishing semi-dry with a bubblegum and molasses thick bittering hop resin laced with sweet citrus and belgian spice in the aftertaste

overall:
whoas. superb. a total notch above the Pater in sparked intensity and flavor. more lively, with a citrus tinge and plenty of belgian spice and bubblegum in the candied sweetness. somehow feels super balanced while entertaining a big complexity. the citrus was a nice turn, and the overall candied feeling gets balanced in a wonderful way with the robust malt and bittering elements. out of the dubbels I've had, this one feels the most unique so far."
Prior 8,4.41,"11.2oz bottle

Dark brown/amber, very sweet candied sugar scent. The taste has hints of cocoa powder and coffee beans alongside a mild belgian dark ale and the candied dark fruit you'd expect. Kinda tastes like coca-cola or more accurately, pepsi cola. Floral and citrus hop flavors alongside the caramel malt, plums, maple syrup, a slight medicinal bitterness...all the flavors meld together into a savory aromatic dark creamy fruity blend. Winner."
Prior 8,4.47,"Poured into snifter. Dark opaque brown with a big light khaki head.

Dark fruit nose, especially plum, A note of citrus sweet.

Taste follows with dark chocolate and malt. A boozy tail.

Crazy smooth.

Very smooth and creamy dubbel. Not easy to forget"
Prior 8,4,Looks very dark with a light brown foam head. Smells very deep with malts. Taste strong with malt and coffee. Overall its a nice beer.
Prior 8,4.14,"I bought a mixed pack at the LCBO in Ontario 6 bottles 330ml .
Every Christmas time I see these Belgium beers come in .
Prior 8 330ml bottle at 8%.
Dark color almost looks like a coca Cola poured a 2finger head leaving a lace as you drink it.
Looks like an expiration date on my bottle 04/06/25 wow good for 4years .
Smooth and creamy just sipping on it at 8% strong .
Very pleasant beer to drink . Sweet dark fruits dark chocolate or roasted Caramel but well balanced and smooth.
alcohol is hidden at times when drinking it .
I find that amazing in these Belgium beers .
Overall pleasant and very enjoyable to drink.
I love most of these Belgium beers look forward to them every Christmas time
Cheers ."
Prior 8,4.58,"Appearance: Saddle brown, thick frothy tan head with great retention.

Aroma: Dark malt aromas, dark fruit, grainy. Alcohol not noticeable.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Slightly warming from alcohol presence. Restrained bitterness.

Mouth-feel: Medium bodied. Effervescent & vibrant.

Overall: Another well crafted, Belgian Double. Mild fruity esters and malt aromas and flavors."
Prior 8,3.5,De color marrón con una buena espuma de retención media. Cuerpo medio y baja carbonatación. Aroma a malta tostada y frutos secos. En boca tiene un equilibrio entre amargor y dulzor.
Golden Monkey,3.88,"From the bottom of the can: ""BEST BY JUL 13 24 PBG 22194 14:38 FL""

Appearance: The body is a pretty medium shade of gold. It has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. The head is massive, creamy textured, and slightly off-white with a bit of an eggshell appearance. It has very good head retention and very nice sheets of creamy lacing on the glass.

Aroma: There is a bit of a banana aroma to the beer with a touch of an old paper scent. After the glass is agitated a bit there is a hint of a white pepper character that comes through.

Taste: Up front there is banana and a light bit of coriander. Towards the middle of the mouth there is a very light touch of clove mixed with more of that banana flavor. It has a very mellow sweetness that is balanced well with the beer. The flavor doesn't transform to the back of the mouth or in the aftertaste and stays mostly banana with a light hint of clove at times.

Mouthfeel: It is very smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation feels a little on the light side but the body of the beer still feels great. It has very high drinkability and it hides the alcohol well.

Overall: It is a really well made beer. The can states that this has a ""Belgian yeast character of banana and clove"" and they really hit the nail on the head with that description. The beer has a pleasant banana flavor with just a light touch of perceived sweetness that feels balanced. It is enjoyable to drink. I would recommend it and I would buy it again."
Golden Monkey,4.1,"Surprisingly good American take on a Tripel. Purchased a six pack of 12oz bottles and sampling in a tulip glass.

Allowed bottle to warm to 50F before pouring. Little to no head and very little lacing. On the nose, I am getting faint bananas and cloves with a background note of caramel. Taste is actually very yeast and malt forward, with a higher-than-usual sweetness and a clean lighter hop finish (Tettnang, maybe?). Subdued, but present, alcohol taste, which is not out of place for the style. Some black pepper notes on the tongue, which is present in my favorite Belgians.

It is the mouthfeel that throws it off, for me. For the style, it feels much thinner than I expected. If it was not so thin, I think that it would drink a little slower. Somehow, this is an almost crushable tripel, which is just as dangerous as it sounds. Allowing this to sit in the glass and warm up a bit, it becomes more balanced, and I get some slightly floral notes and a slightly improved mouthfeel.

Honestly, for the price, it exceeded expectations. I would have no problem buying it again, although I would not say it is the best in the style. However, it might be my favorite of American tripels, so far."
Golden Monkey,3.57,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A 1"" off white head drops slowly, no lacing. Color is golden amber. Aroma of banana, clove and other spices. Mouthfeel is medium with dry finish. Flavor bursts with clove, allspice, earthy hops, yeast rolls. Overall: lots of flavor but not necessarily a situation of more=better. It's very good but not excellent. I probably would not buy this particular tripel again for that reason."
Golden Monkey,4.05,"October 9th, 2016 - A classic, but well worth reviewing again. Those Belgian esters hit softly but with definition, coaxing the olfactory with pear, banana (peel) and clove, with a richness that is intoxicating. The flavor is even better, translating those esters into a chorus of fruit flavors, and some nice spicy garnishes. I find pear, cinnamon and custard, with a little pepper for an unexpected kick. There's a reason this has been around for so long. Here's to hoping it's around in another decade."
Golden Monkey,4.4,"Tried this beer on a recommendation from a friend who originally sent me some Victory Beer in a beer box. To me, it tastes great and the ABV is in the mid-upper range that I like to start with.
Definitely One of my favorites."
Golden Monkey,3.74,"Fairly light head. Smell is sweet; banana and bubblegum, esters, coriander, cloves. Taste follows; sweet slightly caramel malt, banana, a hint of orange peel and citrus hops, becoming bubblegum and fruit esters, finishing with plenty of cloves and coriander. The alcohol is quite present; finish is dry. Not bad, but a bit too sweet and too reliant on the presence of spices for me."
Golden Monkey,3.65,"clear yellow with a short & short lived head with a faint aroma of banana, clove, and candied orange peel

Monkey tastes of banana, clove, candied orange peel, pear juice, with a peppery hit at the end.

almost no carbonation in the glass, but has a fizzy mouthful with a dry peppery, slightly bitter finish

not a bad tripel for the price"
Golden Monkey,4.52,"Originally when I had my first Golden Monkey it was in a Victory mix pack. That mix pack had hop devil, prima pils, another victory beer I can't remember and golden monkey. I remember dreading having to drink Golden Monkey and would often split it with someone rather than waste it. The bottom line, I was out of touch with the world of Belgian style beers. Long story short, over time, Golden Monkey ascended to one of my favorite styles. This is a clean, spicy, and dry finish beer that leaves you with a warm happiness."
Golden Monkey,3.9,Solid brew from victory
Golden Monkey,3.85,"Best by 5/17/23

Oh man, how the hell have I never reviewed this one? This was a big one that pulled me into craft before my legal drinking days. I would also wager that it was my first Belgian-esque beer, but I can’t say for sure. Enough talk, rime for a proper review of this classic

Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

There’s not a whole lot going on in the nose, just a nice balance of spice and fruit. I’m picking up on aromas of clove, overripe banana, white pepper, orange rind, and bready malt

There’s a bit more going on in taste, and it’s a bit sweeter than the aroma especially on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, white pepper, grassy hops, crackery malt, banana, and light coriander. The swallow brings notes of candi sugar, toffee, clove, overripe banana, bready malt, apple skin, and orange rind

A medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer with a bit of bite. Finishes neutral but a bit too sweet

This is a good beer, but after years it pales in comparison to other Tripels and Belgian beers in general. Still, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one"
Golden Monkey,4.17,"Canned 5/5/21 - ""best by 5/5/23""; drank 12/7/21 @ the Yarchives.

See-through (slightly cloudy) dull orange/yellow appearance.

Banana, clove & faint allspice notes in the nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel, with a mild cinnamon bite on the lips.

Caramel, apple cider & clove flavors up front; faint cinnamon notes on the finish.

Great holiday beer; sweet, mildly spiced and flavorful. I'm a fan!"
Golden Monkey,4,"Pours a translucent golden color with a foamy head that ends as a lot of lacing.

Smells and tastes of bread, yeast , banana and clove spice with a slightly dank twist. The finish is slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.

Medium body with light carbonation. Lush mouthfeel with a clean dry finish.

This is an Americanized take on a European standard with a bit heavier body and darker danker hop taste."
Old Viscosity,4.3,"i got vaccinated today, figured i may as well have a brew, picked a nice one too, beer is black as night, tan coloured head which quickly dissipates, lovely aroma on this, deep rich malt, dark chocolate, tobacco, vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, flavours much the same, nice balance between dark malt flavours, sweet milk chocolate and vanilla, and bitter espresso, oaky, lightly nutty, high levels of bitterness on the finish, smokey malt flavours and sweet caramel flavours linger, full bodied and light carbonation, heavy, really quite boozy, lot of warming, all in all very nice stuff, just the beer i wanted really, proper nice imperial stout"
Old Viscosity,4.1,"A - Pitch black pour with light caramel head floating on top and dense lacing.

S - Deep chocolate roast, char, and light smoke.

T - Chocolate roast and chocolate char from start to finish. Ends with a nice lingering chocolate roast bitterness.

M - Thick and velvety with a tad bit of thin around the edges, dry on the back of the tongue with a slight chalky residue coating the mouth.

O - An easy drinking Imperial Stout where the alcohol pokes through somewhat at the beginning but quickly subsides."
Old Viscosity,3.75,"Bottle. I think it’s a 2015, but the date is smudged.

Tan head. Lace. Black color.

Roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, coffee, caramel. Not super thick, but it’s a big stout. Lots of oak. Lots of bitterness from the chocolate and hops."
Old Viscosity,4.32,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Black colour (dark ruby when held to the light), huge tan head. Lovely aroma of moderately roasted malts, mild coffee, chocolate, oak and leather. Full and rich flavour, malty predominance with much the same elements as the aroma, moderate but sufficient hops in the finish. Well balanced, immensely pleasant to drink. Warming mouthfeel, but the alcohol is otherwise well hidden in the flavour."
Old Viscosity,4.44,"this is one of the beers that started my cellar, maybe not the very first bottle, but near it, and not because i adored it and wanted to see how it aged, indeed i had never even had it before, but because i was loving port at the time and never had the occasion to break it out over the years, that or i forgot, and its been collecting dust ever since. ive been doing one random cellar dark beer every thursday during quarantine for my own entertainment, and i feel thankful to have pulled this one yesterday. i cant find a date on the bottle, but this has to be approaching ten years old, its no newer than maybe seven years, i do not totally recall its origin story, lots has happened since then, but suffice it to say it should be called ancient viscosity! i dont always love how stouts age, they often taste oxidized and thin to me, especially ones that spent time in oak, sometimes its just better to drink them close to fresh, but i was rewarded for my patience with this one, that is certain, and the quality and refinement overall here is additional testament to how amazing port is with quality and attention to detail, its immaculate. close to jet black with a surprisingly high head, mocha colored and frothy, with great retention and even some lace, unexpected in a beer this old, and some obvious bottle conditioning has taken place, this is velvet to drink. i get notes of dark chocolate, black licorice, and unlit cigar in the nose and taste here, with subtle bready yeast character, earthy spice, wet hearty oak, and rich molasses. just a bit of oxidation to the nose, but absent from the flavor, shocking for how old this is. there is a nice decadence to this with it being quite dry for the style, but i do get an almost belgian dark candy sugar taste in here, all very well grounded and balanced, nice roast, smooth as anything, and really seemingly pretty bulletproof in the cellar, like even after about a decade, its still nowhere near the end of its delicious trajectory, i almost cant believe it. i love older viscosity too, but this is darn near just as good, especially with all this age on it, a stunning specimen!"
Old Viscosity,4.25,"Bitter and creamy. Chocolate and coffee. Roasty and a touch of vanilla. These are some of the qualities that make good stouts, and these are all qualities for this one. Very good, what a stout should be, but not quite at the level of Fremont Dark Star to hold my interest over the long haul."
Old Viscosity,4.18,"Black and opaque body; thick, dense, and creamy light tan head. Huge roasted and charred grain aroma; suggestions of dark chocolate. Big cocoa and roasted grain flavor; chocolate sweetness offset with medium-strength hop bitterness. Heavy body; thick and velvety; some grain husk astringency; fine blend of chocolate sweetness and dark grain and alcohol dryness.

This beer exudes stout goodness at all levels. It is very rich and satisfying with a robust character and complex and well-balanced depth. Awesome...coats the palate with thick and satisfying goodness throughout the tasting experience."
Old Viscosity,4.04,"Can into pint glass. Pours a very dark brown with a coarse light tan head. Initial impression is thick milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, and oak. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy-smooth; carbonation is just enough to showcase the flavors. Alcohol is well hidden. Finish is more coffee, dark chocolate, oak and a slight lingering bitterness. This would not be something that you would open more than one of, but the one you open will prove thoroughly enjoyable."
Old Viscosity,4.45,"A: Black with nice tan foamy head and abundant lacing that remain thru entire beer.
N: Lots of coffee, dark chocolate, malt, barley and minor vanilla.
T: Follows the nose, thick creamy coffee goodness with dark chocolate bitterness, some light malt and vanilla.
M: Thick, creamy and easy to drink.
O: Loved it, very drinkable, loads of flavor, and very well balanced."
Old Viscosity,3.47,"Of course, for old times sake I had to try the newly released 19.2 can. But back in the day this was questionable quality at $6 per bomber. Not much has changed except it's more expensive now.

Looks ok. Smells and taste big chocolate, roasted, hoppy, full flavored beer I question the categorization now of Imperial Stout as this used to be Strong Ale, wasn't it? My issue with this beer and it has always been that it becomes increasingly annoying as you go. Would be much better marketed in 12 oz 4 paks at a reasonable price.

Bottom line, one and done. Port Brewing needs to step up their game, and this used to be one of my favorite breweries."
Old Viscosity,4.27,"Beautifully carbonated blend of fresh and barrel aged black ale that nicely coats the glass.
The subtly sweet vanilla almond scent of the barrel melds with the initial taste of dried figs to balance out a drying finish of oak, cacao, and bitter hops.
Ive had it fresh and a couple years old, excellent staying power... the beer jumps off the line a bright barleywine-ish dark ale and matures into a smooth Imperial Stout with some time - Win/win.
CAUTION to those that disparage cellaring, welcome to your gateway beer."
Old Viscosity,4.53,"Call me Stupid for not having bought a few cases of Old Viscosity. Port Brewing does just about all their ales right, but Ol' Vis was incredible. Bring it back, boys/girls!!"
Abt 12,5,This beer still blows my mind. It's wholesome and delicious and everyone that I've showed it to ended up loving it as much as me. It's better than Chimay and Duvel which are also great Belgian ales. I imagine that Belgium saves it's best brews for themselves and send us the bottom of the barrel of their good beers so to say which I'm not complaining about.
Abt 12,4.75,"Dark brown with a nice foamy head.
Smells very sweet, mostly raisins / figs.
Flavors follow the nose.
Dry & sweet, very strong, and slightly bitter aftertaste."
Abt 12,4.65,"Purchased from Wegmans in Collegeville, PA on 8/23/22. Poured from bottle into a tulip glass.

L- Hazy almost plum color with a frothy
3 finger head!

S- That “Belgian “ hop nose right up front!

T- Belgian yeasty forward flavor that
gives way to an almost cognac-
like flavor. Deep and rich but also
a little sweet!

F- Prickly carbonation at first but a lush
fruity mouthfeel.

O- A world class Trappist!"
Abt 12,3.77,"Look: Dark brown. Very nice head, excellent look.

Smell: Weird to me, earthy and metal.

Taste: Sipping it’s terrible, but similar to Guinness, if you gulp it it becomes very very good

Feel: Very nice, not chewy or stick at all, very nice after taste."
Abt 12,3.52,"resembles an imitation of Sint Sixtus Westvleteren 12 but it is thinner in taste show a taste still good; effervescent phenols, full dark malts with a bitter green hop, caramel sugars in the aftertaste, tart fruit tones"
Abt 12,4.6,"Beautiful foamy pour at 53° from the 11 ounce bottle, into a Weihenstephaner Braupakt chalice, on Saint Bernardus Day, 2022.
Dated to drink by 3/10/2025.
I’m a drink it right now!
Smell is simply luxury - sweet and inviting, warm Holiday spices, sourdough bread, dark fruit.
Taste follows, with a great alcohol kick.
Feel is a mouthful. The carbonation expands all the aromas and makes you sit and chew awhile. Righteous stuff.
Overall, fresh, fulfilling, rich, nice in the head.,. one of the finest beers in the World."
Abt 12,5,"One of the best available offerings of this style.
Delicious!
The perfect digestif or special occasion brew.
Top notch stuff."
Abt 12,4.33,"Love the smell of this ale - dark fruit & bread. Taste matches smell; dark fruit & bread with a slight sour yeast flavor. A well done beer, but not a personal favorite because of the taste."
Abt 12,4.85,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass
Look: Dark brown with 1.5 fingers of head with excellent retention
Smell: Complex array of sugar and fruits
Taste: Follows the nose, with a tasty arrangement of caramel/sugary tones plus fruit. The high alcohol content is barely noticed.
Feel: Full-bodied, silky smooth going down with moderate degree of carbonation.
Overall: An incredible beer perfect for a special occasion."
Abt 12,4.6,"BBE 6/8/25. 33cl bottle to wine glass.

Look: Pours a dark, murky brown with a lightly brownish/beige fluffy head that lasts quite long and leaves just a bit of lacing.

Smell: Brown sugar and caramel. Sweet, malty and slightly alcoholic. Even a bit fruity.

Taste: Malty and sweet. Some roasty notes, some bitterness. Caramelized, almost burnt brown sugar. Dried plum and red apple.

Feel: Full mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation.

Overall: Prime example of the style. Very complex. Not too alcoholic despite its high ABV. Should be drank at the recommended temperature since it unfolds its full potential as it warms. Fantastic beer."
Abt 12,4.32,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a deep mahogany/brown color with about three fingers worth of fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of chunky lacing.

Aroma pleasant, but a bit less robust than I expected. Bready with notes of raisins, plums, dates and a faint yeastiness that rounds out the beer.

Taste follows the nose closely, dark/brown bread, dark fruits, a mild spiciness, and a mild banana-esque yeast flavor. Medium bodied, slick on the tongue, and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is quite a pleasant beer that I look forward to revisiting."
Abt 12,4.57,Yah this one’s legit. Was happy to find at Rock&Brews Orlando. Smooth and trippel notes but so much more. Lovely feel. Very balanced without being too malty or too hoppy.
Abt 12,4.24,"Poured from a 75cL corked bottle into the biggest glass I have, a spieglau American wheat beer glass and It barely fit. A dark murky brown red letting almost no light through. On the pour I got a 2 finger head that started overflowing. After a little while it disappeared to nothing. Not all that carbonated looking.

Smell is very yeast forward with fruit notes and some malts coming through. Very similar to a dry wine with grainy notes very heavy smell. Some alcohol.

Flavor is quite similar to the nose but malts are much more present. Still some acidity and fruit notes mixing with the roast to make it a bit winey. Very dark and fruity beer at the same time. Some alcohol is detected but it seems to compliment the beer at warmer Temps (20 minutes out the fridge). Very nuanced beer.

Feel is a bit thinner than I would've expected. I thought it would be thicker from all the grain that went into it. But its still very nice and almost easy to put down if it wasn't so extremely flavorful.

Overall, its a very interesting beer with lots of flavors to explore. This beer is pretty extreme to the point of giving me winey vibes, but still at its core it is beer. This is my first experience with a real belgian ale other than an old bottle of duvel a long time ago so I don't know all that much about the style. However I enjoyed this beer"
Abt 12,4.18,"Some fluffy, beaten egg white foam forms over a deep copper, almost brown body. There's some sediment floating about, but not as much as anticipated considering I can't remember how long ago I purchased this bottle. Been meaning to pop the cork for awhile now. Smells super bready and yeasty, but not in the way you generally find typical of Belgians. This is its own thing, at least to my nostrils. Lots of sweet, dark fruit; figs and such. Also some fruity notes you wouldn't necessarily expect with raspberries standing out to me. Smells fookin' great. Tastes it as well. Not as good as implied by the nose, but very tasty all the same. Yeasty up front with a fruity middle and a bready finish. Nowhere near as boozy as I'd assumed with something of this octane. Low carbonation suits this beer very well. Complex yet easy drinking beer = big thumbs up from me."
Abt 12,4.68,"L - Poured from. 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 60 degrees. One finger tan frothy head. Dark opaque brown color. Frothy lacing just stays on the glass walls

S - dark fruits like cherry, raisins, etc. and sweet bread malt scents.

T - taste follows scent with sweet bread and dark fruits. Some alcohol comes through at 10% ABV, but it’s more balanced and easy to drink than you would expect. The lightest of a floral hop bitterness in the taste. A little smoky/toasty cola comes through on some tastes as it warms up. Agitating it half way through brings back the sweet flavors. The complexity is great.

F - frothy and great thick mouthfeel. Solid carbonation.

O - This is a great beer. Obviously at 10% ABV this is a one drink and done. But the scent and flavors are excellent. Nice complexity with each taste and smell. I really enjoyed the fact that agitating/swirling partway through brought back the initial flavor and scent profiles. All in all, even at the higher ABV, I drank this one pretty fast as I kept going back for different tastes. Highly recommended as I add this to my annual rotation."
Abt 12,4.33,"Pours a deep ruby, two inch off tan head that fades after two minutes

Rum soaked deserts, malt, bread, raisin on the nose.

The look is strong, aromas fairly decent, but the drink is where the beer is, as described, formidable. Tastes of sugared bread, dried fruits such as raisins and even dried candied melon and cherry. Powerful malt backbone that lasts for days

General alcohol warmth to the sip. Assertive mouthfeel with good carbonation. My beer hid the bitterness quite well, with the sweet malt notes winning every time. Might be due to this bottle being a little older (likely).

As it warms the beer opens up quite a bit. The malty, bready notes are even more prominent if that’s even possible. Once again that rum raisin alcohol warmness presents itself. What is harder to describe is the melding of multiple flavours and tastes that’s hard for me to pick out. I’d love to come back to this beer eventually.

Complex, and even more so as it warms. One of those beers that deserves a revisit every year. I wish I could give this a better review; I chose this beer as its strong as we just receive news Russia has invaded Ukraine. A beer, a moment in time, I don’t think I’ll ever forget and will likely become a home for me and my memories in the future."
Abt 12,4.53,"Beautiful look and scent to this classic. Big tan head, wonderful lacing.

Taste of biscuits and prunes. Quite sweet, although that tapers as it warms. Heavy, with some alcohol warming. Big mouthfeel, malt that lingers for days. Excellent balance for such robust flavors.

Formidable brew"
Abt 12,4.13,"Overall: a triumphant beer that definitely stands out when you want a heavy beer but not a stout. It reminds me of old/stock ales but with less hops and bitterness. Tastes of raisin, rum, bread, and a slight pucker from prunes.

Great right ahead or right after the coldes of months, or when you need something to sip all night and a stout would be too much.

I do think there may be better quads, but as of yet I haven't found one that tops Abt 12.

Look: a dark mahogany brown that looks almost deep purple if not under light. Beautiful lacing with the a thick head that dissipates into a nice creamy top coating of bubbles.

Smell:right up in your nose, this one carries a pervasive aroma though it's not heavy. I catch the smell of Belgian yeast (sharp/sour) and it's lovely.

Taste: don't tackle this one when it's too cold, I enjoyed it after 40+ mins out of the fridge. Bold flavors that are balanced between raisins, prunes, rum, and dark bread. Loved that I can't taste any rock sugar, a common issue with me and high ABV Belgian beers.

Feel: top of the mouth silkiness and a long lasting presence on the top of the mouth/cheeks."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.5,"Pours a frothy foamy 1 finger off-white head with great retention, soapy lacing, semi hazy tons of sediment ruby to dark-amber color

Nose is quite nice, big Belgian reddish toasted malt, biscuity, nutty, caramel, toffee, dark Belgian candi sugar, malt-derived fruit esters with some fig, date, a bit of raisin, plum, light spicy floral phenols with perfumey alcohol,

Taste brings lots more typical Belgian quad, big sweet candy malt, biscuity, nutty toffee, caramel, sweet-bread crust, light perfumey alcohol and floral spicy phenols, loads of dark fruits, lots of fig date raisin like, a touch of cherry, a hint of bitterness, candy notes, finishes a touch dry, lingering cherry and other fruits,

Mouth is med to fuller bod, med to higher small bubble frothy carb, light warming alcohol

Overall very nice, standard example of a quad"
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.21,"A: Pours a deep mahogany color with 2 fingers of head that sticks around for a long while and leaves good lacing

S: Lots of dark fruit and spice from the yeast phenols along with some light caramel and brown bread

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a wave of fruity spice and yeasty phenolics, followed by some bready malt and a very light nutty undertone. Finishes with the lingering spice and dark fruit

M: Medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation

O: A nice quad that makes for a great sipper. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Good phenolic/yeast profile. Worth checking out"
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.5,"Appearance: Light brown head, about two fingers. Large bubbles. See through, reddish brown body. Moderate head retention. Sediments show up only after serving its second half, and only slightly affect its transparency.

Aroma: I’ll attempt to name its components in the order that they show up: Breadiness, alcohol, raisins, light red fruits.

Taste: First, thick, lingering and aggressive sweetness, followed by bready, boozy bitterness and alcohol with some light, fermented bananas. Perfect amount of carbonation. The sweetness quickly bounces back, joined by raisins, dark fuits. Invites you to keep drinking. The taste of alcohol is mild in comparison to its volume.

Veredict: Amazing beer. Complex, but its thick sweetness makes it incredibly easy to drink. Easy to find, and can be served cold while retaining most of its flavor profile. Probably not as fruit heavy as the Belgian counterparts, and definitely not as funky either, also lacking in spiciness. Similar to drinking Coke, though infinitely heavier and doesn’t rely on carbonation and sheer sweetness as much. Still delicious and I’ll try to always have one on hand, as it proves to be much easier to find than the rest. 4.5/5."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.15,"Pleasant aroma, nice complexity. Balanced sweetness with a hint of banana. Easy drinking for a high abv beer. Recommended."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.42,"Bottled February 2021 (I think...why can't they just put a date on the label??); drank 9/21/21 @ the Yarchives.

Cloudy orange/brown appearance.

An even pour yielded a big off-white head; a thick curtain of lace.

Plum, tobacco & candle wax flavors up front; banana & clove bite on the finish.

A phenomenal Quad."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4,"I loved the look and color of this brew - it was enticing and had the ""come hither"" look. Smell was just as I like - bready, fruity, with lots of vanilla and caramel. The feel was velvety, rich, and smooth. Unfortunately, it wasn't my preferred style so it didn't ""wow"" me like it does some others - not it's fault, mine."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.28,"Not my fav Quad but a good one. If you like Quads, this one has most of what you expect. Just a tad less punch flavor-wise than others."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.34,"750 ml bottle poured into a 15 cl St. Bernardus goblet.

L---Almost clear, rich amber color. Soapy, khaki head that had good retention and left excellent lacing.

S---Cherry, banana, candy sugar, bread.

T---Complex & rich. Follows the nose, banana, cherry, candy sugar and bread.

F---Fairly full bodied mouthfeel. Good carbonation.

O---Really a sipping beer, one meant to be enjoyed slowly. Overall, excellent.."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.83,"L: Murky, light amber/brownish in colour. 1 finger beige head at pour.
S: Banana bread, pears, candy sugar, peanuts, smells fresher than other quads (rochefort, st bernardus, ..). Some spice.
T: Candi sugar, overripe banana, pears.
F: Smooth, good carb, med/low bitterness, med body, sweet finish.
O: Different than what I think a classical quadruple should taste like, but good nevertheless."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),3.73,"Looka: light amber (very unusual for a quad), big cream head

Smell: malt, iron, yeast, a bit of fruit

Taste: malt, dark fruit, a bit of yeast, not nearly as good as the best quads

Feel: smooth, nice small bubbles on the tongue"
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.46,Need to perform a blind tasting but feel like this can become my #2 Quad behind Rochefort 10...really love the banana/clove/honey/almond/toasted coconut thing going on...this beer is less medicinal than other quads I've enjoyed before. Need to try more from not only this brewery but St. Bernardus too.
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.25,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10%. Deep amber to copper colour. Rich, very big and lasting off-white head. Lovely vinous aroma, also notes of brown candy sugar, caramel and various spices. The flavour is very rich and sweet, with plenty of malts, brown sugar and spices. Moderate hops in the finish."
La Trappe Quadrupel (Koningshoeven / Dominus),4.01,"750ml bottle into a goblet.

L: Clear chestnut body under an inch of almost-white, rather coarse foam. Despite the loose bubbles retention and lacing are both quite strong. Definitely on the light side for the style, but I'm enjoying it.

S: Fruit is front and center, with grape, pear, and apricot all showing up. Toasty malt is prominent as well, with some significant but not unwelcome alcohol character as well. Robust and enjoyable.

T: Follows the nose - fruity esters, rich toasty malts, and booze are the three flavor waves. Rather enjoyable, but not especially interesting in any way.

F: Lively and full-bodied, with lots of soft carbonation and some alcohol warmth. Pretty great for the style.

O: This is a style I don't drink nearly often enough, so it was supremely enjoyable to indulge in this one. That said, I think I prefer most of the other Trappist Quads to this one, solid as it is. Beers of Fame tick 205/250. Cheers!"
Backwoods Bastard,4.38,"Haven't had this in a while - and never rated it.

Very beautiful pour - nice brown caramel color and a bit of head.
No noticeable smell.
Very delicious. Creamy. Smooth mouthfeel. Not too much sweetness.

Excellent beer."
Backwoods Bastard,4.24,"12 oz bottle into a Founders snifter. Top popped and everything seemed to leap out!
Immediate Scotch aroma fills the space. Lively fizz that lays down quickly.
Taste is Scotch & soda, caramel sweetness, barrel dryness, quick finish.
Feel is old ale heft, low to medium carb.
Overall, supurb sipper.,."
Backwoods Bastard,4.41,"Pours a dark brownish color with a small tan colored head that didn't last long. The smell was of malt, caramel and a strong alcohol. The taste was that of malt with some caramel and the influence of the scotch barrels for a warm alcohol finish. A really good beer."
Backwoods Bastard,4.25,"Super hardcore and outrageous scotch and oak barrels combine nicely with the base scotch ale. It’s oaky, a bit roasty, with caramel sweetness, some tobacco and dark fruit. Bombastic but nice."
Backwoods Bastard,4.36,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Dark brown pour, with a light cream colored foam.

S - Vanilla, caramel, barrel.

T - Caramel, malt, vanilla, peat, black coffee. Starts sweet and works its way into a nice smooth bitterness.

F - Not heavy, but has a nice weight on the tongue. Creamy and dry at the same time.

The barrel cures the weak points of the original Dirty Bastard and turns it into an outstanding Wee Heavy."
Backwoods Bastard,4.5,My first scotch ale style beer. Simply great. Another great Founders beer.
Backwoods Bastard,3.96,Initially loved dirty bastard (the original) but just too much 'oak' for beer. Still a great beer with singular flavors and aromas but not my taste.
Backwoods Bastard,4.47,Ones of my favorites so I'm not very objective. Love the bourbon that comes through. This years version is a little thin but still very very good.
Backwoods Bastard,4.97,"I tried this brew a couple of years ago and remembered that I really liked. Today is the first time I have seen it back in stock at my local beer store so of course I had to try it again. I'm a fan of dark bourbon beers and this one ranks right up at the top. The initial pour unveils a dark amber ale with a short lived frothy head. The smell is sweet with an obvious bourbon scent. The first taste is remarkably smooth and rich, sweetness on the tongue with a mild pleasant bitterness arriving at the end which left me craving for my next sip. Ahhhhh, so yummy! This is a first class sipping beer that you should keep on hand for your favorite house guests...if your the generous type."
Backwoods Bastard,4.48,"Bottled on 09.27.21 - 2nd try on this one, which drives this very review - found the barrel taste too strong & fresh-coopered first time, but impressions seem to be diminished this round...)

Pour into 5oz snifter leaves an appealing bubbly tan head reducing to cloudy mists on the surface with a bubbly creamy little ring surrounding the fill line. Color such a lovely translucent deep burgundy. Nose is barrel woods, sweet molasses, perhaps a nuance of tangy fruitiness in there too. Taste is a lovely bittersweet, a little tang & fizz on the tongue. Swallow is bittersweet, not overly sticky.

I can see why appreciators like aging this one. It's a sweet lil' treat."
Backwoods Bastard,4.85,Superb scotch ale
Backwoods Bastard,4.49,"Fairly dark body, browinish burnt copper color with a decent light tan head. Very pretty aroma: caramel, vanilla & bourbon. Sweet with just of hint of bitter. Very tasty: caramel, brown sugar, spices, bourbon, scotch, ripe dark fruit, vanilla & oak barrel flavors. Medium feel, good carbonation & a fair amount of alcohol heat in the mouth & stomach. Excellent scotch ale."
Backwoods Bastard,4.51,"This sample was bottled 9/28/12. Poured into a 16oz nonic, a tan off white head forms and quickly dissipates leaving a light cap of foam on top. The color is a slightly translucent reddish brown. The smell is of boozy roasted malts, bourbon and candied dried fruit. The taste is slightly sweet, boozy malt, with notes of dried fruit and bourbon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick. Given the age of my sample I assume the carbonation has toned down from the original packaging, the mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I would definitely buy again."
Backwoods Bastard,4.23,"When compared to KBS it is a step lower. BUT - that does not make it undesirable. If you are a connoisseur of ales you will love it. If not - the pilsner people and BudNiks will notice the bloaty feeling and over-handed sweetness and put it down around a stale Oh Henry. Newbies will be hypnotized - the Seasoned will say ""meh."""
Backwoods Bastard,4.65,"This is a fantastic dark beer, especially considering you don't have to go to a boutique micro-brew in order to get it. It's available at my local grocery store! The flavors are complex without feeling artificial or over-powering. The bourbon barrel aging is evident. It forms a very nice, almost nitro-style head. IMHO, this is the best offering Founders puts out...which is saying a lot since they make some outstanding beers."
Backwoods Bastard,4.26,"11/7/21 from a 12 oz bottle 4 pack.... Birthday present from DW.

Nose: maple, pecan and bourbon barrel.
Taste: "" "" and brown sugar. Warms you up real nice! Nice and smooth front and back end. Wee heavy!"
Backwoods Bastard,4.28,"Notes from Thanksgiving Day 2019. Bottled on 6/26/2019.
12 oz bottle into a small snifter glass.
L: deep dark brown
S: bourbon, candied caramel, spicy peppery wood.
T: oak, bourbon, smoke, nuts, dried up fruit, figs, raisins, pectin, fruit cake, pecan pie. Not too sweet.
F: medium bodied and kind of sticky. Balanced and fairly smooth.
O: Deep, full flavored barrel beer with a hearty soul. There is light alcohol. It is excellent."
Backwoods Bastard,4.44,"Very smooth, malty ale. The dark fruit and caramel notes seem to be the most prominent for me. Highly drinkable for an 11%."
Trois Pistoles,3.97,"Dark walnut brown, reddish when light shines through. Tall head with good retention and some lacing. Lots of malty aroma. Malty flavors evolve through different spices and eventually into light smoke late on the long finish. Phenolic. No real alcoholic flavor despite ABV. Good feel in mouth. Gets better the more you drink of it."
Trois Pistoles,4.35,"Pours a dark brown with a run-away long lived tan head and a lot of lacing.

Smells of toasted malt and yeast with some sweet fruit.

Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, yeast, raisins, plumbs and spice with a warm alcohol finish.

Medium light body and light carbonation after the head recedes. Smooth mouthfeel.

This is one excellent, powerful sipper!"
Trois Pistoles,4.76,"Trois Pistoles pours a ruby red so dark as to be almost black with a thick off-white head that lasts forever.

The aroma brings to mind dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and strawberry jam, with a hint of dark chocolate underneath.

The flavour brings across all those dark fruit notes with just a hint of sweetness, and introduces the dark chocolate notes on the finish. There's a layered complexity and balance to the flavours that I only find in exceptional Belgian beers.

The carbonation is effervescent and gives the beer a really rich, decadent mouth feel. The 9% alcohol is very well hidden.

This is a truly fantastic beer! An awesome Belgian Dark ale, I think it compares very favourably against Quadruples as well. This is one of the tastiest, most complex and well balanced Belgians I've had, and everyone I've introduced this beer to has come away impressed. Unibroue has really outdone themselves here."
Trois Pistoles,4.22,"Bottle poured into a nonic

Brewers Notes: Drawing on Quebec folklore, Unibroue chose the name Trois Pistoles to honour the city’s historic importance and pay homage to the legend of the Black Horse. Conjured up by a priest to help build a new church, this incarnation of the devil ran off when its bridle was removed. Because construction was still underway when the horse vanished, a stone remains missing from the church to this day.

Dark cola like liquid capped by a foamy taupe foam which recedes to a thin layer

Aroma is malts, dark fruits , raisins, figs

Taste is dark fruits, figs, raisins , malts

Mouthfeel is soft , fizzy

Good beer"
Trois Pistoles,4.39,"Poured a thundercloud of foam into a Gordon Biersch Maibock glass. The aroma was sweet malty with a hint of coriander. The taste has spice with stone fruit with a medium creamy mouthfeel that easily settles on the palate. Without a hint of the ABV, it's between sippable and crushable, though it's for sipping for flavor."
Trois Pistoles,4.26,"A: Pours a deep brown with a brief 3 finger tan head that fades to a smooth cap. It leaves lots of soapy lacing on the sides.

S: Aromas of caramel and molasses. No hop aromas.

T: Taste follows the nose. And with only 15.5 IBUs, you're not going to taste any hops, either.

F: Smooth with tingling carbonation, moderately full bodied. At 9% it's strong, but it's not going to knock you on your butt.

O: Overall, it's a good value. An excellent take on Belgian-style strong dark, by a solid Canadian brewery. This and Maudite are probably my favorites from UniBroue."
Trois Pistoles,4.49,"I bought this for the Trippel tasting weekend, not sure why, but here we are. Obviously rating as a Belgian style Dark Ale.
Poured dark, like reddish cola and managed to get about 5 mm of head of beige foam which pretty much stayed the whole time.
The aroma was more dark fruits like raisins and prunes; not sweet at all, very pleasant.
The taste followed, mouth-filling flavor of malty goodness.
The feel was almost viscous, which considering all the flavor and the ABV, it made perfect sense. Excellent sipper.
This one turned out to be a happy mistake, I'll definitely revisit it on purpose."
Trois Pistoles,4.36,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass

Pours a murky dark mahogany color with some reddish hues, and a medium tan head that recedes quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is sweet; consisting of cherries, raisins, dates, brown sugar, a mild spiciness, and a pronounced booziness.

The flavor follows the nose closely, with a mix raisins, plums, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of spiciness. Also, as with the nose, there is a strong booziness, but not overly strong, just enough to alert you to the 9% abv. Full bodied and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will be revisiting"
Trois Pistoles,4.23,"Pours a cloudy, very dark brown with a finger thick head of tightly packed bubbles.

As with many of Unibroue’s offerings, they have a hallmark style with their Belgians — leans fruity, and leans on the subtler yet complex side of things. This is no different. Complex nose that is hard to pick apart the malty side, spiced fruitcake, gentle cloves, fresh dark fruits like cherry. Molasses and toffee.

Flavour follows the nose pretty tightly. Alcohol is well hidden but the warmth it has adds a dimension to the flavour profile, a woody sherry like flavour. More malt here than on the nose, especially on the finish which recalls toasted bread and spongy chocolate coffered toffee and sugared apples. Bits of yeastiness wax and wane throughout your palate as you sip it.

Incredible mouthfeel. It foams very, very hard in your mouth but the carbonation is not particularly prickly. This gives it a very foamy mouthfeel on the way down. Medium bodied beer that is relatively sweet, no real bitterness here. Medium-high level of carbonation, especially noticeable in that sip, but the carbonation is not overly biting. Nice subtle but long finish leaving a gentle sweetness, yeasty grains, and dark fruits on the palate.

As mentioned before, I find almost all of Unibroue’s offerings to be milder on the flavour strength than Belgian styles from Belgium itself. That doesn’t make it bad, but they lean towards a more mild and complex flavour profile. They also tend to be more fruity than malty, and that is the case here. They write that rum flavours abound in the nose and palate, my experience has been with the fruity side of the beer it has a strong port or sherry side rather than rum, but you can get a rum taste. It’s just not as strong as other Belgian styles or malty Eisbocks.

Overall it’s quite a formidable beer, just as good as anything out of Belgium, while carving out its own unique niche and noticeable flavour profile on its own. At the same time, mild enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker, even though new to the style. Unibroue really does not tend to miss on any of their beers"
Trois Pistoles,4.61,"Cloudy, very dark brown, khaki head, ok retention and lace
Rum soaked, spiced fruitcake
Spiced rum, smooth cocoa, dried cherries, plums, and raisins, carrot cake minus the frosting
Medium light bodied and appropriately carbonated
Another banger"
Trois Pistoles,4.54,"Wow. Fiancé Raul called this one ‘three guns,’ but like Jimmy Stewart in Winchester ‘73, Raul only needs one. It just encompasses you Like the first day of fall: foliage in glorious ecstasy. It’s full and vibrant like Carl Winslow on Thanksgiving.

I’m gone."
Trois Pistoles,4.36,"A real beauty to look at, from the dark brown body to the large, lasting tan head to the graceful lace. Layers of rich malts in the aroma where you can pick out dark fruit, pitted fruit, molasses, brown bread and probably a few other favorite descriptors. Just don't count on too many hop varieties. Taste leans the same way although the hops come into play a bit more. Spiciness is more noticeable, especially in the aftertaste. Sweetness is a factor while bitterness is minimal. Mouthfeel is full bodied and decently carbonated. Check the ABV before guzzling more than two."
Trois Pistoles,4.6,Delicious strong beer
Trois Pistoles,4.18,"Thick creamy head that can runaway if not poured carefully. Good amount of lacing that doesn't have any intentions of leaving. Strong dark grainy, slightly sweet smell. Strong sour notes, light bitterness and classic Belgian taste. Somewhat astringent on the backend.

I love Unibroue's offerings and this one doesn't fail to impress. For sure in the top tier Belgians. You can tell it's strong however as the alcohol is present."
Trois Pistoles,5,"Excellent quality. Belgian ale (Dubbel) Made in Canada. Price is Excellent as well, compared to Belgian dubbels.Dark fruit, cocoa, and smooth. 2 thumbs up."
Trois Pistoles,4.04,"It was nice to pick up three Unibroue singles a few weeks ago. This was the one new-to-me brew of the bunch. And what a great brew it is. Unibroue seems to always make very easy drinking versions of styles that are often not the easiest.

This pours a gorgeous deep brown with tons of fine foamy head. The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well. I should get a sixer and put some up.

Recommended. I will be happy to have this again some time - it is a nice and easy version of the style while not being phony or wimpy."
Trois Pistoles,4.14,"L: Dark brown color, not quite black. Tan tall head that dissipates into a centimeter of coating on top. Moderate lacing that sticks.

S: Black cherries. Sweet malt. Undertones of alcohol. I might be crazy but it smells a little bit like coca-cola.

T: sweet and thick are the dominant characteristics. More dark fruit, cherry and raisin. Bitter/sharp on the back end that can make it feel not as heavy as it really is.

F: medium-full bodied. A nice level of carbonation.

O: close in profile to Belgian darks. Has some interesting qualities of fruit and tartness but still doesn’t top actually Belgian’s to me. Still very good."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.55,Has a unique and very complex taste I really liked.
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.29,"No evident canning date. Poured into an Other Half snulip glass. It pours an opaque, bright, dirty tangerine color with almost a finger of fluffy, milk-white head and thick, clinging lacing. Lots of lemon, grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple on the nose along with floral hops. There is a good balance of sweet and tart citrus, including the aforementioned lemon, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, and pineapple, and notes of ripe melon but the malt provides a rich, earthy backdrop from the oats and wheat. Others have commented on the hop burn but I find the bitterness to be clean and manageable. The mouth feel is terrific: rich and fluffy with appropriate carbonation, and the 8.5% ABV gives it good substance without overpowering. Overall, I have a feeling that this can is past its prime. It's a fine NEIPA for sure but I can't justify the World-Class rating."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.59,"A high rating for sure but it's well deserved. Melon + grapefruit nose with a hazy appearance in the glass. Citrus notes abound with a creamy mouthfeel and satisfying finish. NEIPA lovers will swoon for this beer that's on par with Treehouse, in my opinion. Cheers"
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.15,"Pours a milky hazy yellow/gold; one finger of creamy white foam; excellent cap retention; heavy ring and medium heavy lacing. Earthy hoppy grapefruit nose. Taste follows with bitter grapefruit peel. Full minus body; no astringency; grainy/dusty feel; moderate minus carbonation. Overall, another drinkable (for me) hazy from OH; not too full or fluffy; enjoyable light bitter linger. Nice."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,3.32,"16 oz. can. Cloudy yellow. Smells of acidic fruit, sweet pale malt, earthy yeast. Tastes of sharply tangy hops: passion fruit, lime. Garlic and onion behind it, lingering into the finish. Sweet, but the sharp and earthy hops overwhelm it. Finishes dry and leafy. Medium body. It's intense. Not bad for the style, but abrasive and not all that easy to drink."
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.44,"a: very hazy and fluffy looking dark orange color. a hint of creamy yellow in there with some copper. pours a 1.5 finger solid white head

s: tangerines and grapefruit upfront. mango, pineapple, peaches follow. some crackers, tangy citrus zest, and some creamsicle. a hint of guava, strawberry, and kiwi towards the end as well. aroma on this is so creamy

t: like the aroma, grapefruit and tangerines upfront. some decent earthy and grapefruity bitterness is apparent immediately. creamsicles, orange juice, guava behind that. some mango sorbet and a touch of that tangy pineapple. a nice crackery note and a bit of raw hop burn on the tongue

m: medium, super fluffy mouthfeel. medium carbonation

o: awesome beer, and another example for me of why NEDIPA should be a style. this does a great job of being tropical, and getting it's sweetness from the hops - not sweet sticky malts. mouthfeel is spot on. i'd like perhaps just a little bit less burn. still great stuff"
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,3.65,"16 fl oz pull-tab can courtesy of Edms79 - thanks, man!

Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,4.9,"#91, yummy!"
KBS,4.56,"The best high ABV and I love it. At 80, this is what keeps me going. The chocolate flavor is amazing. I know from the color it was what I wanted. One of these is all I need."
KBS,4.75,"Attractive thick tan head, fairly opaque. Delicious combination of coffee/chocolate/bourbon. A little sweeter and more overtly chocolate than my ideal, but still extremely good."
KBS,4.38,"This is a highly-rated beer which prompted me to try it. It's wonderfully complex - chocolate and bourbon on the nose, full-bodied and rich with a velvety mouth feel, finishing off with more bourbon, a little bitterness, and a hint of sweetness."
KBS,4.75,World class stout. It hardly gets better than this.
KBS,4.36,"Black, beige foam, ok.
Toasted smell, chocolate, coffee, artichoke. Intense. Good.
Salty caramel, vanilla. Barrel notes, smooth and chocolately. Almost oily.
Bitter aftertaste, again caramel and vanilla. Oak.
A classic, very good."
KBS,5,"A most impressive imperial stout. Beautiful chocolate color with a light head rising to the top. Respectfully strong but smooth, light hints of bourbon and chocolate taste. Not over powering and does not disappoint. This beer clearly demands a high rating! My favorite stout to date."
KBS,4.43,"An American Classic. Lovely.,."
KBS,4.9,"So happy to see this on a SW Florida Publix supermarket shelf today. I am a bourbon lover and I can't imagine a better partner for a fine, high proof bourbon than this beer. Enjoying my first bottle with a healthy pour of Lil'Book Chapter 3. Dinner can wait."
KBS,3.94,"Very much like Kentucky Bourbon Barrel, which stands to reason.
Good textures and colors."
KBS,3.83,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, bourbon. Taste is strong of bourbon, some chocolate, a bit on the boozy side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I was expecting more based on the ratings here."
KBS,4.75,Fantastic.
KBS,4.76,"Poured from bottle into snifter after about a day in the 50 degree wine cooler.
Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful
Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.
Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.
Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.
Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff"
KBS,4.44,"Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.

Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°

Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly!

L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom.

S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall

T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes.

F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth"
KBS,4.56,"pretty delicious stout, not too much comes close. love the blend of choco and coffee."
KBS,5,"Look: Poured from a 12 oz into a glass - Midnight black pour just like a stout. lightly thin/ brown foam risen to the surface. Quickly dissolves over time. A bit of lacing on the sides like some of these bubbles don't want to give up.
Smell: Getting the heavy notes of sweet bourbon barrels - getting some chocolatey vanilla aromas to it. Not much on the coffee side this pour.
Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!
Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.
Overall: This bad boy proves to live up to it's standards. Wasn't sure because barrel aged stouts aren't my route but this proved me differently. Will buy again and if you haven't tried it. This is a must try beer!"
KBS,4.51,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snulip glass. Bottled on 9/9/21.

L---Darkest brown color. Fairly thin light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left ok lacing. Head doesn't sound like much, but I think it's actually pretty good for the high ABV.

S---Strong chocolate, lighter vanilla and bourbon barrel. Not as much coffee as I was expecting.

T---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness.

F---Medium/full bodied with minimal carbonation. Almost a creamy texture with no alcohol burn.

O---I have been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. The best offering from an excellent brewery."
KBS,3.72,"I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.

L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.

S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.

T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.

F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink.

O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.

Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future."
KBS,3.95,Very strong coffee and bourbon flavors. The coffee flavor seemed a little odd to me.
KBS,4.45,"Beautiful color and head. Notes of chocolate. Slight coffee flavor while sipping. Very slight bourbon taste, which is fine. Very delicious, but not as rich as I was hoping or expecting.

Updating: Having had many more bottles of this, I am more impressed. It is not a thick stout, but it is really delicious. Price really ranges from store to store, so certainly worth buying when I get a good price."
KBS,4.58,"1/5/22 Bottled 10/14/21. Chocolate predominates aroma & taste then coffee. Full bodied, smooth & sweet. Beautiful creamy head. Excellent but prefer slightly less alcohol."
KBS,4.83,"Very similar to CBS and also just as good. I lack the finer filters to define taste as well as most other reviews can, but I do enjoy the taste of this beer."
Very GGGreennn,4.03,"16oz. Can served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours a dull orange hue with a turbid clarity and loose, 1/8th inch, bright white head that slowly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders. Nose is a big orange juice bomb with a hint of pith and herbal notes. Taste consistent with nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an easy, even carbonation. Quite drinkable, but I don’t understand the hype."
Very GGGreennn,4.75,"Canned 8/10/22. Purchased 8/16/22 at Charlton.

L: Pours an opaque yellow gold with a one-finger head that quickly thins to a film on top but creates a thick ring around the glass. Beautiful lacing, with big stripes circling the glass.

S: Aromas of mango and peach jump out of the pour.

T: More peach and mango up front, transitioning to more general citrus/tropical in the middle. Finishes with an exceptional dry bitterness that is just right.

F: The classic Tree House soft mouthfeel is on display here, with just enough prickliness at the end to keep the tastebuds alert.

O: A magnificent example of what a NEDIPA can be. An aroma that recalls the finest fruit produce at the farmer's market. A taste that's juicy without being thick or sweet. A feel that's pillowy but keeps you awake. It's all here."
Very GGGreennn,4.75,"Serving: Can
Canned: Aug-10-2022

Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.
Truly loverly.

Very GGGreennn,5,"I have not rated a beer in awhile, but this one deserves the effort. For a second I thought I had Very Green in two different labels and wondered why this one tasted so much better. I brought back a couple of cases from my camping trip of all sorts of shades of Green. The sweet floral aroma out of the can translated right into the flavor and held strong the whole way through to the end of the can. That is rare. The malt backbone was just strong enough to hold it all together without getting in the way. Wow! I wish I had more.

One more note: This tasting was after the beer was in the can for 1 1/2 months."
Very GGGreennn,4.4,"16oz can dated 6/2/22.

Pours turbid gold with plenty of tattered lacework and persistent retention. Pineapple pith with spruce bark and a hint of mint bubblegum in the nose. Medium bodied with a full, frothy body. Dried pineapple with grapefruit and pine on the palate. Finishes with minimal malt and a drying bitterness."
Very GGGreennn,4.5,"This beer pours a beautiful, turbid pineapple color with a creamy oatmeal head that coats the glass all the way down. The nose features a significant dank citrus note, along with spicy passion fruit, mango, and pineapple aromas.

There’s dank citrus flavors up front on taste, but it’s that passion fruit/mango/pineapple trifecta that makes this beer for me, and the full, creamy mouthfeel that accompanies the bit of hop bite at the back end is just the cherry on top of this excellent beer."
Very GGGreennn,4.42,"Canned on 6/2/22; consumed on 6/17/22

Pours a turbid, mango purée-esque body topped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, slightly off-white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and thin, soapy curtains of webby/spotty lacing draping down the entirety of the walls of the glass.

Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.

Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.

Myriad juicy fruits and boggy hops bring an onslaught of lush, full-flavored character within an overtly resinous containment; supremely, comprehensively expressive, this is an immense display of hop variation from Tree House at its peak."
Very GGGreennn,4.99,"Best of the green line - and by far - the extra kettle hop delivers just the perfect amount of hop bite, but is extra smooth and creamy in mouthfeel."

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not really sure what this is other than a variation of ""Green"" so I'll leave that up to you to research, I'm just going to drink it! It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of creamy white foam. The aroma expresses passionfruit, soft orange, nectarine, and hop resins. Tasting it reveals a sweetish, basic malt that's bready and must be made up of of 2-row brewers malt as well as wheat and oats although I can't taste the oats specifically. I'm finding passionfruit, pineapple, peach, orange, and lemon/lime as well as more hop resin. There's a lot of hop bite to it, and a decent amout of bitterness although there's also a lot of malt to balance it. Things are becoming clearer to me now - this is a double IPA, and not just a more heavily hopped version of ""Green"". I actually like it better. The additional maltiness softens it and allows the hop flavors to come through more clearly. It seems less bitter, although it's probably got more IBUs. Beyond that, the hop bite is smoothed out. There's additional alcohol but it doesn't stick out any more than you want it to in a double IPA. It's dry in the finish but not as dry as the original, and it's certainly not as seemingly bitter and biting overall. I find it very rounded and smooth, while at the same time still a bit of a hulk of a beer. I'm about halfway through so let me comment on the head retention and lacing, and then the mouthfeel. The head has held up really well and I still have a creamy surface covering. The lacing covers the glass with swirling 'stained glass' and sweeping waves breaking into spots of sea foam. Almost all of the Treehouse beers have great head retention and lacing and this is no exception. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and beautifully smooth and fluffy. I am impressed!
Review #7,969"
Triple (White),4.31,"Poured at fridge temp. Unknown bottling date as I can't find anything that resembles a date on the bottle. Pours a beautiful orange with fluffy white head. Some murky and definitely opaque. The nose is orange creamsicle, bread, wheat, a floral note, and some grass. Very malty and wonderful.

The taste is amazing. Sweet toffee, maple, bready malts, cereal, lemon, orange, a bit of vanilla, slight hoppy bitterness, an earthy note, and a significant floral note. Great balance between sweet fruit/toffee and bitter hops. Wonderful.

Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp. A bit on the dry side. Overall, a fantastic tripel!"
Triple (White),4.25,Delicious triple strong ale!
Triple (White),4.07,"2 inch white, billowing, creamy, thick head with very good retention, that leaves sticky lacing around the glass and forms a rocky, uneven surface as it does recede. Hazy golden amber with very active carbonation.

Strong aroma; I can smell it while pouring. Bready, light fruit, and spice. Sweet-ish.

The initial taste carries indistinct fruit - pear, perhaps, bread, floral, and peppery spice. A solid bitterness begins in the middle, along with some citrus, and continues into the finish and aftertaste. This is the most bitter of any tripel so far for me. The finish brings a bit of an earthy character. The level of bittering is in APA territory, which I was not expecting. In fact, the package of flavors, with the citrus, floral, and bitterness, is more APA than any of the other Belgian-style tripel ales I had. It is very tasty, but certainly different from others in the style. While the aroma seemed to promise sweetness, the finish is quite dry.

Mouth feel has a moderate body with the carbonation bubbles active on my tongue.

Overall, a tasty beer, nothing out of balance, but a bit of an outlier in the company of the other Belgian tripels. It definitely brings more from the hops (citrus and bitterness) than do the others."
Triple (White),4.43,"Lovely surprise. 33ml bottle purchased at grocery store in Belgium. Poured into IKEA 8 oz. glass. Surprisingly light, spicier and hoppier than I expected, and while you can tell there's a lot of malt involved, crisp, not sweet. Very smooth drinking and no alchohol heat - wouldn't guess it's a tripel. Not a lot of depth, but has the distinctive Belgian yeast banana-y flavors. A fastball right down the middle — nothing fancy, but a very nice example of the style. In the upper range of the 20-odd Belgians sampled this week."
Triple (White),4.16,"330 ml. bottle stamped L20-274, poured into a Belgian chalice.
Copper colored with scant fine white head. No lacing, small surface ring. This seems unusual, and may be the result of age or mishandling.
Smells like bread yeast, citrus, grapes, peppers.
Bitter pear, clove, yeast, pale malt, citrus, wine flavors.
Medium bodied, bitterness recedes and reveals more flavor. No alcohol heat. I will try again as this bottle is likely not representative."
Triple (White),4.14,"330 ml bottle poured into a goblet

A- A fairly clear golden copper with a two white head.

S- Banana bread, touch of apples/pears, slightly earthy, nice yeast character, some sugary sweetness.

T- Sweet bread, apples/pears, touch of bananas, earthy spice, some yeast.

M- Smooth, light to medium body, dry.

O- A very nice Tripel with good balance. Easy to drink."
Triple (White),4.13,"Sampling a 330cl bottle at cellar temp poured into my chalice. Picked up at a beer shop two weeks ago and in my cellar since then. L20-540 on the label is closest to a date stamp I can find.
The beer pours a rich copper color with lots of fine suspended sediment floating around. A fluffy dense head of bleached white foam rises up 2 cm and almost overflows the glass. This foam sticks around as a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass. this lattice clings on throughout the tasting.
Aroma is some bready malts and fruity pear notes with a bit of general spiciness, never any booze notes.
First sip reveals a medium body with soft and gentle carbonation.
Flavor is some bready malt, green apple and pears and a bit of sweeter spices, maybe coriander. This isnt cloying or a candy sweet beer but Im not getting any sort of bite from hops nor peppery ABV. I just drank Allagash Tripel before this one and found these to be fairly different beers."
Triple (White),3.68,"L - Shared half a 12 oz. bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. One finger foamy light head. Cloudy dark wheat color. Thin lacing.

S - Light bready / cracker malts. Some heavy spice along with hops.

T - A mix of malt and dry hops. A good mix of light malt and light bitterness. The floral taste hops have a little sourness. The bitterness is more pronounced as you drink.

F - Medium-to-thin mouthfeel. Foamy carbonation.

O - Overall this is a fine beer, but tried it immediately after the Chimay Blue, and this Chimay White was not as well-liked. I’m glad I tried it and would recommend it to people looking for a tasty light hoppy beer, but I’m not going to add it to my rotation."
Triple (White),4.26,"Pours a hazy, amber colour. Even with the most careful of pours, a three finger tight and dense head appears, with another finger tall rocky, foamy head. This is my usual glass goblet, but I don’t know what happened, tons of bubbles are running up all over little spots on the glass. As if there were nucleation points on the side, which there isn’t. As I waited to pour the rest of the beer in, I realized… the head is not collapsing. Not after 5 minutes, not after 15, and not even through the whole half hour I drank this beer. Something happened I’ve never seen before which is that the head actually grew in the initial minutes of the pour and the rocky foamy head coalesced into the middle of the glass like an actual mountain. I don’t know if this was just some crazy unique thing, but it’s so gorgeous looking I honestly want to give it my first ever 5.

Sweet, delicious doughy yeast on the nose. Caramel malts, tasty spices such as pepper, coriander, a hint of cinnamon. A bit of banana and cloves here too. Sugared apricot for the fruity notes. It’s a Belgian, and even more it’s an abbey beer, they just always smell so good.

Taste follows the nose and then some. It is not disappointing at all. There is more balancing hop bitterness here than other Tripels, not citrusy, but a little bit grassy, funky and floral. Doughy yeast and moist, chewy bread flavours are unbelievably pleasant. Tripels and Quads can aim for a few different categories, some have those fruity esters like Westmalle, some aim for the sweet malt rum raisin flavours like Abt 12. Chimay White aims for a pleasant balance. There isn’t as much raisin, rum, dark fruit flavour here however, as the floral and mildly funky, wheaty malts balancing the sweetness and bitterness is more this beers thing. Gentle spices dance throughout the sip as well, mostly cloves. Mild funk adds a slightly savouriness to the beer. Toffee, caramel, and dried candy fruit rinds can also be tasted.

Pleasant and subtle finish that is dry in character, this beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bittersweet on the palate as it dries.

Chimay White occupies a unique space in the Tripel category, but definitely deserves to be ranked higher. It stands out from the crowd and has its own little niche of flavours, enough to stand beside other unique tripels like Westmalle, Tripel Karmeliet, Rochefurt, etc. It’s not quite as malty and sweet as others, but still has pleasant chewy doughiness to it. It doesn’t have the deep molasses, rum, raisin character either, nor does it have tons of fruity esters. It’s very balanced and yet despite that still carries strong notes of its own character.

As for all Belgian Abbey tripels, it’s phenomenal. You really can’t ever go wrong with these brewers in this style!"
Triple (White),4.26,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice glass, there is no date on the bottle that I could find, price $6.99.

APPEARANCE: pours a beautiful orange/amber color with two-fingers off-white head that persisted nicely until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, there are larger bits of suspended sediment when held us to light, medium carbonation.

SMELL: brown sugar, banana bread, spice and a little Belgian funk.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, banana bread and spice then a subdued Belgian funk on the finish.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: This is a really nice Tripel, it looks great in the glass and does not disappoint, Chimay is my favorite Belgian brewery (sorry Westvleteren), I would buy this again and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."
Triple (White),4.28,"Ruby golden orange, fluffy one finger head. Good retention on the side of the glass. Aroma: light banana, candi sugar, yeast,, some faint spices.

Triple (White),4.67,"Pours a cloudy, deep amber coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of caramel malt, toffee, estery/hoppy fruit with notes of apricot, apple and citrus, as well as hints of estery spice. Taste is a perfect balance of caramel malt, toffee, estery fruit and spice, with notes of red apple, apricot, clove and cardamon, as well as some bitter, citrus hops, with notes of orange rind. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some toffee, citrus and estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

While I love Tripel Karmeliet, this has got to be my new favorite Tripel. The balance of malt, hops and yeast is just absolutely superb here, with some sweet caramel malt and toffee, bitter and citrussy hops, as well as fruity and spicy notes that complement each other incredibly well. I really like how prominent the hops are here, with some citrus notes and a good bitterness that prevents this from becoming too sweet against the rich caramel malt backdrop, while those fruity esters really stand out as well, with a good spiciness and great body and mouthfeel as well."

Triple (White),4.48,"Managed to avoid the current and recent reviews :)

Personally, I love the smoothness and balance of Chimay beers, they are some of the best.

I hope this is good, before I have had only blue and red :)

Beautiful orange amber colour, shines in the light, good froth level, that stays.

Deep, fruit and spice aroma. Apricot prominent. Seriously deep and mystical.

Very citrussy. Really overpowering, though also enjoyably intense. Better than Delirium Tremens as it has much more levels of flavour. Also, better than Duvel for the same reason. The balance of elements is mastered at a much higher level, this is a truly complex flavour on the tongue. The fizziness lasts for about a minute, and constantly changes taste. This is more than just a beer..! It is a creation of pure elegance and complexity.

Is there a bit too much bitterness and orange peel flavour..? For some people, yes. It really depends on one's tastebuds.

It does have elements of Duvel. Though it takes to a new level. However Duvel limited edition tripel that I had a few weeks ago is as good as this, though more apricotty.

For me Chimay are the best Belgian Trappiste brewers by far. Blue is still my favourite ; )"
Triple (White),3.37,Maybe not the prettiest triple. it has a great Belgian funk but is a little rough around the edges.
Triple (White),4,"It smells funky, fruity and spicy. Like a spiced wine with funky yeast.

It tastes like sparkling wine, cinnamon and other warming spices. It's also fresh and sweet.

It's thin with a ton of bubbly carbonation. The finish is dry, bittersweet and long.

Overall it's a brilliant triple. I give it a 4.8 out of 6."
Palate Wrecker,3.94,"Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten. ABV is 9.5%. Hazy orange colour, large white head. Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops. The flavour is indeed a ""palate wrecker"" - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly ""well balanced"" - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a ""typically American double IPA"", and I’ve ""seen it before""- but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!"
Palate Wrecker,4.25,As bitter as they come.
Palate Wrecker,4,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Bright orange color.

Small white head; no lacing.

Smells strongly of high grade marijuana.

Medium mouthfeel, bordering on thick.

Taste is of grapefruit and great ganja. Booze is present but not overpowering.

A delicious beer."
Palate Wrecker,4.06,"Good solid imperial IPA. Not up there with the best, but nice and solid. In tap at Industry Public House on Leah's b-day weekend in Pittsburgh! Good ending for lunch!

Palate Wrecker,4.19,"From notes 3/9/13: Pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, creamy, drying, oily and drawing."
Palate Wrecker,4.26,"Pleasantly surprised, as it is not as intense as I thought after reading the description. Hoppy for sure, but relatively smooth and slick. Some malt comes through the hop assault as well, making this a tasty beer. Cheers!"
Palate Wrecker,3.96,"From the 12 oz. bottle. Pours clear copper/gold color. Hop forward, boozy smell with hints of orange and pine. Malty bitter taste with hints of honey, grapefruit and pine. Bitter to the end. Pretty good but not my fave."
Palate Wrecker,4.31,"12 oz bottle - not really fresh (best by Aug 2017 - now November 2017) so I would like to try fresh b ut.... despite not fresh kept refrigerated and this was fantastic. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with 1-2 finger head. Caramel malt with citrus/tropical fruit aroma. Taste is sweet citrus, pineapple with distinct pine flavour followed by a dank sticky bitterness coating the mouth. Bites you and then begs you to have more. Appropriately boozy. Great!

Repeat visit as showed up in Edmonton July 2019 .... still great!"
Palate Wrecker,4.53,"So if you only Love in a beer is hops you can't really do too much better here cause this stops just short of a hop smoothie. I myself am a hops hunter so this is great. The look is about a 9 or 10 in srm in a clear glass in natural sunlight it is a 7. That's a little light since most DIPA is at least a 10. The smell is sweet and piny, nice and smooth with a nice thick forestry sting. The taste is pure hops. You can definitely feel the alcohol but you technically can't tast it cause of the power of the hops. The feel is heavy like a stout with a nice finish that reminds you of a morning coffee. Overall this is a Heavy DIPA that might be able to just get away within the fabled Triple IPA class. It begins and ends with the word Hops"

Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.1,Well balanced and lower alcohol volume. Great Summer Drinking Beer. Thank you Deschutes for making a True Pale Ale.
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.23,"I'm not usually keen on pale ales, I'm sort of more of a pilsener guy (although back when I was young I brewed ales). What surprised me about this one was twofold: a really nicely balanced beer, with neither the hops or malt taking charge, and the alcohol content. I don't care for really alcoholic beers at my age (68)."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.98,"can dated 3/18; today is 5/31

pours a fairly clear amber gold body with a burnt-off-white fluffy foam froth head that has moderately low retention, peaking at a finger-and-a-half and leaving occasional patches of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a super thin murked cap with a thin but defined halo

aroma is caramel malt, slight pine and orange, lemon, and grass

taste follows that up, pretty straightforwardly. orange marmalade and caramel malt take center stage

mouthfeel is higher carbonation and medium-light body that runs crisp, slightly watery, and grainy, with a crisp dry finish and a lemon-laced caramel malt aftertaste

overall:
a far from boring session worthy pale ale that aligns itself with more traditional pale's of the english variety at times, while bringing in solid pine resin notes to boot. solid digs"
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.85,"Apple cider in color. Not much of a head. Smells mild, citrus hops, hints of lemon. Malty upfront and on the body, surprisingly. The hops come out at the end. It finishes dry.
This is balanced very well— the malt and hops are blended together so well it’s a little hard to tell what’s what, and I think that’s a good thing for this beer. It’s mild, it’s subtle, it’s an easy drinking pale ale. What else could you ask for?"

12oz can served in a tulip. Dated 02-10-21. It was left in my AirBnB fridge, so I'm pretty stoked by the relatively reasonable date.

Pours a surprisingly dark amber with a medium sized head. It's not hazy, but it's not clear. There are definitely some little flakes of sediment floating around and there and settling into the bottom of the glass. Smell is nice, clear piny grassy hoppy notes and a definite malty/grain sweetness.

Taste is pretty much what a pale ale ought to be. Moderate grainy sweetness, a tiny bit of a tea like characteristic, maybe the slightest nuttiness or toffee to spice things up a little bit, medium but building pine bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is medium-light with a very dry finish. Overall, this is a classic pale ale.

Another 12oz can, this one dated 2022-01-19, so substantially older than the last one. Starting to show off a little bit of the ""old hay"" characteristic I associate with old hops, but not too much. Generally, consistent with my previous notes."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.68,"L- Dozens of oatmeal colored random chunks sinking in a dusty amber colored beer. Short lived 2F cream light khaki foam head fades to almost nothing with minor lace. Transparency is about 50%

N-Almost nothing when cold and about the same as it warms, just a bi of caramel malt, at least no off notes.

T- Interesting oat biscuit malt hits first, then a smooth light sweetness that leads up to a lightly bitter finish. This malty sweetness is nicely balanced with a tangy hop note that keep you coming back for some more.

M- Smooth and slick with light carbonation and a finish that keeps it lightly dry with a touch of sticky thickness.

O- I had this first almost a year ago when I kept a tasting spreadsheet. I thought it was too bitter at that time, but my palate has become more experienced. This is pretty tasty at this point in my journey."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,2.81,"355 ml bottle, from Fakta, Denmark. BB date 30.05.2014. ABV is 5%. Amber colour, slightly hazy with some floaties. Moderate off-white head. Aroma of caramelized stale orange marmalade, basement and dust, a whiff of solvent. Soft mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. The flavour is mild with a slight fruitiness, the finish is drier and ""dusty"" with very moderate hops. Has apparently not had any benefit from cellaring, might rerate if I find a fresh bottle."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.93,"Look: Nearly clear medium-dark orange with a generous off-white head that forms a pillow up top and slowly recedes, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Lemon/lime, tangerine, warm bready malt, rose-led floral notes, lightly toasted cereal grains, and light berry notes
Taste: A slew of citrus fruits and flowers rush onto the palate and hold before bready malt notes come and join in the fold. Citrus and floral hops retake center stage and lead to a hoppy finish
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and slightly soft on the finish with no detectable dryness
Overall: Tasty stuff here as it should be. A Pacific Northwest cult classic and continues to be unwavering in its presentation – citrus and floral hops, good bready malt presence, clean, and ridiculously quaffable. I hadn’t had a sixer as a stand-alone in some time and it was a much-welcomed reminder of just how well-made and good this beer is and has always been. Recommended"
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.03,"Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is copper, transparent, head is light tan with very fine bubbles and presents 2 fingers thick, heads laces well.

Smell is light caramel malt, toast, then crisp hops with earth, grass and light herbal notes.

Taste is similar with toasted and light caramel malt, hops with earth, grass, and light herbs.

Mouthfeel is low/moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, well balanced bitterness with drying.

Overall an excellent pale ale, maybe a little light on the aroma and flavor but what is there is classic flavor and drinkability."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,4.09,"Let's take a 12 ounce bottle of Mirror Pond, pour it into a clear pint glass and reflect on the results. First, it's a beautiful bright copper color, with good carbonation leaving a nice off-white head and lacing. It's smell is a little perfumish. There's a nice malt start to the taste and a good hop presentation at the finish. Overall a very nice beer experience."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.5,"Great, hoppy pale ale that hits all the right marks and is very well made. I’d drink it anytime, but I wouldn’t choose it over less malty pale ales, like a hip hazy pale ale. Sounds cheesy, but it’s true. I want super dry hopped goodness these days. With that said, I’d drink this anytime and if it were the only beer available at a restaurant or bar I’d be totally ok with that."
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.89,Dredge
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,3.77,"A-Copper, slight haze, minimal head
S-Almost indistinguishable, slight floral notes and some bready malt notes
T-Neutral citrus, some floral and grassy undertones, and the malts more prominent on the palate than the nose. Modest sweetness, little to no bitterness.
M-Light body, minimal carbonation, but good smooth feel and clean finish (the best part of the brew, makes it refreshing)
O-Classic pale ale"
Weissbier Hell,4.28,"Picked up a pint bottle from TW-Greenville, SC 5-23-22 for $4.49. Bottle code L1471; consumed 7-31-22.

Beer poured a hazy gold with a very nice white head.

Nose is very phenolic, of cloves and bubble gum.

Taste follows the nose with a lighter malt base that allows the yeast to shine which gives the classic banana and cloves notes along with a touch of bubble gum. Finishes nicely balanced from an appropriate amount of hops.

Mouthfeel is lovely as each sip finishes very soft and smooth.

Overall an excellent example of the style!"
Weissbier Hell,4,"Bottled and I don’t know if they bottle condition German biers but I doubt it
Pours a hazy wheat coloured body with good white head
Aroma is wheaty cloves and all white doaves
Flavour is lightly spiced buns"
Weissbier Hell,4.02,"I would love to taste this beer fresh.

Poured from a bottle into a tall tulip glass. Hazy orangish yellow color with excellent head and curtain lacing. Smell of lemon and grass. Taste of the same with orange, honey, spices. I want to try it again."
Weissbier Hell,4.69,"Love this weiss beer from Andechs, even a bit more than Weinstephaner. The beer pours a nice orange blossom color, good head for the style, really nice aroma of cloves, banana. The taste is just great, everything you anticipate from what you get in the nose comes out in the taste. It is a tiny bit more medium bodied than Weinstephaner and hangs in there just a bit longer where Weinstephaner gets a bit watery as it settles. This is an awesome weiss beer worth coming back to in any season, but especially summer. The dunkelweiss is also terrific."
Weissbier Hell,3.84,"Taste: crisp, banana, cloves, wheat bread, barley malt also. Same with the nose. Golden hue, hazy, refined head and some lace. Medium body. A nice hybrid of to styles."
Weissbier Hell,4.25,"I skunked my last bottle by accident last review. I'm overwriting the old review with this new one. Take care of your bottles, leave them cold and dark until you're ready to open them up and pour them. This is especially true for bottle conditioned. I believe 100% of Andechs is bottle conditioned.

L: Hazy deep straw yellow. It is bottle conditioned, hazy and residual, and the regular rules for storage apply. It looks really great, I can hardly recall the last time I saw head so fine.

S: Wheat beer. Lots of banana, clove, and tangy yeast.

T: This may be the best traditional hefeweizen I've ever had. It's very lively, bubbly, and fun. It makes Blue Moon Light Sky look like a joke for starters. I wish I could go into more detail, but for now let me say you should pick up at least 10 bottles to get started.

F: Smooth and light. Supremely drinkable.

O: It's very nice."
Weissbier Hell,4.49,"Pours hazy to the point of being opaque, varying shades of yellow from bright, almost neon to pale straw and dark golden. Huge billowing bright white head with excellent retention and lots of lacing. Aroma is tons fruity esters, huge banana; great phenolic spice to balance with big clove and some cracked white pepper. Near perfect aroma for a hefe. Taste follows, albeit a little more subdued than the aroma. There is nice banana, a subtly pleasant vanilla like character that I almost never get from hefes or beers in general. Spice is there but it’s more pepper forward and less clove than the nose, although the clove is there. Another spice I can’t quite place, maybe cardamom-esque. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, it’s easier drinking than many hefes which I often find very filling. Overall, this excellent. Amongst the best hefes Ove ever had. Well deserving of its place on the Beers of Fame list.

Weissbier Hell,4.25,"16.9oz Bomber poured into a Weizen glass

Fizzy, fluffy off white foam cap reduced to a pencil thick layer over an apricot colored translucent liquid with active streams of carbonation

Aroma is banana, clove, fresh cut sweet grass

Taste is cloves, banana

Sudsy, frothy mouthfeel , almost creamy, quaffable

Great summer refreshing beer

“ A Weissbier that embodies a slice of the Andechs lifestyle: finely yeasty, tangy, and sparkling, it refreshes and renews the thirst for more”"
Weissbier Hell,4.25,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle. Pours darkish yellow with decent foam. Tastes of subtle banana and light spices (anise seed, perhaps). Very smooth. Nicely done. Great for the style."
Weissbier Hell,4.25,"Such a perfect representation of the style! Yeasty, cloudy deep golden color with a pillowy bright white head. The mouthfeel is extraordinary--silky smooth, almost creamy. The yeast does all the right flavorful things: cloves, banana as the subtle bite of wheat balances everything out. Delicious!"
Weissbier Hell,4.28,"Look: A cloudy pale yellow on the pour with an awesome, pure white, billowing head that pillows up and ever-so-slowly recedes, leaving sticky lacing behind
Aroma: Bananas, freshly baked wheat bread, clove, wafts of honey, yeast, and the occasional bubblegum note
Taste: Cloves, honey, and wheat bread combine forces and lead the initial charge as esters of banana weave in and out of the picture. The clove note almost gains strength and carries throughout the middle before wheat bread and bananas, along with bubblegum, close it out
Mouthfeel: Full, very soft throughout – silky almost, medium-high carbonation, and a nice, soft finish
Overall: This is tasty stuff. A delicious and well-made Weissbier that hits all of the right note for me and in my opinion, is borderline flawless in execution. Soft and silky but not chewy on the feel helps round out my thoughts on its success a well. I have drunk previously and will drink this again and would recommend it for anyone looking for a good Weissbier"
Weissbier Hell,4.39,"Pours hazy, gold in color with one inch head. Taste is banana, clove and wheat. Light bodied, sweet with moderate carbonation. Excellent and clean German lager. Will gladly pick up again."
Weissbier Hell,4.52,"Review 1522

My quest for the famed 250, continues with this German beer. The beer is 42 degrees and served in Heffe glass. The pour of the beer created a massive three-fingered head with excellent retention. The bright white foamy and creamy left massive lacing on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The beer's color is SRM 4, pale straw with light golden hues. The hazy beer is typical for this style of beer. This beer looks amazing.

I get ripe bananas, cloves, and wheat for my first smell. Nosing further, I detect toasted bread, malty sweetness, and a touch of floral.

The flavors are bananas, wheat, cloves, bread crust, malty sweetness, and a hint of floral with a smidge of phenols.

The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.

The body of the beer is medium, medium carbonation, and medium finish.

This beer is tasty. The flavor profile is simple, elegant, and masterfully crafted. I do taste a bit of age on the beer but that is expected considering it is from Germany. The flavors of the beer are near perfect for this style. Yet again, I would enjoy a few more of these beers in the fridge for a beautiful summer night by a fire."
Weissbier Hell,4.24,"Look: So prone to forming a head that I had to wait a few minutes after a pour to figure out its ""natural"" look because almost the entire glass was foam. It roughly settles on a cloudy yellow body with slightly over 4 fingers of foamy white head that seem incapable of dissipating.

Smell: Bananas, sweet wheat malt, cloves.

Taste: Sweet wheat malt with a hint of the rest of the scent, transforming into orange and lemon peel and cloves. No noticeable hop bitterness. Clean and sweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, with good carbonation.

Overall: This might be the platonic ideal of the hefeweizen. It tastes like the exact version of this beer that anybody would want to use as its gold standard. Is it the best beer? No. Is it the most hefe-tasting hefe? God yes."
Weissbier Hell,4.52,"Look: nice golden white with a thick white head

Smell: banana, malt, and wheat

Taste: banana, wheat, and malt.

Feel: super smooth, just the right amount of carbonation"
Weissbier Hell,3.9,"July 30th, 2016 - A Donkey Kong's country worth of banana mushroom clouds out of the glass, like a melted Laffy Taffy, but not too sweet. The smell is almost chewy, and causes salivation with a heavy glaze of butterscotch, sage and rosemary. The gourmet aroma leads to a semi-foamy body, and a clear taste of banana mixed with fresh cut cedar. A delicious and unique combination."
Weissbier Hell,4.25,"Pours a cloudy golden amber color. Moderate to large foam head retains well.

The fruity nose especially highlights banana, along with citrus zest. Spicy aromas of cloves interact with bready wheat malts.

The taste is bright and tangy with notes of orange peel supporting flavors of sweet banana, wheat and slightly doughy and bready malt. The clove like spices are aptly applied for balance, not too overpowering. The finish is tangy and smooth.

Medium bodied with a smooth and soft mouthfeel. The softness of the mouthfeel is contrasted with the lively carbonation.

One of the better Hefeweizens I’ve had. Authentic and on par with the style. Very nice."
Weissbier Hell,4.47,"Really really nice Hefeweizen..

All of the standards are met both in aroma and flavor...banana, yeast, clove...

Extremely satisfying... the Germans have the lager game dominated...

Will purchase regularly...new to my market and can't wait for warmer weather so I can enjoy by the pool"
Weissbier Hell,4.32,"The appearance is the weakest part of this beer. Does not have the bright beer look that I associate with hefeweizens. Aroma of bananas, wheat, and cloves. There is a flavor quality that this beer possesses that American varieties of this style just cannot duplicate. Must be a combination of the water profile and the yeast they use. It is different from any other German hefes as well. The flavor borders on citrus and melon. Very solid body and carbonation. Very drinkable and rewarding hefeweizen."
Celebration,4.56,Really good beer
Celebration,4.47,An annual pleasure. The best part for me is the fresh hop smell the you open one.
Celebration,3.75,"2021 edition. Can into pint glass. Canned 10/12/2021.

L: golden red, moderate to large head
S: Loads of fresh hops, though less now that the can is a couple of months old.
T: Mostly hop bitterness, maybe a little malt sweetness
F: This year's edition is smooth and very crushable.
O: It's a solid IPA and worth the purchase every year when it drops. 2021 was an especially good year for it. It doesn't quite live up to the hype for my taste though."
Celebration,4.08,"Good look and medium/heavy feel. I was hoping the taste would be 50/50 hop malt but definitely hop forward probably 75/25 hop to malt. Not my thing but I see why it’s rated so highly.

Edit: couple hours and a few more brews later and this grew on me. Def not my first choice but dang it’s good."
Celebration,3.56,had 2021 version / of all the years i've had of their winter beer this is the mildest not much sp[ice flavor enjoyable but expected more
Celebration,4.25,"Lives up to the reputation every year, deep amber orange with lively bubbles, khaki head that lives on, and leaves lacing for the duration of the glass, with hoppy piney citrusy aromas from hop heaven....taste follows the introduction perfectly, with a malt body that balances the hops; such a classic full flavored, balanced ale- this is rich and very well made, obviously. get some when you see it"
Celebration,2.82,"I had to look twice after tasting it to see the freshness date.
Maybe I bought a bad batch, but I wouldn't buy it again."
Celebration,3.94,"Canned 10/12/21 and poured into a Sam Adams glass

L: Slightly hazy black tea color. Off white head with good retention.
S: Orange peel, caramel malt.
T: Taste is much bolder than the smell. Strong hop bitterness balanced by malt sweetness.
F: Medium bodied. Sticky, bitter finish.
O: An old school IPA from a brewery that doesn’t make bad beer."
Celebration,4.75,"Not much to add that hasn't already been said. If you're looking for a true celebration of hops, this is the one to search for. Just enough bite from the hops, just enough grain to smooth, and just enough sweetness to complete the package. As close as an American IPA comes, to excellence in balance. As far as I'm concerned, this drink sets the bar to judge other IPAs."
Celebration,4.25,"Great looking brew on the pour -- red hue and a big pillowy head and thick rings of lace. Aroma is very hoppy and slightly dank. Taste is complex -- bitter, hoppy resin start with malty middle with some citrus sweet mixed in. Dry, slightly bready finish and bitterness wanes a bit as it warms in the glass. This is a really nice holiday brew that most hop heads and IPA lovers will like. ABV is what you would expect, but it isn't boozy. A well-crafted American IPA."
Celebration,4,"Poured from a 12oz can
On the pour the color is dark for an IPA, almost red, but still in the amber range decent head looks frothy with some bigger bubbles, fair retention. Very light lacing that doesnt love to stick around.

The smell hits as soon as you start pouring. Strong piny hops are strong in this one, definitely a wesr coast/traditional american feel on the nose. Malt is largely overshadowed in the smell, but on the back there is a hint of resinous citrus.

Taste is very strong and a classic bitter american IPA but the hop nuance still shines through beyond the bitter. The malt is much more present in flavor and imparts an amber malty sweetness carrying it along nicely. As a malt head myself I appreciate that. The alcohol is detectable bit not in a boozy way per se, more in addition to the hoppy bitterness. The bitterness does tend to stick around for a bit after a sip.

The feel is quite heavy I must say but it certainly warms you up as it should, as a winter seasonal. I can see this being a favorite for the ipa crowd for sure.

Overall a bit hoopy for my taste but I could see that coming, however the hop flavors are of very high quality and the piny hops are a nice touch for an interesting take on seasonal holiday beers."
Celebration,4.07,"A perfectly poured pint from the tap in the Pine Room.

Well done winter release from Sierra. Hoppy but not too hoppy, Bitter,but no too bitter, and an ABV that gets the job done without leaving a mark.

A really good IPA perfect for the holidays with family or friends.

Per the rules...kinda cloudy kinda not, smells like you'd expect, a nice fore shadowing before the beer hits your mouth...mouthfeel? Not too thin or creamy....a beer as you would expect a beer to feel."
Celebration,4.36,"2021 Review
Canned: 10/06/21

L: Pours a light amber with a big, white head that thang hangs out for a while. A good amount of lacing sticks around for the whole can.

S: Grapefruit, pine, malt, and sweet orange. .

T: Grapefruit, pine resin, good malt sweetness, and a nice bitter finish. Bitter orange lingers well after the swallow.

F: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit sticky followed by bitter hop. It calls for a second sip.

O: Old school IPA. Great citrus-forward hop profile with a solid malt body. The prickly, lively carbonation dances on your tongue and helps dry out the heavy malt. The alcohol heat is just right and seems to kick in right at the end of the beer."
Celebration,4.42,"Canned 10/12/21; drank 11/22/21 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dark orange appearance.

A rough pour yielded a huge khaki head; frothy, tree-rung lace.

Strawberry, orange peel, fresh soap & faint pine notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Fruit punch, dry pine, mild caramel & faint fresh soap flavors.

Balanced but still very hop forward. I was blown away. This is a classic for a reason."
Celebration,4.33,"Cloudy copper amber color with a finger of white head. The nose is sticky pine sap, orange peel, with caramel ever present in the background. The first taste is pithy grapefruit, followed by a shot of resinous bitter. There is also a sweetness almost like the corn sweetness in bourbon. The finish is apple pie spice and a lingering bitter that hangs around awhile. The finish is good and dry and a bit creamy. Everything here plays so well together...no rough edges, nothing overpowers, just smooth transitions. Ahhhh..."
Celebration,4.4,"Poured a 12-oz can, bottled a month ago, in my Spiegelau IPA glass. Big firm head a light shade of brown, slightly hazy brew brownish orange, SRM color 12.
Not much smell through the head, but as head subsides slowly, I get good grassy fresh hop aroma.
Tastes real good, with a blossoming aftertaste revealing gentle bitter hanging on nicely and a mouth-watering need for more.
Carbonation is just right, mouthfeel rich but clear and crisp; lacing beautiful, gladness results.
Definitely a fine IPA to keep in the fridge!"
Black Albert,4.16,"Poured into the test glass, from 11.2 oz bottle with ""BA No. 14 BRS Brew"" on the label.
A - Chalkboard black, with a thin off white ring of assembled bubbles, a slow moving archipelago in the center of the ring.
S - Burnt brown sugar, cigar wrap tobacco drying in the barn, dark cocoa, hint of soy, and anise.
T - Black pepper corn, bakers chocolate, again a hint of tobacco, with dark fruits being the center, fig, dried plum, with again hint of anise.
M - Medium bordering to to heavy in body, full palate coating while avoiding the ""syruppy"" trap, Start is semi sweet, with lingering bitterness acting as the clean up agent, Finish is just dry enough to invite another sip.
O - A lovely sipper, excellent RIS characteristics, with rich complex flavors, well hidden alcohol, and luxurious texture."
Black Albert,4.7,"From a bottle 08/2022 at Brick Store, Decatur, Ga. Wonderful aroma, could've just taken in the aroma and not even drank any of it and wouldv'e been great. But the powerful complex array of flavors combined with unbeatable mouthfeel for an imperial stoudt put it over the top"
Black Albert,4.5,"2015 Vintage

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and rocky finger of dark tan head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, anise, raisins, and espresso
T: Taste is dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, hints of oxidation, some slight smoke and charred wood with a hint of burnt sugars. On the swallow there's some sweetness along with more coffee, chocolate, charred wood and burnt sugar
M: This beer is thick and velvety on the palate. Carbonation is low, but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish from the high ABV.
O: Overall this is a really well done Russian Imperial Stout. It has good flavors and a nice amount of complexity. It may have lost a step at this age but it's still drinking very well."

Black Albert,4.01,"#1696 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Jet-black to the eye, pours with brief 2mm dark tan head, soon a scattered patch, unsurprising given the ABV%
S- Like cold Brit Xmas pudding condensed into a liquid, deeply fruity and pungent, plus molasses notes.
T- Wow, a deep brewed fruity thickness and pungency. Then a blazing shaft of lightly sour + mega-ABV% that makes me involuntarily physically shudder, thankfully briefly. Jeez gawds this thing is intense. I'm getting like ultra-deep concentrated prune juice notes -> back to the molasses in the smell.
F- It's mega deep, rich/complex, yet also notably has a sour aspect too.
O- Good grief, what is this thing!? The ABV isn't *that* high but this THING is an absolute beast. Yes it's interesting, and a heck of a statement, but I don't think I really need 330ml of it - it would be a lot more interesting if I had a couple of buddies over and could share, 110ml each, pre a session of other less slaying brews. Interesting to try, but to me it's one of those huge one off statements you experience but wouldn't buy again; this is simply not a 'normal beer'. Oh and for context, it is 1000% the complete antithesis of a session beer. The ABV% isn't even *that* high, as any Icelandic beer-head will attest...
It's one of those beers that is so different and really hard to know how to rate. Mega flavour/mega naked and shouty ABV%, complete blaster on the palate. Quite probably the most intense beer I've ever had (that is not, of course, a clear compliment). Is this aged in wine casks? That might be the sour note...
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! ==> Unfilt, unpast. Bot-Con. That's all.
Does it in fact taste like beer? as I get to the lower 1/4 glass it strikes me more like a noxious dry fortified wine. I'm laching stout notes and certainly more usual Russian Imp Stout notes....

Black Albert,4.07,"Lot B6BB - June 2007
From Premier Gourmet in Pittsfield, MA

Flat as a brick. Chocolate, pepper, tobacco on the nose. Unique, almost herbal flavor. Nice!"
Black Albert,4.35,"Pours jet black, without much head. Does not at all feel like a 13% ABV. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, nice body, and a very pleasant cocoa aftertaste. One of the best, not only from De Struise, but also in its class."
Black Albert,4.47,"Last RIS in the cellar until fall. Totally black with a small tan head that had a crimson edge. Lacing was sparse. Vinous aroma of ripe fruit, dark chocolate, anise and molasses. Complex flavors of dark fruit, strong coffee and semi-sweet chocolate mingle with licorice, smoke and toffee. Hops stay hidden in the background; carbonation stays low; alcohol stays approachable. Like a fortified wine, best sipped instead of gulped."
Black Albert,4.5,"an extraordinary brew, one of the best of its kind, 2015 vintage here, patiently cellared, something special! the level of refinement here is off the charts, and this was even better than expected. a strong stout with a little belgian flair and a ton of well matured complexity. its matte black in the glass, leggy and holding over half an inch of deep mocha froth, really pretty brew, soft looking for its obvious enormity. aroma of burnt coffee, sweeter caramel and toffee in the center, licorice, sweet chocolate, tobacco, and anise, a little alcohol warmth too, a light yeast ester interestingly enough, and a concentrated character, just a dab of flattering oxidation. the flavor is incredibly complex, with a really well layered malt base happening, charcoal and earthy minerals, coal and iron and things of that nature to me, raisin and espresso, baking chocolate, fresh cigar, pipe tobacco, molasses, and again a cool yeast thats both english and bready and kind of belgian to me, lightly peppery even, and really does a nice job of drying this out. the alcohol isnt as intense as it smells, and this drinks almost dangerously smooth and mellow for how big it is, im sure the age helps with that. just wonderful depth to this, smooth and round in feel, weighty but not tiring, and just really unique to me. an incredible beer from a brewery i love, i wish more of their beers came around. this is stunning, as good as it gets!"
Black Albert,4.41,"Vintage 2016.
Petroleum black color with a thin head with a caramel head.
Intense aroma with notes of black fruits, coffee, umami, grapefruit, cocoa, plums and molasses.
Flavor with notes of cocoa, roasted coffee beans, plums, oak, local hops, grapefruit, molasses, tons of spices, licorice, sour cherries and a bit of charcoal. Dry aftertaste with a decent bitterness.
Full body with perfect carbonation. Alcohol of 13% is superbly disguised.
What a superb beer. Intense notes of spices, dark fruits, local hops and with a roasted character mingle perfect together."
Black Albert,4.29,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and notes of chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, licorice and hints of tobacco. Taste is a an excellent balance of quite roasted, caramel malt, brown sugar, chocolate and dark fruits, with notes of raisin and fig, lighter coffee, licorice, tobacco and leather, as well as just a hint of vanilla and clove also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit and licorice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

This makes for quite a rich and complex Imperial Stout with a great balance of sweet, fruity and roasted, spicy notes, with the caramel malt, brown sugar and dark fruit being rather distinct here, but being balanced by equally distinct roasted malt, licorice and spice, while the tobacco, leather and hints of bitter, earthy hops really add to the richness of character here. Very nice, full mouthfeel as well, while the ABV really is hardly noticeably here, indeed making this dangerously drinkable for 13%. Comparing this rather fresh bottle to a much older bottle I had a while ago, I'm not sure how well this ages, as I've enjoyed this one a lot more than my older review would suggest, although external factors may be at play here."
Black Albert,4.13,"Poured a black body with minimal tan head and lace ring down glass. Aroma has notes of mildly roasted coffee along with something like dark, bitter fudge chocolate. Smooth, creamy, hides the booze well, more of a warming bitter chocolate sweetness then overtly dry or roasted; easy to sip and dangerous too."
Black Albert,4.23,"No. 14 - 2015 vintage. Bottle appears a bit worse for wear - yellowing paper, a bit torn. Carbonation is very mild even poured hard. Decidedly Belgian yeast presence. A bit of a chocolate, light hoppiness still, bitter coffee roast. Some vanilla peeking through as well. Mildly ashy and dry in the finish. Occasionally and unpredictably boozy. Reasonably thick body, but taste thins significantly as it warms.

Unique and memorable. Not a favorite, but this is a terrific beer all the same."
Black Albert,4.86,"I've had this on tap in Belgium, in a bottle I bought there and brought home and from a bottle purchased in the States. On tap it's the best food product I've ever had, unbelievable texture, depth, mouthfeel, and richness. Inefable, really, so trying to describe it can only fail.

Out of a bottle you've handled with care it's almost as startling. A bottle you buy in a retail store is a toss up, might be a magical experience and might be so-so, depending on the conditions it's been subject to, and its age. However, if you see it buy it! Even somewhat mishandled it's at 4.0+. A reasonably fresh bottle that's had a good trip is 4.8+.

Really, this is the ne plus ultra of beer, and you don't have to be a Belgium beer fan."
Black Albert,4.13,"330ml bottle from Struise Bottleshop, Bruges (€5):
Strong & thick, this one was a beer I really had to take my time with given the alcohol content & how boozy & warming it was at times. It opened with some nice chocolate & bitter coffee flavours that were complimented by a vanilla sweetness & some sugars further on but it definitely wasn't a beer to rush. It seemed a little too strong at times, particularly early on but it was complex & rich with some pleasant dark malts & dark fruits showing too."
Torpedo Extra IPA,5,"Excellent, and..... no surprise....it ranks high because it's an ipa. Go figure. Peeps who love this need to stop rating adjunct lagers. Just stay in your lane."
Torpedo Extra IPA,3.9,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 6/07/2022 into a Willi Becher pint glass.
L - Pours a dark amber color with a medium white head that dissipates quickly leaving lacing n the glass.
S - Smells malty.
T - Tastes malty and citrusy with a nice bitterness.
F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Drinks like a tasty West Coast IPA."
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.04,"The middle ground of a normal ipa and double ipa. Bitter, citrusy resinous. Really nice carbonation and finish isn’t overly sweet."
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.34,Poured into a 16 oz pint glass; no birth date. Pours amber yellow with two fingers worth of head; nice lacing throughout. Tastes of subtle citrus and pine with bitter hops; great malt backing. A solid beer that's done really well. Enjoy.
Torpedo Extra IPA,3.68,May-22
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.25,"L: Frothy& thick off-white head, orange/ amber cloudy appearance with fine bubble rising up and a few sediments.
S: citrus (grapefruit), piney, raw mango and bread.
T: Taste matches the smell, barley malt, citrusy bitterness and ale like sweetness, mild herby spice.
F: Medium and fluffy body with a dry finish.

Delicious and excellent product!

7.2 ABV | 65 IBU"
Torpedo Extra IPA,3.5,"Sierra Nevada and hops go hand in hand. What began as a crazy idea scribbled in a pub eventually became our newest year-round hop bomb, Torpedo Extra IPA. The first beer to feature our “Hop Torpedo”—a revolutionary dry-hopping device that controls how much hop aroma is imparted into beer without adding additional bitterness. Torpedo Extra IPA is an aggressive yet balanced beer with massive hop aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.

Lækker potent IPA, den er kraftig, men med en god balance. Den har en aroma af pine og citrus. God fyldig øl til den mørkegyldne side"
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.5,"Pours a nice dark gold to copper with an off-white finger of head that reduces to something like a bubble sea with some larger bubbles forming islands that stick around, leaving some nice lacing.
Smells of pine and citrus with a nice bready aroma hidden underneath
Taste follows the smell; quite nicely balanced hop-malt ratio... Resinous, slightly sweet, moderately bitter.
Mouth feel is medium-full; slightly above average carbonation. Alcohol is there but not overwhelming.
Overall a nice brew, but seems to be hit or miss at my location in Texas. Possibly temperature issues affecting some batches here earlier this year, but this current case dated 4//7/22 is definitely on point."
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.4,"Excellent IPA. Not quite as hoppy as the Hazy Little thing, but a tasty, high-alcohol brew. Usually found in bottles, not cans. Hooray for that!"
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.04,"Look: Nearly clear rich red in color with a dense and quick-forming off-white head that holds as a pillow, slowly settling and leaving behind nice lacing
Aroma: Oranges, grapefruit, pine, fresh baked bread, limes, fir needles, and the prototypical Sierra Nevada yeast phenolics
Taste: A rush of citrus fruit and rind start it off and start to mingle as layers of bready malt slowly filter in and join. Pine and fir flex some once the citrus subsides and closes with citrus rejoining the coniferous notes along with a big hop bite in tow
Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic and delicious WCIPA that drinks like its name as an ‘Extra IPA’ – bigger than an IPA but not quite in full-blown DIPA territory. Lots of citrus and conifer hop notes on top of an ample malt backbone and a welcome bite and medium dry finish. I haven’t had this in a bit but will now make a point to keep it in the regular rotation"
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.71,"When I think of ""the IPA beer,"" this is in my top 3, a bold taste that leave me not wanting."
Torpedo Extra IPA,4.52,Hard to find a widely-available west coast IPA that's better than this.
Palo Santo Marron,4.66,"This is a very creative beer. Rich in flavor, slight cherry (sour), caramel, figs, and vanilla."
Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"Im sampling this 12 oz bottle at cellar temp poured into my snifter. This bottle is about 7 years old and has been in my cellar for most of its life. The beer pours black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. Very minimal tan head foams up and remains a thin edge layer throughout sampling. I leave maybe a ml in the bottle as there are some sediment chunks that Im not interested in.
The aroma is rich and complex malt profile. I get brown sugar, some vanilla, and rich woody notes. I also get a little booze and hints of port in the background. I also do get just a wisp of oxidation cardboard buried. glad I opened now and not next year!
First sip reveals a medium body with mild yet still slightly tingly carbonation. Texture is definitely sticky and coats my lips and palate with each sip. Flavor is deep malt with brown sugar, some tobacco, dark cocoa powder, and wood. Finish actually also has a little dark fruit and some booze. No hop character anywhere and I dont get any oxidation on the flavor profile. I do find this to be a sipping beer due to the texture and slight booziness on the finish. Interesting and enjoyable, but I need to go back and get a fresh bottle to remind myself of what it tastes like without aging."
Palo Santo Marron,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark, dark brown pour... nearly black with a finger of off-white head.

S: Rich and roasty... wood, smoke, oak, and toasted grains.

T.F: Just like it smells. Rich and semi-sweet. Strong oak and wood. Spice, a bit of smoke, earth, and toasted grains. Aromatics... vanilla, spice, coffee, and cocoa. Medium bodied... smooth and creamy. Warming... ABV hidden.

O: An outstanding Imperial Brown ale... great flavor, and it really picks up the wood/smoke/aromatics. Hides its hefty ABV... unique and delicious stuff."
Palo Santo Marron,3.98,"Cask at the GBBF 2008, gravity dispense. Black colour, no head. Alcoholic but interesting aroma and flavour, notes of ""oak"" (actually palo santo wood), coffee and fortified wine. At 12% ABV this is powerful stuff. Good, but not easy drinking."
Palo Santo Marron,4.64,"L: Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color, with a thin espresso colored head; has strong legs on the side of the glass.
S: Boozy, vanilla, brown sugar, roasted, whisky barrel.
T: Taste very much follows the nice, has a nice coffee-like bitterness as well, oak, dark chocolate.
F: Full-bodied, light carbonation, chewy & heavy, yet smooth on the finish.
O: What is there even to complain about? A very well done brew, cheers!"
Palo Santo Marron,4.81,"Instead of the strict five point review format, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.

This beer is and in-depth, syrupy mouthful of deliciousness, especially when comparing it to your average pint of not-nearly-as-heavy brown ale. I bought a 4 pack of bottles on a trip (bottled 10/09/20, drinking it on 1/8 and drinking it at whatever appropriate temperature for this type of beer, fuck fussing about degrees F) and it's an excellent beer. Very little noticeable carbonation and all of those dank, roasty, delicious flavors I love in a brown ale whether exceptionally heavy or as light as newcastle.

For sure, worth an excellent review in my eyes"
Palo Santo Marron,4.44,"It smells like a sweet steaming loaf of decadent brown bread on some exotic wooden cutting board with a bottle of smokeless scotch opened just next to it.

It has the taste of a ball of dough rolled in rich and bitter cocoa nibs. Once that slightly fades you can taste some wood that a little alcohol has been spilled on.

It feels smooth like hot cocoa down to the fact that it warms your mouth with the high alcohol content. Mild carbonation prickles a little and when you swallow you're left with a dry and clean bitterness.

Overall it's really interesting. I like it and it's unique. I give it a 5.3 out of 6."
Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"Deep brown appearance with a large, dense, tan head and good lacing. Aroma is a mix of molasses, chocolate and vanilla extract over the wood. Sweet, roasted malt flavors along with some dark fruit. Hops take their time to clock in and you may have to wait a bit for them to register. Full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel. Lingering, sweet, slightly cloying finish. Alcohol was warming but approached the 12% in a stealthy fashion."
Palo Santo Marron,4.58,"$4.00, 12 fl oz., 12%ABV, Bottled on Oct. 9th 2020, 38.7ºF (3.7ºC) [gonna let it warm up a bit]

Overall: this is a delicious beer nothing more to say besides the score: 95"
Palo Santo Marron,4.86,"look: so brown it's block, a frothy, lively head

smell: one of the best parts. the palo santo marron wood of course gives it some woody scent (redwood? rosemary?), but also a very savory char. like a BBQ smoker

taste: soy sauce, barbecue sauce, salami, rosemary, thyme, sage. i can't get over how savory this is. i don't even get a ton of acutal oak or wood, it just tastes like someone stacked their smoker with some very tasty wood, and made a bunch of meat. it's not a campfire beer, it's a barbecue beer, in that it tastes like a whole meal

feel: not hot at all, thick and syrupy. minimal carbonation.

overall: special place in my heart. i love meal beers."
Palo Santo Marron,4.55,"A truly wonderful experience! I love brown ales and this is one of the best I've had. The worst thing is I live in Tennessee and that is a long way from Delaware. I love most of the Dogfish brews but find them difficult to get in my area, Way to go DFH! Keep up the good work."
Palo Santo Marron,4.36,"12 oz bottle poured into a lagunitas mason jar. Bottled date 4/12/19, drank on 9/9/20.

L - Dark Brown with a caramel colored head that lingers.
S - Hints of vanilla, not strong
T - Boozy and woody, notes of vanilla and caramel. Malt also comes through
F - Nice feel, somewhat thick and carbonated
O - One of the best brown ales I've ever had. Dogfish Head, you've done it again!"
Palo Santo Marron,3.9,"PSM is the embodiment of the wood aging process. This ale is boozy and full of woody dryness and strength. The flavors coming through include heavy vanilla and heavy caramel. A Truly unique experience and great for anyone that loves the deep wood profile.

IG: @firesidewithphil"
Palo Santo Marron,3.65,"Bottled in 2016 and opened in 2020 --- probably too long to wait, but it's 2020 so who knows what the standards are? Pours a dark black brown, little head or lacing, chocolate foam barely on the glass. Smells the rich, boozy tableau of a pastry stout. But the taste is where the aging went wrong. We veered past mellow and straight into deterioration and astringency. Ah, well. At least I'll have a headache tomorrow."
Palo Santo Marron,4.2,"Bottles 4/24/20

I actually set one of these aside in the cellar before drinking a freah one, pretty sure it’s a 2019 and I plan on drinking it next year for my college graduation

Pours a rich dark brown with a finger of khaki head that reduces to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, and light milk chocolate. Really just a touch of oak but nothing spectacular

The taste starts off charred, more roasty like a stout. Some intense vanilla and rich malt with dark roast coffee. The milk chocolate comes out on the finish

Quite the light feel for a brown but still full in flavor with moderate carbonation leads to a smooth and nearly dry finish

This was not exactly what I was expecting, I wanted my mind to be blown. I guess that ones on me, but I’ve heard it gets better with age. I’ll have to set aside other beers for graduation too, but this will be nice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the day has finally come. I graduated from college with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering earlier today (okay, yesterday really) and now it's time to whip out a bottle of this I've had for a while dated 4/12/19. Let's dive right in

Still looking the same in color but with a slightly bigger head and more lacing (3.75->4)

Holy hell, the wood in this older bottle is significantly more present. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25->4.5)

Honestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4->4)

The body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4->4.25)

Overall this has to go (4->4.25). This definitely impressed me more than it did initially, but I think setting another bottle aside would be fun to see how the taste evolves"
Palo Santo Marron,4.72,"Pours deep copper with a 1/4 inch wispy, tan head. Light lacing.

Aroma of molasses, oak, coffee, toffee, vanilla.

Taste follows nose: Molasses, coffee, oak, vanilla.

Full bodied, light carbonation. Semi-sweet, oily finish.

Wow! This is one of Dogfish's best."
Palo Santo Marron,3.83,"Very dark, appealing brown ale. Almost totally opaque like a stout. Smells great! Smokey, roasted caramel scent with some vanilla aromas. Very flavorful, complex brew, but it's a little too sweet. It feels a little syrupy and thick, unfortunately. It's a great beer for someone who has been dabbling in the waters of craft brewing and enjoys darker, sweeter beers!"
Palo Santo Marron,4.13,"This brewery, they do as they please, because they’re established and have the following to do so. I personally commend them for making beer that nobody else would. With that being said sometimes it’s too over the top and that’s the case with this brown ale. I’ve never seen a Brown Ale with such a high ABV. It’s too over powering and doesn’t drink like any brown ale I’ve had. Honestly if they toned this down a bit , could be a really amazing brown. Worth a try but not high on my repeat list."
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.1,"16 oz draft pour. Pours a light amber/yellow color with an off-white head. Aroma and flavor feature juicy citrus, a medium and slightly sweet malt backbone, and moderate bitterness. It's easy to drink and I preferred it to the Surly Furious I drank before."
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.28,"My go to for a lower abv and lower bitterness ipa. I say that relative terms, as it still bright and bitter plenty of abv but toned down enough to make my go to for that reasonable ipa that is high quality. The best in the aforementioned categories and availability. I got at it meijer in ohio.
Cheers."
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.48,"Epic beer is epic! It appears to be mellow at first, but the smell and flavor blast you off to a pineapple/mango heaven w/ a hint of orange zest! It has sippability and chuggability!"
Fresh Squeezed IPA,3.87,"This is a 120z. bottle poured into the Deschutes pint glass. This ale is slightly hazy, leaning to the orange color, there is a thick two finger off white thick head. This cap never fades away, it has only settled a finger. The carbonation is noticeable and with a steady parade of small bubbles ascending.
The aroma is your typical IPA , citrus and pine, very noticeable.
Fruity upfront, sweet, then the hoppy, crisp, bitter finish.
The mouthfeel is medium, with the hops giving it a somewhat dry finish.
To me this is a very good IPA, sweet fruit, juicy, slightly bitter, but not over the top."
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.14,"Look: Amber honey like color 1 finger sightly off-white head.

Smell: sweet aromas of citrus, mango, pine.

Taste: Sweet beginnings with mellow flavors of mango, lime, lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, pine and a dry, nice and bitter mouthfeel.

I little disappointed by the amount of hop presence.

IBU: 60 IBV: 6.4%"
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.63,One of the best IPAs…sooo good. Smooth.
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.58,An excellent IPA that packs a punch ABV-wise (in a good way). Pours a nice hazy dark amber with a lingering head. Smells of hops and light citrus. Taste is not super bitter and definitely juicy.
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.71,"Very drinkable. I’m not a fan of IPAs that feel thick enough to bite. This one was smooth without being watery- good balance. Good flavor. Well done.

My first Deschutes brew. Will try more."
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.3,Delicious and lots of hops. Pours with huge head (4 fingers) that leaves tons of lacing. Lots of hops aroma and flavor finishing into mango. Silky and almost creamy mouthfeel. Just a bit lacking on bitterness to throw off the balance. Very very good overall though.
Fresh Squeezed IPA,5,I have tried this beer on tap at deschutes brewery in Portland it’s was what your would expect from a world class IPA amazing brown amber color with crisp floral flavors of multiple hops loved it! Cheers!
Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.24,"12oz can, tulip, canned 10/5/21.

Red skewed amber with a crackly, generous papyrus colored head and even some nice lace.

Juicy grape, mango, and peach rings. Vibrant, and again, very juicy.

The peach rings and gummy candy come out strong. There’s a malt backbone with an English character, which is something I haven’t tasted in a hot minute. The bitterness is smooth, medium, and finishes cleanly.

A medium-light body and creamy carbonation combine for a really put together beer.

I thought I’d had this before and that it wasn’t memorable, but now I’m not so sure. This is a really nice combination of new hops and throwback to English pale ales and early American craft."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,3.55,"Big 750ML bottle that’ll make quite a crash in the recycling bin. Split with my wife. Because I’ve had my sugar quota for the week.

Lab black, little to no head. Smell like an Oompa Loompa is holding my face inches from a small pond of chocolate. Overwhelming.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout is sweeter than my Grandma (no, not really, nothing sweeter than Gen! Plus, she made killer buns). Wow. The cocoa. And this from a confirmed chocolate addict. All the chocolates. Vanilla shows after a good spell of warming along with a smidge of coconut. No toast. Nothing to offset the ridiculous sweetness. Full, big, but a small sample of this would have left me content. 75 minutes in & not half done.

The barrel aged version was superior: the bourbon & oak seem to have cut the overwhelming sense of being trapped in a silo of raw sugar. Good but would be much better in small quantities."
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.9,"Review #63, chocolate cake delight"
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.28,"It’s good. A little thinner than I’d like tbh. However, the cake flavor is there. It’s a tasty beer, just wish it was more full bodied."
Lunch,4.5,Pours a slightly hazy yellow. Thin foam. Light fruity hop aroma. Different than I expected. Good clean hop body. A little buttery. Fades to a nice pronounced malt profile. Easy transition. Finishes slightly bitter. Great from start to finish. I'd have this for lunch any day.
Lunch,3.95,"Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, frothy white head with very good retention.

Aroma: Tropical fruit and berry. Not aromas we quite muted, got no citrus or pine.

Flavor: Hop forward, flavor follows aroma. Moderate bitterness

Mouth feel: Medium body, creamy smooth.

Overall: I was actually a little disappointed, but this sample was about 3 months old. Aromas and flavors were more muted than I expected. I got berry and tropical fruit but very little citrus and no pine per the description. It can be hard to find Maine Beer Co in my area that is less than 60 days old unless you just get lucky. While it did not live up to the hype, I enjoyed this more than most IPA's because the bitterness balanced sweetness well, didn't overwhelm and destroy the palate. It has a nice creamy, smooth mouth-feel. 7% abv is very well hidden, would not know it is that high. Enjoyable beer, but was very overpriced for what I got. Based on price/enjoyment I would not purchase again simply because it is expensive."
Lunch,4.24,"16.9 oz bottle dated 5/22/22. Poured into a pint glass, fridge temp.
Orange gold, short fluffy white head.
Fresh green piney hop smell with grapefruit and citrus notes.
Taste is of an IPA fresh poured at a local brewery. Not too bitter, not sweet, not funky, but a familiar dank is present.
Feel is on the light side of medium, smooth, medium bubbles.
Overall, good fresh beer, price point is OK, this is a simple and unpretentious glass of good."
Lunch,4.43,"An easy pour from a 1 Pint .9FL. OZ. bottle released a fat finger of creamy white foam with long retention and thin rings of lacing. Translucent dark yellow straw color appears golden in bright light.

Citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine greets the nose, toast and cracker in the background. Somewhat dank, hints at being sweet.

Semi-dry with medium-high bitterness, malty and juicy-but not too juicy. Lemon and grass are added to the hop profile, a Kolsch-like wine and grape flavor emerges. A hint of caramel and toasted grain joins the malt. The finish is fast with malt and juice flavor dropping off, citrus and piney hops with a peppery bite linger a while.

Medium light bodied with ample carbonation, boldly flavored yet balanced and smooth. Alcohol is cleverly hidden.
True to style with clean and fresh taste. Born on date 31MAY22, 69 days old."
Lunch,4.36,From a bottle born on 7/19/22. Translucent orange with a half inch of fluffy white head. Grapefruit and floral hop smell. Medium body. Lightly toasted grain with some citrus and a floral/peppery finish. Very nice.
Lunch,4.15,"This is a good beer and I adore Maine beers in general. Truth be told I think Portland has a dozen beers better than Lunch, so I think it is slightly overrated, but that said it is definitely quality so give it a try."
Lunch,4.2,"500ml bottle, about a month old

Pours two massive fingers of fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is pretty good, and half a finger of head remains after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks pretty nice. Body is a hazy orange, with a hefty amount of bubbles coming up. Looks pretty good so far.

Nose is pretty tame - citrus rind, mandarin oranges, some sweetness. The orange comes out a little more with heavy agitation. Smells good enough.

The flavor is not much different. Light citrus, some orange.

That said, the mouthfeel completely transforms this beer. Carbonation is on the higher side. Body is somewhat light - drinks much lighter than 7%. A very small touch of sweetness; finishes very clean. Bitterness is medium. This is crisp, wet, and incredibly refreshing. Outstanding mouthfeel.

Drinkability is off the charts good.

Appearance turned out pretty nice. Lacing was cohesive for the most part, and some foam hung around to the bottom.

This feels like a pale ale that got crossed between the east and west coast. Has the look of an east coast, crispness of a west coast, and weight of a pale. On its own, the flavor is ok, but the mouthfeel really accentuates and elevates that. Very nice beer."
Lunch,4.46,"From the bottle's neck, it smells like an IPA but more nuanced. Like hoppy bubble gum. Pours a bright amber color with a large, long, retainful off-white head.
Very smooth, hoppy, malty, and refreshing. Candied hops and sweet malts. Occasionally bitter resin notes come out and are soon overridden by its general smoothness. The tropical notes take a bit more of a back seat, but they're there, particularly with some orange rind, melon, with the addition of some slightly herbal or peppery notes. Well carbonated till the end. The only thing I can compare it to is Pliny the Elder. Good beer, I would definitely enjoy again."
Lunch,4.28,"16.9oz bottle purchased off the shelf for $6.99 (on sale for $1 off) plus a 5 cent deposit and 8.62% sales tax. Bottled on 7/14/22, so this is exactly one month old.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a translucent haze. There was a thick, off-white head with compact to medium bubbles that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: Aromas of tropical fruit (papaya), stone fruit (apricot, mango), citrus (grapefruit), and pine. Unmistakable green bell pepper aroma. I also get an interesting creamy vanilla note on the nose.

Taste: This is extremely drinkable. This beer has a nice caramel malt backbone to complement the hoppiness. It has a dry finish, which is mild to moderately bitter. The bitterness does not linger on the palate for so long. The finish also has a nice orange zest note along with some spiciness. Pine resin on the finish as well.

Feel: Medium bodied with a very soft mouthfeel. Appropriately carbonated.

Overall: Maine Beer Company does it again. They know how to make very tasty beer!

From the website:
Flavor profile: Aromas of orange, grapefruit, and lemon with pine and herbal undertones. Tropical notes of guava and papaya with subtle caramel and malt sweetness.
Hops: Amarillo, Centennial, Simcoe
Malt: American 2-Row, Caramel 40L, Red Wheat, Munich 10L, Carapils"
Lunch,4.08,"On tap at Habitap in Greenville SC.

Appearance. Slightly hazy amber colored body with a decent white head.

Enticing aroma with a notable note of caramel. Caramel is much more subtle in the hoppy flavor."
Lunch,4.43,world class is correct
Lunch,4.4,"""Drink 90 days from born on date,"" the label said. 31May22. Fresh. Poured into a Rastal Teku glass. The clean design of the white label dictated that.
Aroma was grassy and orange citrusy. It poured a half-finger head of a classical pianist's finger.
The taste followed the scent: grassy with an orange rind taste. Not too at all.
Nice color. A light golden, slightly hazy.
Light mouthfeel. Very easy-going and sippable."
Lunch,5,Probably the best IPA I have never had
Lunch,4.19,"Went to our newest wine store in town, couldn’t believe they had it, and was the last one! This is a very easy drinking IPA. Seems like a West Coast and New England had a baby. Just a little bit of hops and pine but nothing overpowering. Same goes for the fruitiness. Not the best IPA but prob a very good one to start new drinkers with….if you can find it!"
Lunch,4.67,"Poured from 16.9 oz bottle into proper pint glass. Stamped 14DEC21 (best within 90 days…which was about 3 months ago).
A: Pours a clear dark golden yellow hue with 2-3 inch frothy white head with excellent retention.
S: Honeyed melon, white grape, dank grass, subtle tangerine, pine, and cracker malt.
T: Dank grass, honeyed melon, white grape, white pepper, soft and bitter pine resin, tangerine, dry cracker malt, and subtle lemon, earthy, and floral notes. Nice complexity!
M: Light body. Dry throughout with citrus and other fruit sweetness, mildly bitter with subtle earthy and spice elements. Delicate cracker malt backbone. Excellent balance!
D: Wow! What an outstanding APA/IPA (seems to sit right on the border between the two). Superb for style."
Lunch,3.92,"Appearance: Yellow/Blonde glass with serious chill haze. Holds a halo of white foam that leaves a few wisps of lace.

Aroma: Lemongrass hop note, some crystal malt base, mild overall.

Taste: Gentle profile, light slightly earthy, slightly pine hop bitterness blends with a full malt base, slight perfume floral note, little tonic water finish.

Mouthfeel: Slight grit in a silky base, medium heavy carbonation, medium body.

Overall: A little underwhelmed given the big scores it gets. It's a fine beer, just very East Coast in my book. Hops just didn't pop, not nearly citric enough for me, leaving this more of an APA ranged beer. It shipped from Virginia, arrived very warm, that might have taken some of the bloom off of the hops, I'd be happy to try again but I don't see the bones of a great whale here. Still a good catch."
Lunch,4.44,"Poured from a bottle into my tulip glass.

Look: Pretty dark straw head with a thick foamy head. Body itself is crisp but also has slightest tinge of haze.

Smell: Pine, candied orange.

Taste: Orange hops, Some vegetal/grassy notes, even slight onion mid palate. Some graham cracker malt (think honeyed Teddy grahams). Dank pine and grapefruit, sight peppery alcoholic finish. Hoppy but very well balanced.

Feel: Medium bodied, very drinkable.

Drinking a 2 week old Lunch is one of the more pleasant beer experiences I've had in a while. Would love to try this on tap. Awesome beer, well worth seeking out."
Lunch,4.39,"A crisp and clean NEIPA that lives up to its description as an “East Coast version of a West Coast IPA”. Reminiscent of Bell’s Two Hearted, but a little lighter in color and taste. Excellent brew!"
Lunch,4.42,Very drinkable ipa. Found it at string bean in belmont nc
Flora Plum,4.76,"Original bottling

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment"
Flora Plum,4.74,"After Flora Pear, this is my favorite Flora. Excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. Pours a beautiful deep gold, big wine nose, effervescent with plums dancing in the background. Fantastic."
Flora Plum,4.51,"Pours a straw gold. Nose of plum, Lemon, hay, and traditional HF nose. Taste follows with a well blended plum, lemon, hay, minimal acid. Feel is light/medium with medium carb. Overall, this is an excellent fruit beer that is well balanced with the base beer."
Flora Plum,4.62,"Alan, I cannot thank you enough for this bottle.

375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F.

Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible.

Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular.

Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity.

Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead."
Flora Plum,4.84,"Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring.

The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.

Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.

Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar."
Purple Haze,3.5,"Look: Nice color, very interesting looking beer.

Smell: Smells fine, kinda smells like raspberries but not a lot like it. Even though it's a raspberry lager.

Taste: Initial taste is fine at best, after taste is really good, best aftertaste of any beer that i've had, but that's not why we rate beers.

Feel: Fine, nothing special, just fine.

Overall I think this beer is just average, it's good and it's very drinkable, but it's just average."
Purple Haze,2.77,"Cool name, interesting aftertaste but a little disappointing for me. I wanted to taste more of the berries."
Purple Haze,3.7,"L: hazy light amber with a twinge of grapefruit color good head great cap low on the carb streams and slow
S: low fruit raspberry
T: goes in like a cracker finishes like a raspberry
F: thin and low carbonation finishes wet
O: good tasting fruit beer great look just a little thin"
Purple Haze,3.44,"this brew isn't incredibly special but it is very recognizable once you've had it. the dark stone fruit tang tinge is barely there, with the malt being the primary taste factor here, but it is a pleasant addition. it could be amped up in the fruit area to really step into something more notable, but as a simple session'r, it ain't half bad, and sure beats any of the bland swill from mega-corps, and they've managed to stay privately owned all this time, so it's nice to support such spunk.
if you want a much more effectively executed fruit-themed brew from them, try the Strawberry Lager if you can find it."
Purple Haze,2.46,This a watery mess with some subtle artificial raspberry. I'll try it again for more experiences but I really wasn't prepared for it to be this bad to me honestly.
Purple Haze,3.25,A light lager with raspberry flavor throughout. Overall a good starter beer for the craft beer enthusiast who like fruity beers.
Purple Haze,2.95,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.69. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Hazy light orange with a two-finger cream head.
S - Wheat-backed floral notes. Berry, but unsure what sort.
T - Whole wheat, grass, and a touch of petunia. Extremely light raspberry note towards the finish. Not bitter at all.
F - Extremely carbonated. Light, crisp, clean. Very refreshing.
O - I've had this beer before on multiple occasions, and I'm happy to review it for the first time [officially]! It's a refreshing brew for certain, with a vague berry aroma and a wheat-filled aroma. Unfortunately, the raspberry flavor doesn't exactly come out as advertised. In a beer where they make it the main attraction, that's not really a great thing. Will buy again on the basis of its refreshing nature for the price, but it's not something to go out of your way to purchase."
Purple Haze,4.23,"This is a great beer and completely underrated on BA. There is a fruity, berry essence that permeates a sweet, malty backbone, with a slight finish of resiny hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Awesome on the nose and palate. The head and appearance are a little underwhelming, but with a beer that smells and tastes so great, who really cares?"
Purple Haze,3.64,"For the same ABV as Bud Light, very nice. I love these for weeknights or times when I want something sessionable."
Imperial Russian Stout,4.38,"2014 Vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind

S- smoky charred malt, black licorice, dark chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, coffee and caramel

T- intense charred malt up front gives notes of anise, burnt toast and dark roast coffee. Mid-palate gives some dark fruit notes of raisin, fig and prune, along with dark chocolate. The finish gives more charred malt

M- medium/heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety, slightly warming finish

O- a standard bearer of the style, and one that ages with the best of them"
Imperial Russian Stout,4.32,"2014 Vintage dated opened in 2021. It pours a stygian dark brown with a modest light brown head that soon diminishes to nothing. The scent is big: roasted and black malts abound. The taste follows the nose, with a nice blackened malt flavor that doesn't disappoint. Yum!"
Imperial Russian Stout,4.6,Very good.
Imperial Russian Stout,4.04,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV 10.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head. Nice aroma of dark malts and chocolate. Fine roasty flavour, notes of strong coffee and dark bitter chocolate."
Imperial Russian Stout,4.31,3/30/2019
Imperial Russian Stout,4.4,So I let my stout age in my cellar for about 8 months and all I can say is wow. It really aged awesomely. I am super happy I chose to wait on this one because this stuff is dope. Stone for life
Imperial Russian Stout,3.43,Pitch black. A small amount of head appeared. Sweet smell of dates/ fruity. Can taste molasses. Notice the strong alcohol taste. Not a very sticky feel.
Imperial Russian Stout,4.43,"This is a 22oz bottle of the '2014 RELEASE'. Label displays 11%ABV.
Nearly opaque black colored body, with the thinnest of bottom edge showing dark brown back lit highlights. Two finger tan creamy head, which recedes to thin cap and ring. Leaves behind some rings of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dark fruits.
Taste is dark roasted malts, which express dark chocolate and dark roast coffee. The dark fruit shows up close to the end. The black licorice is a minor note throughout.
Full mouth feel, super creamy. Good carbonation.
The alcohol is there but not super strong. This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.

Bottle Notes:
Brewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!"
Imperial Russian Stout,4.24,"Bottled in March 2016. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, espresso tan foam with medium low retention. Rich, dark roasted and grainy malt aromas with dark chocolate and earthy, tobacco-like notes and light booziness. Rich and full bodied with medium light carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Roasted malt flavors up front with notes of dark chocolate and charred grainy malt. Medium earthy hop bitterness through the middle followed by chocolate and dark malt flavors. Bitterness transitions to warming booziness to the end. Finished semi-dryly with bitter dark chocolate and roasted maltiness with a light boozy heat. Great aromas and rich flavors with a fabulous feel and pleasant warmth."
Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,"2015 version - bottled 03/05/15, so just short of 4 years. Pours a thick black with brown head, reddish highlights. Smell is sweet roasty coffee, bit of dark fruits, licorice, and faintly chocolate. Tastes more of the dark chocolate but still with coffee, hints of the licorice, a bit oaky. Smooth rich mouthfeel - notes of the booze - but a bit of that lingering coffee bitterness at the finish. Warm and inviting of another sip."
Imperial Russian Stout,4.28,"2015 bottle. Excellent RIS, dried fruit flavors of fig and date."
Imperial Russian Stout,4.46,2016 aged almost 3 years
Imperial Russian Stout,4.56,2014 release gifted from arizcards...thank you my brother!
Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,2.24,"Medium orange hue; very see-through. Obviously filtered.

Noticeable bitterness & hop aroma in the nose.

Nice white head, good lacing throughout.

As for the taste...where did the hops go?! They're in the nose but vanish on the tongue. Tastes very much like a lager to me. This has 3 months left on it's 'best before' date, so can't blame it on age.

Watery, with no discernable flavor. A touch of bitterness on the back end, but hardly noticeable. After an interesting nose, this macro falls way flat."
Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,3.65,"From notes 3/6/13: Pours bronze amber producing 1.5 inches of frothy, beige, moderately lasting head that recedes to leave nice sheets of webby lacing. Aroma is fresh and hoppy with pine, earthy herbal and citrus notes with a caramel malt background. Taste is same with a heavier malt backbone with a lingering bitter aftertaste."
Samuel Adams Latitude 48 IPA,1,Poor excuse for an IPA
Heineken Lager Beer,2.7,"This is without a doubt, the most inconsistent beer on the market. Majority of the time I have had one, it' been skunky and not enjoyable at all. Yeah, the look s good and the feel is pleasant, but the skunky, bitter taste leaves you not wanting another. Freshness and storage is key to getting a Heineken that tastes okay."
Heineken Lager Beer,3.6,"Drank from 12 oz green bottle; no birth date. Taste of flat carbonation with slight but don’t biuscut taste. For what it is, there is far better out there"
Heineken Lager Beer,2,Not much to say simple enough beer
Heineken Lager Beer,2.72,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, ""best by"" date ""May - 2023"".

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, light golden color with 1 finger white head with decent retention, the head slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there was minimal lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.

SMELL: sweet corn and Euro skunk.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet corn and then a skunky Euro hop profile.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: I used to drink this at the country club and thought it was classy, until the craft beer movement changed my life forever, now I just think it's another AAL except the bottle is green and it was brewed in Holland, it's overly sweet and skunky, I would not seek this out again."
Heineken Lager Beer,2.41,Not my favorite
Heineken Lager Beer,2.47,"I put together a mix-six at the local supermarket. I included a bottle of Heineken. I hadn't had a Heineken in years--maybe 40; I remember it as a crisp, fresh, beer, much better than the American AALs of the era. I saw the ""malt lager"" appellation on the label, and thought that this must be a new product, an all-malt Heineken. Turns out it's the same, classic Heineken: It's an adjunct based lager, a bit hoppy but with a sweet overlay in the flavor that I suppose is a result of the corn in the recipe. I was a bit surprised by the extent to which I disliked it--I could barely finish the bottle. The sweetness clung to it all the way down. I love all things Dutch--visiting the country, cycling in it, exploring and savoring Amsterdam--with the exception, I guess, of this beer."
Heineken Lager Beer,2.63,"Poured from a 24oz can best by March 2023 into a pils glass.

On thr pour a fine 3 finger head forms woth a light straw body that has strong carbonation. Head retention is good, but it becomes fizzy looking. Vague lacing.

Aroma is largely light skunked hops, mistreated lager yeast, and some light but bright esters. Maybe some vague corniness but not a lot of malt other than that.

Taste is quite similar to the smell woth the same off notes right up front. As some of the cheap euro characteristics fade a slight floral happiness does stick through in the largely bitter hop extract. Once again a light and oxidized corny maltiness barely shows up on the finish.

Feel is fizzy with a lot of carbonation bite. It's easy to drink but not the smoothest from all the off flavors. Not as watery as expected but bretty light. Longer finish but not great.

Overall this is a meh beer that's overpriced I only picked it up because it's the last thing that isn't a high gravity malt liquor left that I haven't reviewed out of the 24oz singles at my local shitty liquor store. I wish it was maltier, but I guess the hops are actually detectable albeit gross."
Heineken Lager Beer,4,My personal favorite pilsner. Light and refreshing and has a nice flavor and hop profile. Doesn't taste like water like most other pilsners.
Heineken Lager Beer,3.57,"Light Golden color, clear and has a white head. Smells very malt forward with a hint of citrus. Taste alright, kinda boring. Malty, some nuttiness and a hint of citrusy crispness. Overall its a alright, easy drinker. Its refreshing but its nothing special."
Heineken Lager Beer,1.42,"Perhaps the worst, if not, one of them. The taste is like a sack of coins steeped in water. Beware!"
Heineken Lager Beer,1.68,"Imported Heineken is horrible.
I had it on tap on the Rock of Gibraltar and it was amazing.
It could have been the fact that it was very hot & I was very thirsty, but that was the best Heiny I ever had!
The bottled stuff to me tastes like stale hops and moldy malt.
I despise it."
Heineken Lager Beer,3.12,"Best By Date: September 2022

A - Light gold pour with vibrant carbonation.

S - Caramel, rice, and corn aroma.

T - Starts with some light earthy caramel malt followed with very light citrus, and then has a slight bit of toasted caramel on the finish.

M - Light medium body

O - This beer is what it is. It's been a staple in the beer world for a long time but not my gig. The fact I'm actually writing a review is really a feat in itself. This beer was brewed for quaffing, not sipping. All good."
Heineken Lager Beer,2.6,Drinkable beer if it’s fresh and ice cold. Once it begins to warm up the taste turns sour and skunky. This is a beer I’ll drink if it’s given to me but will never buy. At $3.40 per can in Ontario there are a lot of better options at the same price or cheaper.
Heineken Lager Beer,3.22,"Sparkling pale gold with a tall white head settling to a very thickly persistent white blanket clinging well in doily lacing.

Just now realizing I have only ever had Heine Light, this is way less skunky than its younger sister, and it's actually got some faint banana characteristics. Color me dumbfounded!

Aside from that, there are notes of fresh baked buns with a slight tang of lemon rind, and its got a fluffy medium body that finishes semi-dry.

Wow, I really thought this would be a sub-3 score."
Heineken Lager Beer,2.83,"My first Heineken—I made sure to get it in a can to avoid risk of skunk. Smell was fine—a little fruity. Taste is just meh. Not the worst macro, but not as flavorful as the crafts I prefer. Average at best."
Heineken Lager Beer,1.36,How this has survived for so long is well beyond my ability to comprehend. Throughout all the many years I've occasionally revisited this vile stuff it's always had a rather revolting aroma which carries through into the taste. An off-taste which appears popular.
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.5,Smokey
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.94,"Had low expectations. But, my gawd! This beer blew me away. Easily the best porter I’ve ever had."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.25,"Excellent Porter. One of the best. Roasty, complex, bold. Super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase. Got to try High Coast next to it too. Amazing combo!!!"
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.63,"Pours jet black with a small tan head. Intense roast bordering on Smokey. Chocolate. Definitely some bourbon heat along with vanilla infused oak. Quite dry. Heat of the alcohol overwhelms my palate making tough to judge IBUs. Full bodied, long lasting finish."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.44,"Bottle, RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, creamy brown head. Very nice aroma of chocolate and roasted malts, hints of oak. Intensely rich and complex flavour: oaky, vinous, roasty, chocolate, liquorice. An excellent beer, but so is the ""ordinary"" Stormaktsporter."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,4.57,"2018 Bottle in a BIF courtesy of MTKATL

L: Jet black with a caramel colored head

S: Smokey, heavy dark fruit notes

T: Smokey and reminent of Black Albert, a better overall representation of a European porter. Very enjoyable, dark fruits. Has a hint of barrel, despite not being a ba stout

F: Thick and heavy, surprisingly so for being non BA

O: Very happy to have tried this beer, it is a throwback and still masterfully done."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,3.87,"2018. Was fine. Wasn't as great as I expected. Pretty light, smoky taste. Nice body for a porter. Comes in a very small bottle, around 8.2 ounces."
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,2.35,"2014 review.... it’s boozy, but I’m no way does this compare to today’s barrel aged beers or flavored barrel aged stouts, this is crap...... boozy and messy. Low grade fuel and GTFOH with stupid old money v new money comments"
Nugget Nectar,4.41,Wow! Drank this one ice cold and right out of the can. When I opened it the beer was filled right up to the top and sort of just overflowed a bit. The smell was hops and hops and exactly what I like. The taste was definitely of a hoppy nature and the ABV just adds to the enjoyment. I will positively be looking for more when I can.
Nugget Nectar,4.5,"Finally had several of these sent from some NJ family so I can try this top-notch-hyped imperial red. I could never catch it available when visiting. Pours a deep and clear golden color with a modest head.
Nose is like sweet cakey/ candies malts and hops all together, makes me want to taste.
The flavor goes there, it’s so much flavor up front with sweet caramel and tasty hops, just a well-balanced impeccable red IPA. Resin/ earthiness is a defining characteristic, and it’s tasty. Tingly fresh hop bitterness lives in this beer. It ends superbly. Amazing balance.
Feels perfect. Smooth and smooth, then smooth. Slight stickiness, vanishes superbly and I’m ready for more.
I can see why this gets the love.
It’s like a Hop Wallop meets a red ale, masterfully and silky."
Nugget Nectar,4.25,"Pours a nearly clear mahogany color with a small foamy white head and a moderate amount of lacing.

Smells of piney, grassy hops and malt.

Tastes of mildly bitter, peppery hops throughout with smaller tastes malt, caramel and pineapple.

Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth dry mouthfeel.

This beer is an enjoyable mash up of a Wee Heavy and a West Coast IPA. Scotch IPA?"
Nugget Nectar,4.35,"One of those beers I drink plenty of and then surprised that I haven't rated it yet. So anyway, an attractive appearance; clear copper, nice size head, good lacing. Aroma is equally appealing, earthy and herbal with subtle notes of citrus. Resinous quality on the palate along with the herbal influence. Finishes a bit spicy. Bitterness adds depth and balance. Best by date of 5/11/22"
Nugget Nectar,3.69,Beautiful pour with one finger foam. Smell is pine and malt. The taste is very much on the edge of IPA…..almost too close. I don’t have much experience with this style but if you told me it was an IPA I wouldn’t bat an eye. Keep that in mind before you try …. This is hoppier than your average Red.
Nugget Nectar,4.44,"Poured a very pleasing amber color with active carbonation and a manila folder (Google it if you've never seen one) colored head that left plenty of lacing.
Aroma, even to my chemical damaged nose, was very nice. Obvious malts and hops play parts in the dance; I can't say I got the ""pine, resin and mango"" that the can states are prominent but it is very pleasant.
The taste, found it hard not to think of this as an IPA, it's just on that cusp. Likely the hoppiest red ale I've ever had, but that's not a bad thing at all; it's delicious!
The feel falters only in that it's way to drinkable for it's ABV. I could quaff this down by the liter if given the opportunity.
OA, Seriously good beer, all the way around. The denizens of Hershey, PA are fortunate to have this on tap."
Nugget Nectar,4.29,"Clear and bright body, medium amber colored; excellent carbonation, fine bubbles and gently rising; huge, white head, sculpted and densely creamy. Strong scent of pine resin offset with gentle caramel notes. Outstanding taste, well-balanced and complex; light malt base with a moderate to bold hop bitterness; some peppery spiciness. Medium-heavy body; softly abrasive; light sweetness countered with a moderate overall dryness.

A most extraordinary ale, well-crafted and bursting with balance, flavor, and immensely pleasurable appearance.

Pouring temperature: 45 °F; canning data: FRESHEST BY 05/11/2022"
Nugget Nectar,4.83,"On tap in the pine room in a frosty pint glass. Perfectly balanced. Hoppy but not too. A hint of sweetness. Nice soft head.

Hard to stop pouring this beer and at 7.5 …. My current fav!"
Nugget Nectar,4.27,"Can into pint glass; freshest by 4/28/2022.

L: Orangey-copper, crystal clear, with a substantial head and good retention/lacing. I hate to drink it because it looks so nice.
S: Mostly hop bitterness, a few citrus notes.
T: Just nailed-on balance between the malt and hops, slightly resinous finish
F: Very smooth, a little sticky.
O: Worth the hype, the highlight of the Tröegs lineup for me. Almost by itself makes PA winter tolerable."
Nugget Nectar,4.31,"I suppose I'll contradict myself and say that I'm not overly enthusiastic about beers with ramped up ABV scores. Too often, I find that the pleasure of the mouthfeel is compromised when the main thing you taste is the octane. With that said, I'm always impressed by beers that are a little stronger but bring the complex flavor into the foreground. Seems like that's the kind of thing ""craft"" is all about. I do love the Tröegs company and their creativity and sensibility, but I don't love all their beers (which is no knock on them at all). But for my money, Nugget Nectar is some of their finest work. It's such a pleasurable beer to drink; flavorful with a kind of well-earned sweetness, beautiful balance of the different hop notes and malt, and a stunning color in the glass. Over the years, I've cycled through a number of Tröegs beers, giving many a try, but I'm finally prepared to say that this is my favorite of all I've tried. This is the one I wait for every year and buy whenever it comes to my beer store."
Nugget Nectar,4.35,The hop flavor is excellent I honestly thought this was an IPA. I really enjoyed this and would absolutely have again
Nugget Nectar,4.24,"L: Copper brown very slightly hazy, good 2-3 finger head

S: Malt but balances with the hops, slightly sweet

T: I get some pretty good hops for an ale, malt, and slightly sour resiny taste

F: Medium-bodied, easy going down, clean finish, moderate mouthfeel

O: A very solid, delicious beer. If would have tasted this blind I would have called it an IPA and while I have not had a lot of red ales this one is excellent. Available only 1x per year around the holidays, lucky I live only about an hour away from the brewery. Troegs hit this one on the head."
Nugget Nectar,4.5,"Nugget Nectar is pretty much everything I want....sweet, malty, fruity, bitey, and hoppy. It is hands down, one of my favorite beers. Delish, every time. Troegs knows what's up."
Nugget Nectar,4.19,"L: Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger white head. Good retention.

S: Balanced with piney hops and sweet malt

T: Caramel malt, honey, piney hops, resin. Very balanced.

F: Medium bodied, easy to drink, clean finish

O: This is a solid beer. Not a style I’m super familiar with but no detectable faults."
Nugget Nectar,4.94,This beer is really good. Although I would not suggest it for those who just started craft beer drinking. It has nothing in it that would wow a non craft beer drinker. But It has everything a craft beer lover would love in a beer. However the appearance isn’t anything to write about. But I guess that’s ok.
Nugget Nectar,3.81,Can courtesy of
Nugget Nectar,4.23,"12 oz. can, freshest by 4/19/2022. Cream colored foam on a reddish copper body. The aroma is bit weak on this batch but what is there is indicative of the flavor, which is florid, hoppy, and mildly bitter. The red ale aspect is evident in the creamy feel of the body. A wonderful beer for these cold winter nights."
Nugget Nectar,4.75,"Nugget Nectar Ale has a thick, spongy, ivory head and a clear, bubbly orange appearance, with heavy lacing. The aroma is of dark bread crust and hop resins. It has a similar flavor, with building bitterness. Nugget Nectar Ale has a medium body and a dry finish.

RJT"
Nugget Nectar,4.33,"Really solid beer. Drinks enough like an IPA to please a hop head, smooth enough to please most pils lovers, and diverse in profile enough to please most sour seekers. I think it's just a really well-crafted beer. A lot of love was put into making this gem."
Nugget Nectar,2.69,Nothing special.
Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,"Canned 04/07/22.
A maltier and darker IPA than I expected but still delicious. I’ve never had their Citra DIPA but I imagine this is a near polar opposite. Rich, caramel malt complement the earthy hops. A nice change of pace."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.29,"Just Outstanding, canned 05/03/22 looks super good, rich, orange hazy with a big thick head, smells of fruit, citrus and malt. The taste is really nice with the apricot like flavor. Only hints of citrus and clove that finishes slightly dry and bitter. Overall a very nice IPA from California and my beloved @RaulMondesi, thanks for sharing."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.25,"Getting back to basics, the American IPA has never celebrated bitterness better than in its West Coast varieties. Kern River's take on the sub-style is just bitter, just dry, just clean and just refreshing. All in all, it's just outstanding!

So Just Outstanding IPA gets going with a bubbly pour of hazy golden and orange hues. As its frothy white cap tops the rim, the common but clean and sharp fragrance of citrus, botanicals, spruce and peppery hops create a nearly citronella character on the nose. Simple and sweet in its malt profile, the beer's early taste is redolent with lighter versions of caramel, honey, toasted nuttiness and crust in a slight granola kind of way.

As the hops unfold on the middle palate, the simply blossom with citrus flavor. Branch-ripe tangerine coupled with ruby red grapefruit and the brightness of lime and a juicy impression of citrus evolve. A background of pineapple and lighter mango add a rounded fruitiness to the hops for a complex and flavorful balance. As the malt influences starts to dissolve off the tongue, the juiciness of citrus fades and its bitterness begins to take its place, providing strong impressions of pine sap, fruit peels, peppery grasses and herbs and an overall botanical gin-like counterpart once the alcohol flavors arrive.

Medium bodied and trending lighter, dry, crisp and highly refreshing, the relatively error-free IPA is a remarkably brewed IPA that's a standout in a crowded IPA market. Finishing snappy and lingering with bitterness, the session concludes with a comforting hop bite."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.4,"16 ounce can into plastic cup in my Orange Tustin Hotel room. Canned on 2/11/22. Pours very hazy golden amber/light orange color with a 1 finger dense and creamy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of big red grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, apricot, mango, honeydew melon, passion fruit, berries, citrus peel/rind, wood, pepper, pine, wheat, bread dough, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-medium pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body. Creamy/bready malts, some sticky hops, and light resins in the mouthfeel. Soft finish with lingering resin dryness and no hop astringency. Minimal warming 6.8% or hop burn after the finish. Amazing Simcoe and Amarillo profile. Super juicy hops with some dank and earthy notes, and a soft hazy malt backbone. Loved the hop profile as expected."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.37,"Very bold color, nose and flavors. Pours darker than most IPAs, with a tanned color. Head was white that disappeared into nice lacing. Nose is malty with piney. Taste bittery and lots of malt. Very nice change from the typical IPA."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.22,A very good option for a traditional American IPA. Beautiful orange body with a great head and lacing. Smell is a bit light with a hint of maltiness in the middle and citrus at the back. Taste is good albeit uneven: it packs a juicy front but dissipates quickly. Feel is exactly where it should be--it's full in the front and middle--even as it fades a bick quickly. It is exactly what it should be.
Just Outstanding IPA,3.5,"Small glass from draught @ Zeezicht Breda. Pours a light hazy deep golden colour with a thick frothy off white head with some lacing. Aroma's of grassy hops, a little old, fruit. Retronasal it's fruity and old hops. Flavour is moderate sweet and moderate bitter. Medium bodied. Finishes with a short firm bitterness, dry. I will have to try this fresh at some point."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.21,"Canned
L: Copper, very light haze. 1 minute post pour.. light head, sticky lacing.
S: Floral, earthy and very light citrus in background.
T: Earthy, citrus and quite malty.
F: Medium, a bit carbonated.. low bitterness.
O: I've had this many times over the last year, and it does not disappoint. My only knock is the ""cold"" bite. As it warms, the malts take over and smooth the ride. I smuggled 6 of these back east recently."
Just Outstanding IPA,3.24,"Ho hum, another day another IPA.

Yet another thin, overly hopped beer with no subtlety. Nothing here worth getting excited about."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.27,"Pours a deep orange, with thick, fluffy head.

Smell is slightly medicinal with pine, resin and some grapefruit.

Taste is old school west coast, citrusy piney and bitter, with a twist of peach in the end.

Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.

Overall, a terrific west coast IPA, very well balanced."
Just Outstanding IPA,4.5,"This is an exemplary ale. I only have one of these left from my second six-pack this month, and I think I'm going to have to pick it up again if it's still on shelves locally.

L: Poured hard into a goblet, it produces ample bone-white head, which settles into a film of snowy billows with thick sheets of lacing to match. A faintly hazy and somewhat viscous honey-colored body reveals several fine streams of tiny bubbles throughout.

S: Fruity and enticing. Pine jumps out, as does lemon rind, followed by orange juice, and a hint of passion and piña, then mango takes over for a good second, coming finally into an an herbal finish with muddled mint and pine over yeasty pizza dough.

T: Would be incredible, except the hop profile leans too far on the herbal side for my taste. Drowns out all the lovely fruity character. I taste mostly grapefruit pith, passion fruit, mango, and pine. A touch of malty sweetness balances it out.

F: Very nice. Truly medium bodied. Plenty of smooth texture, but light enough to crush.

O: Just outstanding: not mind-blowing, but a head and shoulders above the median. A-"
Just Outstanding IPA,3.4,"APPEARANCE: Somewhere between straw and orange, with a slight haze. The head is stack white foam and froth standing about two and a half fingers above the surface in a tulip glass. The lacing doesn’t cover a huge percentage of the glass, but it organizes itself into big, pillowy tufts that mark the rim of each previous sip.

SMELL: A nice blend of orange peel, floral notes, and grapefruit. The intensity of the aroma fades with the head, but fortunately a nice cap remains to keep it rolling.

TASTE: This is way more malty than I expected from the nose and from the aroma. Wow. Pretty heavy stuff. That said, there is more than enough hop flavor in here to pull through the malt. A lot of that orange peel comes through, but it’s now joined by a little more grapefruit, a lot more malt, and a noticeable minty flavor.

MOUTHFEEL: One of the bigger bodied IPAs I’ve had from that big malt base. However, it is not overly sweet and a pleasant hop bitterness (especially on the end of the sip) helps balance this beer out and at least leaves the perception of dryness. The carbonation is strong, which also helps quite a bit.

OVERALL: This is not what I expected at all. Again, much bigger malt, some unique flavor with the big mint pop in there, but overall pretty decent. I do not think this beer is past its prime (it was given to me less than a week ago from a friend in San Diego), but the lack of a date code doesn’t allow me to know for sure, which is frustrating."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.89,"I like dark beer. Something about the darker the better. Smokey, caramel, root beer, malt. Taste is like This the root beer of the Gods. Smokey. malt caramel, wood, leather, bark, ancient love, Smoother than a cheerleader's thighs. WOW BEER! OCTOBERFEST! PROST!
I reserve the right to change my mind."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.29,"500 ml bottle poured into a tall Weihenstephan flute.
Amazing what can be done with just 4 ingredients, isn’t it?
A good German dopplebock with all the dunkles starkbier qualities!"

S: Soft, delicate treacle aroma.
T: Malt loaf, plum, caramel, treacle toffee. Alcohol is present but understated.
F: Super smooth mouthfeel with a gently foaming, almost creamy, finish.
O: A highly enjoyable, easy-to-drink, dark & malty brew. Was I expecting a tad more for the 7.4%? Maybe."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a slightly clear, mostly dark, but hints of an amber hue, brown color with a strong, light tan head. SRM of 22. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of brown bread, banana bread, hints of chocolate and caramel. Some cream on the end. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of brown bread, nuts, banana bread, tiramisu and bread pudding, with a creamy finish. The flavors here are on point. (4.25).

Feel: Light to medium-bodied for the style, yet finishes with a creamy note that lingers on the palate asking for another sip. (4.00)

Overall: A really nice doppelbock here. It has fantastic flavors of brown bread, bananas, nuts, chocolate, tiramisu, bread pudding, all with a creamy finish. The body is slightly lighter for the style, but the flavors are there. The alcohol is detectable but not overpowering. A pretty standard representation of the style."

Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.06,"0.5 L bottle
Glass: 0.5 L Mug
Serving Temp: approx 48 - 50 degrees F
Bottle Code: 1089 (guessing that would be in Feb, 2019?)

Look: Dark brown with mahogany highlights when held to a light. Opaque, even when held to a light. Huge initial beige-to-khaki head that took up almost 1/4 of the mug and was higher than the top of the mug. After sipping, the head broke up and became a thin khaki film on top of the beer. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Rich semi-sweet chocolate over top of figs and dark bread

Taste: Sweeter than the nose. Milk chocolate and molasses with figs and hints of raisins. Pumpernickel bread. Things dry out towards the end and finish on a dry chocolate/cocoa note.
Feel: Creamy and mouth-coating. Medium body.

Overall: An enjoyable and drinkable doppelbock. Definitely ""liquid bread"". This has a nice dry and chocolatey note that I like in doppelbocks. It is sweet, but not overly sweet nor cloying."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.9,"Poured from a 500mL bottle into my weizen glass.

On the pour a nice big head forms that maintains shape above the rim of the glass. Head does dissipate to just a ring over the course of drinking but not too fast. Color is dark brown, and some light gets through but in darker lighting it looks black. No lacing.

The nose is of dry fruit and some roasty malts. Slight funk, this might be a bit old, but pretty one note. Dry fruit funky like rasin and molasses.

Taste is better than the smell. More of the roasty malts come through and the funk is slightly there but only vaguely. Taste is still quite heavy which is to be expected. Some bitterness after the main malt washes away and leaves you with a slightly bitter pure malt aftertaste.

Feel is a bit lighter than expected based on everything else reviewed, not necessarily a bad thing and it makes this beer a bit dangerous because based on feel alone it's quite easy to put down. Definitely a cold weather beer still.

Overall it's a nice big beer. Maybe doppelbocks aren't my favorite but there is a bit of funk in here. Strong in flavor but still easy to drink."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.66,"Dark brown, ruby look with a beige foamy head that recedes to nothing. Smells of milk chocolate and small bits of coffee there is also a malt flavor with a toast smell too.
Immediately I knew this was the best beer I’ve ever had. Taste of semi-sweet to milk chocolate. There is also large notes of cocoa powder, think Swiss Miss packets. This is the highest quality beer I’ve ever had. I can tell that all the ingredients are really high quality. This is overall a complex but simple beer taste wise. Meaning; there isn’t any middle ground taste. There is some small notes of hazelnut. There is a medium to low carbonation. This is a semi-sweet beer. Really smooth feel drinking too.
This is a fantastic beer. I love it. Almost perfect, but God alone is perfect Matthew 5:48."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.33,"Pours a clear dark brown with a low tan head and moderate lacing.

Smells of toasted malt, yeast and raisins.

Tastes of sweet, toasted malt, molasses, chocolate, raisins and dates. there is a slight alcohol warmth to the finish.

Medium body with very light carbonation. Lush slightly syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a sweet, subtle and complex brew."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.93,Big bottle from John’s poured into tulip. Description/notes are spot-on. Nice solid doppelbock.
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.27,Pours a dark brown with veins of dark red a la a Coca Cola or a Dr Pepper. Getting some chocolate covered almonds and raisin on the nose. It's dark chocolate forward. There's some raisinette character on the finish. It's a nice doppelbock.
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.13,"I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany amber with off white head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had chocolate malt base with typical Dunkel flare. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.89,"Appearance: Pours a very dark brown color with some ruby hues towards the bottom of the glass. Thin ring of tan foam on top. Very nice lacing.

Smell: Fragrant and inviting. Rye bread, cherries, caramel, fruitcake, raisins. Smells absolutely beautiful.

Taste: First sip puts an instant smile on my face. Dark bread, hint of caramel, dates, dark chocolate, roasted nuts, very little bitterness, not overly sweet. The chocolate comes through more as it warms. Very good balance. Scrumptious.

Feel: Medium to full bodied, creamy, ample carbonation, finishes dry with the slightest wimper of alcohol warmth.

Overall: One of the best beers I've had. Thank you to everyone that had a hand in making this, well done."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,3.99,"Half liter bottle served in pint glass. Dark cola brown with good clarity and no head formation. Dark malty aroma of prunes familiar to these dark bock beers. Very rich, very fruity, like stewed stone fruit and figs. Sweet flavors but a clean finish. In a lot of ways this reminds me of a British rather than German style. Very tasty, balanced, and drinkable. Fine carbonation.

Not quite as complex as Aventinus, but still an exceptional doppelbock and worth seeking out."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.88,Finally made an account after 10 years to rate this beer. Truly the greatest winter beer I have ever had. The taste is exceptionally rich yet smooth and subtle all at the same time. Every swig is like drinking some chocolate malt and gingerbread cookies mixed together. I’m leaving this out for Santa instead of cookies
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.75,"This is history in a glass. SO deep and complex, you have to be wasted to even try it. WOrld class richness in its aroma complexity and flavor. It takes time to really appreciate the matrix of flavor that this brew provides. Pours a deep dark goblet that is inner-earth darkness. Provides a rich creamy head of khaki cream, and a plethora of beautiful aromas. Deep fruity prune. malt, molasses and broad sweet richness that entices the taster into a trance. The full sweetness hits you on the taste, like a charge of molasses stallions, grinding bold malts. Rich, syrupy, and decadent, this is a brew that demands respect and admiration of its brewing history and process. This is a world class beer you enjoy after a few big ones. Fairly heavy and yet a decent finish, it's history lesson in the glass, if you can appreciate it. Not for the novice swill chugger. if you know, you know. Historical, world class brew for sipping. in the winter."
Weihenstephaner Korbinian,4.53,"16.9oz bottle into a tall lager glass.
L: Pours cola brown w/root beer edges, good carbonation, thin fizzy tan head that recedes quickly to nothing, no lacing.
S: Dark bread crust, toasted grains, char, honey, toasted bread, grape juice, dark fruits.
T: Sweet, dark honey, dark dried fruit, resinous and woody, char, lemon/lime citrus zest, a hint of citrus fruit, caramelized malts, lightly nutty, for sure some chocolate.
F: Thick, heavy lightly syrupy cola mouthfeel with a moderately long drying finish. Fairly clean.
O: A hefty and beautiful tasting Starkbier. Sweet on the lips, lightly bitter on the tongue. Full flavored, full bodied, firm. It is outstanding in it's style."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.24,Finally enjoying this after many years of it sitting in my beer fridge. Nice looking beer...very dark with a finger of mocha colored head that receded to a thin cap and slightly thicker ring. Maple comes through on the nose and the tongue. Wonderfully full chewy feel. Good beer.
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.3,"2018 Vintage.
Black, with as light brown foam.
In the smell coffee, toasted notes, maple syrup, vanilla.
Very smooth taste, again maple syrup, sweet caramel. And a lot of vanilla.
Relatively easy to drinf for its 11+ ABV.
Good."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.74,"2018 Vintage pours a thick black color with a medium bodied tan colored head that laces a bit on the way down. Smells of deep roasted malts, big chocolate, coffee, maple aromas with a hint of bourbon at the end of it. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, maple, bourbon but balanced very well. Rich feeling, thick, you can feel the heft on this one but it's really well done. Overall this is an excellent beer, I hope they bring this back into rotation."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.3,"Picked this up as a single. Did they stop brewing this one? They wanted $8.xx for a bottle!

L: probably should be higher but I don’t see it fundamental difference between this and something 25% of the price.
S: the best part. Very complex and interesting. The maple syrup and cocoa are strong but, to my nose, there’s a wonderful rye whiskey spice here.
T: follows the nose to an extent but not as good as I remember. Same stuff happening but kinda stunted.
F: oh yeah, no doubt this is barrel-aged. Filling, low carbonation, boozy almost chewy.
O: the 100 rating is insane. I have had far superior beers for less."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),5,"Perfect.

Pitch black with nice head.

Delicious smell of chocolate.

Smooth with a hint of sweetness. ( Maybe only negative - a bit too sweet. )

Excellent.

Update on 5/30/22: Was able to get a bottle from 10/9/19. Still absolutely delicious. Sweet, but nicely so. Not overwhelming, or cloying."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.77,Nectar of the gods. Can't believe Founders stopped brewing it.
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.85,"Poured aggressively into a stout glass after a marathon training run on a cold but sunny day. Color is dark brown, nearly black, 1” brown head with fair retention, some lacing.

Nose: Immediate fragrance of maple syrup, bourbon, and dark roast, some chocolate, considerable sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, plenty thick.

Attack: Complex combination of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and maple syrup. There’s a lot going on in this fine brew.

Finish: Some hops but very well balanced. Lingering taste of alcohol.

Overall: This was a near perfect marathon training recovery drink!"
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),5,"I love how well balanced it is, with loads of robust chocolate and coffee, just the right amount of alcohol and sweetness. Nice full and creamy mouthfeel."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),2.61,"Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed. Ah well."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.49,"Bottled 10/9/19. Bottle to tulip glass.

L: Very dark brown, almost black. Small head that settled quickly; very little lacing.
S: Low aroma, mainly of bourbon. The barrel is here but it's more oak than maple syrup. A little roasty, too.
T: Very sweet, but balances really well with the malt and the bourbon heat. I remember this being too much maple when it was new but after two years it's almost perfectly balanced.
F: Thick, a little bitter at the back. Boozy but not overwhelmingly so.
O: Might be the best of the Breakfast Stout variants."
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),4.37,"Deep chestnut colored with a low light brown head that rises up minimally and settles out quickly. Low aroma of cocoa and maple bourbon. Rich flavors of cocoa, root beer, bourbon, maple, leather. Well balanced, not boozey, very tasty. Even mouthfeel, smooth with slight tingle in the finish."

T - chocolate and some coffee. Nice mix. Sweet tasting.
F - thick mouthfeel and smooooth. Semi-dry finish.
O - strong but not with being over the top with alcohol. 11.3% hidden well. A good sipping beer for sure. Warmed me up."

Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.13,"Pours black with a couple fingers of khaki foam. Aroma is sticky resin, with toasty and roasty malts underneath. Sticky, but dark, with earthy undertones. Flavor profile is sticky resin and mild dank hops, with roasty and toasty malts underneath. Caramel and earthy flavors build as the beer warms. It's a really sticky IPA, but with dark stout undertones. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a mild velvet, fluffy texture. Very low grit. Overall, sticky dark beer, which is always a juxtaposition, but in a favorable way.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes."

Good bitter hop mouthfeel initially, more flavors appears across the tongue. Great lasting carbonation. No alcohol heat. Dry finish.
Great flavor combination with the piney hops and dark malt. Always a place for this beer."
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,5,"I’m very impressed with Stone for this one—most Stone IPAs have the same exact generic bitterness; however, this one is different; this one has a balanced hop flavor, balanced bitterness, and is oh-so-smooth. Pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in, yet looks basically black poured into a glass. Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed. Nice work on a unique brew, Stone. Try it while you can as it is a limited re-release."
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.66,Very different from other black ipa's. The look is the same but the hop characters are very different. Not as malty but happy and delicious. Grassy and floral but very drinkable.
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.47,"Poured cola brown and looked black in the glass.
Aroma was actually hoppy for me, which was surprising as most black “IPAs” are more malty than hoppy.
Taste followed, this actually tastes like an IPA, with an abundance of malty flavors like coffee and cocoa.
Feel is excellent too, almost crushable in mouth feel, very crisp like almost.
Glad I finally found one to try, I’ll be on the lookout."
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.33,Pours black with a tan head. Smells of hoppy goodness and roasted malt. The flavor of the dark malt with the hops is outstanding. Lingering bitterness.I am glad I finally got to try this one.
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.27,"This is probably the best black IPA I have ever had due to the roasted malts and chocolate undertones.

L: Nearly black with brown highlights and tan bubbles with good retention.
S: Citrus peel and roasted malt.
T: Toasted malts, citrus fruit bitter hops, chocolate and coffee. Interesting combination not common in an IPA.
F: medium body.
O: excellent and unique."
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.12,"Poured from can dark black but not thick like a stout. Head was slightly tan that left decent lacing. Nose is dank like an old school IPA. Taste is sort of chocolate or cocoa, but then it fades to a bitterness that had sticking power. Took a while for the bitterness to fade (GOOD THING!) Good beer."

12 oz. can dated 12/22/21 - 8.7% ABV / 90 IBU
Brewed and canned in Richmond, VA
Poured into a Bell's branded tulip snifter glass

Look - Pours a thick and dense light tan head that leaves lacing. Pitch black appearance with small amounts of light coming through revealing a reddish hue.
Smell - Not getting much aroma from the beer while it's cold. Maybe some toasted malt. As the beer warms, there's the scent of pine, grapefruit, coffee, and faint dark fruit coming forth.
Taste - Initial taste is charred malt and pine that brings a nice bitterness. Getting light chocolate and citrus flavors as the beer warms. Also getting dark fruit and berry qualities. Can't detect any alcohol flavor.
Feel - Medium bodied with a sharp mouthfeel and you can feel the booze burn on the back of the tongue. Has a fairly dry finish.
Overall - Nice hop flavors that balance well with the smoky malt. Easy to drink despite the high ABV."
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,4.31,"Clear, very dark brown, near black with a substantial foamy tan head that persists and produces some nice lacing.
The aroma is pine resin and caramel with some notes of raisin and plum.
The taste is dark roast malt, pine, caramel, plums, coffee and dark chocolate with a lingering dark roast bitterness that outlasts the hops, very bold and robust.
The body is solidly medium, very smooth, good carbonation level.

Taste - like the smell, chocolate coconut milk poured over oat bran
Feel - thick and creamy
Overall - great and interesting"
Coconut Vibes,4.47,"Pours black with a still look. It has oily legs as you swirl the glass. Aroma is coconut water and soy sauce. Toasted coconut, chocolate, caramel, and roasty and toasty malts all come thru, leaning lightly towards 'sweet'. Flavor profile is the same, big coconut water mixed in with hearty toasty and roasty malts. Chocolate comes on at the finish. Soy sauce permeates the middle, distracting a touch from the rest of the profile. Mouth feel is thick, creamy, and decadent. Overall, big and bold, with a clear and intentional focus on coconut, as the label would suggest. It's a soothing pillow of coconut.

Poured from a 750mL bottle. Reviewed from notes."
Coconut Vibes,4.1,"750ml bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace on the glass. It smelled strongly of coconut, chocolate, molasses, toffee and caramel. Lots of chocolate and coconut taste. This beer became sweeter and sweeter as I drank it. A little cloying."
Coconut Vibes,4.7,"2021 release - Drank on 12/25/21.
Tastes like a chocolate fudge mounds bar. Incredible thickness and mouthful, few brewers seem to achieve. Sweet, but so well balanced without the coconut overpowering. The absolute best non-ba stout I’ve had to date"
Coconut Vibes,4.66,"750ml bottle at share. Inky black pour, ring of beige head. Aroma is coconut, chocolate, roasty, nutty. Taste pronounces the almonds a bit more, with plenty of lush coconut and chocolate flavors to nail the Almond Joy vibe. Superb!"
Coconut Vibes,4.75,"This is by far the thickest stout I have ever had, as crazy as that may sound. It’s like darn motor oil! It’s is very tasty, smells great and is well worth being a top 250!"
Coconut Vibes,4.78,"Most recent batch poured into a tulip. Motor oil viscosity. Completely opaque. Coats the glass. Tons of dark chocolate and toasted coconut. On the sweeter side but really phenomenal. Super mouth coating. Very thick. Low carb. Overall, this was outstanding. One of the best non ba coconut stouts I’ve ever had."
Coconut Vibes,4.75,Blend #3 version poured from the bottle into a snifter. So happy to be able to try this after getting in trade from another BA. Wonderfully thick with a hint of booze and LOTS of coconut.
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.65,"Appearance - The beer was solid black in appearance with little carbonation rising to the tan head.

Smell - The nose was very coffee forward with the barrel being detectable as well. It was not overly sweet.

Taste - At the front, there was a generous taste of coffee. It was blended with a soft chocolate presence. There was a sweetness that brought to mind marshmallow or vanilla, but it was not overly sweet or cloying. Tour the back, the sweetness combined with the mellowed heat of the bourbon.

Mouthfeel - The feel was soft and slick, with light carbonation.

Overall - This was a well designed beer that I would welcome the opportunity to sample again."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.56,"Look - black and thick with a nice tan head

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,3.89,"Bottle generously shared by Tony. Dark brown pour with a brown head. All kinds of coffee notes, with dark roasted malts, and bourbon highlights. There is definitely an off note here. Good body with an average mouthfeel."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,4.65,"Great beer with a stellar coffee profile. Look and mouthfeel leave a bit to be desired, but the beer makes up for it with a coffee-forward nose and flavor that is superior to the majority of beers in this style. The barrel comes through as well."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,5,"26 November 2020 - Beer #209 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade
Current Rank: #31 on Beer Advocate

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 5 - I'm constantly impressed with AleSmith nailing the ratios. It's perfect stout:barrel:coffee.

Taste: 5 - ditto. Each part complements the other two perfectly. The coffee lingers on the back end very pleasantly.

Mouth: 5 - silky smooth. Slightly thick, but like velvet going down.

Overall: 5 - absolutely lives up to the hype.

Cheers!"
La Fin Du Monde,3.58,"Hazy and golden, huge head dies at moderate rate, sits there at low level for a hot minute. Smell is good, nice hops. I don’t like this beer’s flavor, something off putting as with most Unibroue products, not sure what it is. Average feel and finish. Would rather not drink again."
La Fin Du Monde,4.25,"This was made in Belgium, right? Wait—Canada? Ok, so it is the best Belgian style beer ever made in Canada. Full stop. Deserves all the accolades and popularity."
La Fin Du Monde,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep and rich orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 10. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong and complex aromas of orange citrus, bread, bananas, and Belgian spices. A candied sweetness underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread notes, a sweet yeast that leaves flavors of citrus, grapes, banana, and Belgian spices of clove and coriander. A light astringency. Then a sweet and bready finish.

Feel: A heavier-body. Strong carbonation and yeast. A soft, full mouthfeel. Surprisingly clean for the sweet body. (4.25+)

Overall: A top-of-the-line Tripel here. I haven't had a good one in a while. This one reminded me what I was missing. Authentic. Nails the aromas and flavors. A nice balance of citrus, banana, and bread spice. A full, soft, yet clean mouthfeel. All aspects are top tier here. (Rating: 4.30)"
La Fin Du Monde,4.7,Fantastic
La Fin Du Monde,4.17,"L: Hazy, glowing golden body with a dense, even head.
S: Soft and sweet. Cracker, pear, honey, apricot, and faint spices.
T: Less soft. A burst of citrus, then floral hops; apricot, yeast, sweet in the body, hints of spice, and bready, woody notes on the finish.
F: High carbonation, with a very dry finish.
O: It’s a great beer, but the best tripel out there? I suspect there are better."
La Fin Du Monde,5,Beautiful golden color with amazing surge of carbonation sweetness and bitterness level each other out throughout the whole sit on the most perfectly balanced triples I’ve ever had in my life. cheers!
La Fin Du Monde,4.27,"Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip.

Lightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention.

Sweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well.

Palate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.

Medium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.

While lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available."
La Fin Du Monde,4.02,"Hits all the marks for a tripel. Flavor profile seems a touch on the bold side, perhaps to suit the North American palate."
La Fin Du Monde,4.49,"Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle.
Pouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass.
The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway.
First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation.
Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip.
the flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze."
La Fin Du Monde,3.93,"Poured from 12oz bottle

The look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.

The aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.

The flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.

Feel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.

Overall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel."
La Fin Du Monde,4.59,"A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should"
La Fin Du Monde,4.18,"Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.

Spices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.

The flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold!

Surprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.

Due to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.

Overall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style."
La Fin Du Monde,4.76,"Deep orangish-yellow, white head, decent retention and lace
Pear eau de vie, pepper, cloves, green banana, green peach, vanilla aromas
Pretty much tastes like it smells, minus the vanilla, peppery finish
Light bodied with appropriate carbonation
Forgot how good this is"
La Fin Du Monde,4.83,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a dark & hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs.
S - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well.
T - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise.
F - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle!
O - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle."
La Fin Du Monde,5,"Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced.

In the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed.

Palate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience

Finish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale.

While this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience.
This is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating."
Atrial Rubicite,4.4,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022

Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.

Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.

Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout."
Atrial Rubicite,4.9,"#94, good stuff!"
Atrial Rubicite,4.49,"Look - Love the thick raspberry puree look
Smell - great raspberry tartness
Taste - fantastic raspberries with it being tart but not overly tart
Feel - medium full body and a littler carb but still really nice
Overall - just delicious"
Atrial Rubicite,4.27,"Deep purple color with good lacing. Lots of raspberries in the taste, with some earthiness as well as farmhouse taste. Solid beer, and definitely tasty!"
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.99,Nice whiskey barrel flavors compliment a base ale.
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Muddy brown strong ale, no head whatsoever, and absolutely no more disappointment after that. Great silky mouthfeel, vanilla flavor mildly allowing bourbon and even brandy notes to overtake it. Nice caramel malt finish, smooth from top of the glass to the bottom. Brandy flavor is more at the top, bourbon predominant through last sip. Superior effort!"
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,"2009 Vintage courtesy of acurtis.
(12 years old!)
Dark fruits,(prune, raisins), toffee, leather, wood, slight oxidization.
99% flat. No booziness. Smooth.
Overall: Though definitely old, this ages pretty well. Those melded flavors only age can produce. Ages better than most beers out there. From what I’ve read Lost Abbey was probably flat even when fresh."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,"The Angel’s Share is from 2016. Pours dark, dark brown. Almost black. Very little carbonation during the pour, and then a bit after it was all poured. Immediate aroma of bourbon. I was surprised it was so strong after 4-5 years. Taste follows - big bourbon presence, which makes me happy, because I love bourbon barrel aged beers. Between the color being almost black and the bourbon dominating, this is very close to a bourbon barrel aged stout instead of a barleywine. If given in a blind tasing I might think it was. There’s very little barleywine characteristic: it’s not sweet, don’t get any caramel or toffee. It’s still a bit boozy, but I like that in beers like this."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.16,"Viscous, opaque garnet-brown with no head; strong bourbon nose with hints of wood, cherry stone, candy sugar, moss, plum and oak smoke; fig, milk chocolate, red currants, a whisky hit with a big thread of vanilla, sweet comeback + warming end; medium-full, chewy, round.

3.75 4.5 4 4 4.25

Sat on this for 5 years.
No looker, but smells like a humidor - once you get past the booziness, the complexity of the aroma drips down the back of your throat.
The taste is dried dark fruit more than any caramel sweetness. And then that bourbon drops in… while among the most harmonious I’ve encountered, it does take over more than complement the base beer.
Not perfect: it’s flat + boozy - hard to avoid at 12.5%, but it should've mellowed with age. I see lots of good ratings for this, but some are a decade old - maybe this beer jumped out more before everything was getting put in barrels.
Overall, this has more in common with treacly English strong ales than anything else. But with a lot of bourbon.

More an advertisement for bourbon barrel aging than a complete beer."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,"Cork didn't want to get out, no pop. Pours dark brown, flat. Smells bourbon. Smooth mouthfeel, but could do with some carb. No alcohol to speak of. Taste is dry, woody, with some bice bourbon. Bit herbal, that old leather tobacco flavour from good barrels"
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.31,"Vintage 2016. Poured into a tulip glass. No head to speak of, just a full murky ruby brown. Aromas of fig,barrel, and caramel. Taste is similar, no hops semblance at this point. And that is ...Ok. I’ll give you six dollars if you can name where that quote came from. The heft was surprisingly light, carbonation low, mildly sticky as everything warmed. Delicious and coating."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,"vintage 2016 poured from a 375mL corked & caged bottle into a snifter. pours light brown but gathers in the glass a bit darker, almost chestnut, with the tiniest amount of khaki colored head that dissipates leaving small khaki swirls. nose is a combination of dark fruit, figs, toffee, chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. taste is a little more oak and bourbon forward followed by sweet toffee and caramel. it suffers from a little oxidation but that’s my own fault for letting this sit so long. mouthfeel is medium to full. it sits on the tongue fairly full then finishes a little thinner. overall, pretty stellar bourbon barrel-aged barleywine. need to track down a fresh vintage as it was not my intention to try this for the first time with so much age on it. very much enjoyed it though."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,"2014 Bottled

Consumed on April 13, 2019.

I pulled the cork slowly to only a slight release of air. No pop.

Brown, large and very loosely packed bubbles, indicating low carbonation. They disappeared very quickly. Dark brown color. Translucent and slightly murky.

This beer has a huge nose. Bourbon, chocolate, toasted coconut, vanilla, oak. Tons of dark, dried fruit including raisins and prunes. Coffee. A hint of cinnamon. Some ABV coming Through.

Lots of chocolate. Notes of sweet and dark over the course of the glass. Chocolate covered, bourbon soaked raisins and cherries. Some cinnamon. Some oak.

A medium body with no carbonation. Pleasant warmth from the 12.5% ABV and a semi-sweet finish with some woody bitterness. Residual, sticky sweetness coats my lips.

I am really enjoying this beer. There is tons of chocolate and dark dried fruit that comes through as chocolate covered cherries and raisins. I pulled this from the basement at 55-60F and put it in the fridge for about 30 mins. This beer has held up beautifully. Has it improved? Based only on my ratings from 14 and 15 I am enjoying this MUCH more, but there are too many variables to say it has improved. Right here, right now, I think it’s excellent. There is definitely some heat, which I think works nicely."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.32,"Pours a medium to dark brown with mahogany highlights. Thin tan ring of head, no lacing present. Really looks like rusty tap water. Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla, malts and dark fruits. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, caramel malts oak, raisins, figs molasses and toffee. Medium bodied for the style, minimal carbonation, syrupy mouth feel. An awesome sipper."
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.59,2016 version. Absolutely phenomenal and incredibly complex! Not much booze to speak of at this age which really lets the deep character of this brew to really shine through. Been wanting to try this forever now and somehow it just always slipped through my fingers but now that I've had it I get all the hype surrounding it. One of the very best beers I've ever had. Period.

The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.24,"Dark brown with a murky ruby tinge and no head.

Smells of your typical english barley wine 'stinky foot' and bourbon barrel. Caramel, cherries, and butterscotch.

Tastes of caramel toffee, stinky foot, bourbon barrel, and a butter scotch finish.

Medium, syrupy body with a moderate carbonation.

I got this in Chico, and am drinking it Jan 26th, 2019. Very smooth, very well crafted and thoughtfully done brew."

L: Cloudy viscous dark mahogany brown pour. No head or lacing worth mentioning.

S: Sweet caramel and toffee... bourbon and booze.

T/F: Sweet and thick... big time dark sugars... caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Very boozy... almost overpowering. Warming... unbalanced on the sweet side. Rich and ABV not all that well hidden.

O: I wanted to like this more. It's quality, don't get me wrong... but too sweet/boozy and lacking the depth/balance I was expecting. Very glad I got to try it... but honestly not one I'd seek out again."

Good beer"
The Angel's Share - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.53,"This is a wonderful drinking experience! I had aged this beer for over 2 years prior to drinking it. The beer pours dark brown, with minimal head. The aroma is one of the most complex and pleasant I have ever experienced. There are hints of blackberry, or currant, with an subtle earthy aroma. The taste is totally different from the aroma - malty, hints of raisin on the front, with a subtle and pleasant flavor of oak and vanilla on the back-end. This is a beer to sip and enjoy for an extended period of time. As the beer got warmer, the flavors only got richer. If you find it on the shelf - pick it up!"
Liberty Ale,3.91,">BIAS ALERT<
I'm not a big fan of West coast IPAs.
Some are good. Most aren't.

Now to the Liberty Ale!

Poured a BEAUTIFUL color of a polished piece of amber. Lots of bubbles. Head stuck around for 5+ minutes. Nice lacing! Taste is strictly that Cascade Hops taste, not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. Nice carbonation! Not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like I've experienced with some beers (Rebel Rouser, Ranger IPA, Torpedo). Definitely a nice, refreshing brew.

Overall I think it's a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq."
Liberty Ale,4.06,"I like this beer, I picked up a 12 ounce can at my local La,bodega and noticed right off the bat that it was crisp/clean..

I poured a 12 ounce can into my 16 ounce Belgium tulip glass, and got a nice 1 1/2 finger head with a beautiful copper glow...This is a nice beer because it's a traditional straightforward ale... I don't have to worry about chill haze, and white chunks floating around in it like all these other millenial, HAZY, IPA's I've been running into lately...

Nice and crisp..That means alot these day's for me...This beer has a very safe, clean beer taste, that I will definitely keep my eyes open for in the future...Definitely will make it's way into my rotation..I love this Ale..."
Liberty Ale,4.12,"Liberty Ale is a crisp, solid, toasted session IPA classic that has really stood out over the years. Liberty Ale is clean, medium-bodied, well-filtered & to this day one of my favorite daily drinkers. My refrigerator almost always has a six pack of Liberty Ale in it.

I really enjoy the hop profile of this beer. To me, Liberty Ale is the epitome of a West Coast IPA. I live in the Northeast and we have an absolutely horrendous assortment of Anchor beer on the shelves at most grocery stores such as Wegmans or ShopRite. Unfortunately, Anchor's sales reps just don't get the job done here in New England.

Every time I'm out in San Francisco I make sure to imbibe on all of the wonderful bruise that we miss out on from Anchor, here in the Northeast."
Liberty Ale,3.92,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, there is no ""best by"" date that I can find.

APPEARANCE: Pours a clear, copper color with one-finger off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a nice looking beer.

SMELL: Sweet bread and flowery, subtle to the nose.

TASTE: Initially sweet honey and then a flowery hop profile that lingered in a good way.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: this is a mild tasting IPA by today's standards but I really enjoyed having it, hard to believe it was being brewed in the dark ages of beer in 1975, I would buy this again no problem and would recommend to anyone who likes craft beer."
Liberty Ale,3.86,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy eggshell white head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Herbal spicy pine, citrus zest, floral notes, lightly toasty bready malt, and just a touch of sweeetness.

T: Classic Cascade hops in their purest form, spicy pine, citrus zest, grapefruit and lemon, floral notes, slightly toasty bready malt, and a pretty much bone dry finish wit only the lightest touch of malt sweetness.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: Was intending for this to be a revisit because I was finally able to find a fresh bottle, but it looks like I've never logged it on here, so...
It might not have all the flash of today's IPAs, but you can see why it grabbed people's attention back in the day and has been brewed ever since. Respect the classics."
Liberty Ale,3.71,"Look: Clear, dark gold. Half a finger of bubbly white head with decent retention.

Smell: Floral. I can smell lavender and orange peel.

Taste: Begins with a floral hop taste, followed by medium hop bitterness that lingers for a bit. Very mild sweet malt at the back that's hard to detect.

Mouthfeel: Slightly thin, with very high carbonation.

Overall: This definitely feels like one of America's first post-Prohibition forays into the IPA. It's historic, but still lacking the punch and complexity of the modern beverage."
Liberty Ale,3.81,Poured a clear orange amber color with a two finger white head t hat dissipated quickly to a thin film. Moderate lacing. Peach/apricot nose. Taste follows the nose with added hop forward flavor and pronounced on the finish. Refreshing. Moderate body and carbonation.
Liberty Ale,4.33,"Loving the bottle, beautiful.

Reminds me of being in Belgium.

Top notch head and colour. Mega citrussy aroma. Really refreshing, as much as any beer I have had before ever.

Phenominal for summer in the sun. It's winter, f u c k."
Liberty Ale,3.83,"Smells like it's going to be sweet at first, then the floral hops come through.

Taste wise this is really nice, one of the more balanced IPAs i've had. I could drink more than one of these without getting overwhelmed with the style (unlike many other IPAs)."
Hennepin,3.98,great taste of a European farm house ale slightly sour
Hennepin,4.02,"Awesome saison that most people could pick up and enjoy. Love the color on this and the foam sticks around forever. Bright, orangey taste with a bit of ginger, some delightful malty sweetness. Smell is a bit off-putting: very sour and yeasty, a bit funky. But it's a very pleasing drink, would definitely get it again. Ommegang is consistently excellent"
Hennepin,4.13,"This was actually pretty close to excellent for me, great floral notes, grassy underpinnings and a good citrus finish. I liked this one more than I thought I would"
Hennepin,4,"Expected a little more from this brew for the price and the rating. enjoyed the carbonation (akin to with a semisweet sparkling wine mouthfeel), but overall it tasted too much like booze and spices. I got mine from a 4-pack at a grocery, so maybe a draft experience would be different. Might seek out again."
Hennepin,4.21,"Nice golden color with a real lively foam head.
Great spicy notes to the nose like clove, nutmeg.
Nice spice on the palate, slight funk and bitterness. And the carbonation is good.
Can't go wrong drinking ommegang."
Hennepin,4.44,"A refreshing great. Had a version from the brewery years ago aged in the Howe caverns. Still a marvelous, refreshing citrusy, hoppy joy. 750 ml bottles that work in a Weiss beer glass. There is a tang to this that is hard to describe but is akin to the unique characters of a Weiss beer. A beautiful head that lingers and a slight opaque look make this stand out from the average crystal clear beers you might be used to. If you have an adventurous spirit and are willing to leave the lager swill behind, get a bottle."
Hennepin,4.52,"Review 1529

My continuing quest for the best has to lead me to this beer. I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles.

I first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.

The flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect.

The mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy.

The body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish.

This beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing. The hops are subtle but firm giving away to the spice addition in the beer. If I could get this beer, it would be a staple in my beer fridge."
Hennepin,4.49,"Had a few beers from this brewery always with great results.
Golden amber color. Scent and taste of orange, ginger and slight banana.
Overall very impressive beer. Will look for more of the beer soon"
Hennepin,3.79,"Appearance: Upon opening the glass, it is billowing out of the bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy (~40%), medium golden/orange color that has sediment floating around in it. A strong white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread and cracker malts upfront. This follows into a banana and clove ester quality. A bit of banana bread and Belgian spice. Some juicyfruit, but ultimately it smells malty. (3.75)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more bready malts upfront. Cracker, bread, and then follows into a Belgian spices of clove and banana. This linger and provides a tart and spicy pepper astringency before it finishes with a sweet, almost candied malt finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finishes soft on the palate.

Compared to Boulevard's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale 4/16/21: Pours a more orange color with a milder head. More bready, clove, and banana malts. Less fruit, citrus, coriander, and yeast. Winner: Tank 7

Overall: A pretty good farmhouse ale/sasion. I wanted to see how this one compared to one of my favorite saisons, which is Tank 7. I think I prefer the Tank 7. This is a decent beer, but as other have mentioned its leans more malty, bready, and sweet. The clove, banana, and pepper spice show here. Overall, not as good as I expected, and drinks pretty average. (Final Rating: 3.79)"
Hennepin,4.48,"Bottle with Best By date 07/03/22
Ah.... one of my first beer-loves, back in ancient times, c. December '97. Somehow I haven't reviewed it , & have to admit, slightly intimidated to do it now. How to do it justice? Will the ""objective #s measure up to my overall impression of it? Hmmmm??? OK, here goes :

Translucent gold-ish orange, with a huge forever head , that leaves a thick ring , substantial surface covering, and sheets of lacing . (Or it would, if I could hold off on drinking for a few more minutes - trust me - that's what happens. ;) )

Smell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove, ""spicy"" [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of ""fresh"" [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, & Berliners. Just better than the usual.

Taste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, & leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, & slightly stripped.

Overall, as you might guess, I am astounded & enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , & could use 3-4 more months on it. If memory serves, I'd give the ""Taste"" rating another +.25, in that ideal state. ('Course, that might just have been the abv X [#beers] being the voices in my head. ;) In any event, if you haven't tried this, please, do yourself a favor, & go for it. (& for Dog's sake, don't drink it ice-cold - let it warm up to 45-50F , or so. :) )"
Hennepin,3.68,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a thick white head. Funky aromas. Sharp carbonation and medium to heavy bodied. There’s a good saison flavor under there, but it’s masked a bit by the coriander and ginger. Maybe it’s just a personal flavor preference, but these flavors just don’t quite seem to go with the style."
Hennepin,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stem glass.
Strong 2-finger head when poured. Some decent lacing on the glass and nice lingering thin head on beer while drinking it down.
Strong copper color filled with carbonation bubbling to the top to keep that thin head going.
Coriander and spice right away invite you to take a drink.
Sparkling mouthfeel as soon as you take a drink and that smooths out at the end.
As described on Omegang's website, you can taste the coriander, spice, and orange peel for a really delightful beer drinking experience.
Overall, this is everything you want in a 'traditional' Saison- I fell in love with everything Omegang brewed years ago when Belgian beers became popular. It's so nice to revisit an old friend and put up a review on ba. I strongly recommend this beer any time of the year. I can't wait to try Omegang's newer offerings!"
Hennepin,4.63,Awesome farmhouse saison.
Hennepin,4.64,"I received a case of 750ml bottles for my wedding 21 years ago.
We drank one on our 10th year anniversary.
It held up vary well. I was amazed
I still have 2 bottles left cellaring.
Don't know when or if I'll ever open them.
Great beer!"
Hennepin,4.06,"Nice golden color, thick head, nice lacing. Smells sour, fermented wheat. Smell throws you off, it tastes nothing like it smells. Very smooth. Notes of orange, barley, spices, ginger. Nothing too pronounced, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with medium-light viscosity. Overall, it doesn't smell good but it excels in most other categories. Excellent brew"
Hennepin,4.46,"This beer has a beautiful, rich taste on poor. It has a succulent, foamy head with a light amber color. The aroma is not all that apparent. However, the taste is really good. It's crisp and refreshing, especially during a pandemic on a hot, humid day in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I don't smell or taste much in the way of orange peel or the coriander. However, the coriander taste is subtle but clearly there. This beer is refreshing. Even with a 6.5% ABV it's not heavy. A must true."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.1,"Murky brown with a finger of tan head. Great retention and lacing for the style.

Strong fig in the nose with a little raisin and orange peel. Some earthy hops behind.

The fruit is present, but less forward in the taste, coupled with vanilla and some strong alcohol and hop bitterness for balance.

Full bodied and chewy with tight carbonation.

Really enjoyable. American barleywines aren’t always my favorite, but this has nice depth and contrasting flavors."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.41,"Barrel Aged Behemoth pours a dark brown color, with a small tan head. Aroma is filled with oak and sweet brown sugar. Flavor is oak, sweet brown sugar, and a hint of caramel; very smooth. Good body and feel."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.54,"12oz bottle into a BiL glass.

L: Muddy reddish brown body topped by a perfect finger of dense tan head that displays great retention and lacing. Gorgeous foam but an uninspiring body.

S: Rich caramel pops as the core aroma, with orange marmalade, whiskey, and vanilla performing admirably in supporting roles. Some brown sugar and barrel char combine into a terrific crème brûlée overtone. Fantastic!

T: Candied citrus, toffee, baker’s chocolate, and barrel. The hoppiness of the base has resolved nicely into the upfront citrus and the bitter chocolate flavor toward the tail end, with the malt and barrel maintaining
dominance in the center of the palate. Tons going on, with the bulk of it great.

F: Lively medium body with tons of soft effervescence. Maybe a bit less richness than ideal, but quite pleasant.

O: Excellent example of a barrel-aged American Barleywine. Very glad it’s no long a brewery-only $35 bomber! Beers of Fame tick 216/250.

Cheers!"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.35,"A - Pours a clear dark amber with a thin white head. Nice amount of light soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is vanilla, burnt sugar and bourbon.

T - The taste is vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, raisins, dates, earthy hops and finish with a good amount of bourbon barrel.

M - Medium body with low carbonation. Soft mouthfeel with a still dry finish.

O - Really tasty BBA Barleywine. Unbelievably drinkable for being 13.6%."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.21,"12oz bottle; 13.6% ABV
thanks to Ken for the bottle

F: full body, lower carbonation, boozy and sweeter finish
O: really good beer - thanks Ken!"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.37,"Pours dark brown. Smells of bourbon and sweet malts. Love that aroma. Taste is a bit sweet, and the bourbon barrel is present without being overpowering. Maybe some figs going on here. Mouthfeel is fantastic. Super creamy. Great barrel aged barleywine."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.49,"Looks murky and dense.

Smells is delicious. Reminds me so much of firestone sucuba but more potent and sweet. Absolutely no question this is American style with the mustiness of the hops.

Taste and feel. Oh yeah. This may be the best American barleywine I've had. Its got the hop presence you expect but it is not at all bitter. Remarkable beer really. It taste like caramel covered hops. But now that I say that not excessively sweet either. Certainly less sweet than an English. Just an absolute perfect intermingling of rich, toffee, toasted nuttiness and fruity flavors bouncing off earthy herbaceous floral notes. The bourbon is HUGE..LIKE REALLY MASSIVE. This beer hides absolutely zero percent of its 14%.

Overall... absolutely world class and this is 3 months old. I could drink this as is every day...having said that I want to drink this with 10 years on it... there are few beers I feel actually improve with age but I'd bet the bank the bank this one does for my palate. Looks like I'm ISO some more of these."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.94,"It's difficult to read the text over the logo. With the aid of a light, it says: ""BOTTLED 01-17-22 3778""

Aroma; It has a strong aroma of toffee, brown sugar, and wet wood. There are notes of molasses and Fig Newton. The aroma is really wonderful. There is a light bit of alcohol that creeps in from time to time but the general experience is more than enjoyable.

Taste: Brown sugar and dates come through up front. There is this very sweet flavor with a mix of lightly browned raisin bran toast. It is full of robust and enjoyable flavors. There are raisins there which are really wonderful. There is a light bit of alcohol.

Mouthfeel: It is thick and chewy with a slight burnt bitterness. It feels a bit overly thick but what is there works well with the flavors in the beer.

Overall: As a whole the beer is a more thick and full-bodied beer but it also does a very good job supporting the interesting and flavorful characteristics of the beer which consist of brown breads, dried fruits, molasses and molasses-sugars, and slightly sweeter dates, raisins, and prunes. The label doesn't seem to indicate what the ABV is but it seems very sweet. I would definitely like to try this beer again if there were some way to tell what the ABV was because while the flavors and aromas seem good the beer feels too sweet for a Barleywine. It's worth recommending because it is interesting, although it does feel overly sweet."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.79,"Pours a fizzy foamy 1/2 finger head with med retention fair soapy lacing, dark hazy chestnut brown color

Nose sweet malt, candy malt with caramel, sticky toffee, nutty and touch of nougat, light vanilla, a bit of sweet bourbon, fair fruity, light spicy hops

Taste brings more sweet malt, candy, caramel, toffee, rock candy sugar, a touch nutty, fair spicy earthy hop bitterness but balanced, light winey oxidation aging, mild bourbon and vanilla barrel, fair alcohol, touch of dark red fruit, spicy hop finish

Mouth is med to fuller bod, med to lighter frothy carb, fair warning alcohol

Overall eh, OK barleywine but nothing special, and bourbon barrel didn't add much although it did round the hops a bit, but not a huge fan of this beer in general"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.33,"Look - fantastic reddish brown with a great head and incredible rimming slight lacing
Smell - caramel toffee barrel and a great rye smel
Taste caramel toffee slight dark fruit, fantastic barrel
Feel - medium full body slight fizz carb
Overall - really great"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.96,"Bottled on 12/29/21. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours a murky and hazy brown; fluffy light khaki head that fades leaving decent retention and lacing.

The aromas are malt forward. Lots of caramel. Some toffee and dark fruits. It smells like your traditional barleywine but the bourbon basically goes unnoticed in the aroma department.

The flavors follow the nose. More sticky caramel and toffee. Some chocolate and cocoa. More dark fruits. Lots of raisins. Some citrus in the mix, especially lemon. The bourbon is on the subtle side. Some oak and wood coming through. Some rye and black pepper in the mix giving this one a subtle spiciness. Moderate to low bitterness. Solid sweetness. Strong malt backbone. It finishes a little warm and the alcohol is slightly noticeable, but in a good way. This one makes for a nice sipper.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate to low carbonation. It's thick, slick and fluffy.

This is a pretty nice barleywine. The bourbon characteristics are noticeable in the flavor department but they aren't the star. It's hard to tell whether it's the bourbon coming through or if it's just a big beer. Either way it's a nice classic and traditional example of the barleywine style."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.25,Smells and tastes like sweet caramel candy bourbon.
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.69,"Poured into snifter. Thick syrupy caramel color, cream colored body.

Sugary malty bourbon sweet nose.

Caramel, both milk chocolate and vanilla, very sweet. The spicy hops and some peach and pear notes come through as it warms.

Early on I feared this wouldn't distinguish itself from any other bourbon barrel beer (not necessarily a bad thing). This is a very good ale and to be savored."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.2,"Pours a dark amber color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has hop and malt hints
The taste follows the nose with a pleasant hop and bittersweet malt flavor
A medium bodied very well carbonated beer
A good Barleywine"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.72,"On tap at Dominion Wine and Beer.

T - Not too much bitterness. More English than American barley wine to me. Lots of malty caramel, brown sugar, and also barrel oak and vanilla.

MF - Very warming on the palate and in the gut.

Probably a bit too much barrel for me. I like the base beer to be the star of the show."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.39,"2022 batch.

Poured deep copper color with little head
Smells of malt, brown sugar, raisins, vanilla. `
Definitely taste the barrel. Vanilla and slight sweetness comes out as it warms. Hops are there too, but not prominent.
Nice mouthfeel as it is not cloying at all.
Very drinkable. Not as sweet or as thick as some. Nice flavors. Good, dry finish."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,3.82,"12FL OZ bottle
Served in a snifter

This beer pours brown and is topped with a minimal head.

Caramelized sugar, brown sugar, figs, dates, and alcohol all seem to be prominent aromas.

the taste is similar. But as it warms, I get some caramel and vanilla flavors. Less booziness than the smell indicated. The other things that I smelled are there in the taste.

Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel

This beer is much better as it approaches room temperature."
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.34,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This monster pours a muddled orange
tinged brown with a decent head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring,
thin light film, and shows subtle lacing. Nose of bourbon, oak, coconut,
sticky hops, butterscotch, toffee, and vanilla. Flavors surpass the nose
with fig, cherry, oak, coconut, vanilla, toffee, sticky pine laden hops, orange
zest, and touches of brandy. Nice mouth feel; medium body, smooth,
rich, lightly coating, warming, boozy, low carbonation, and a rich sweet and
bitter hop touched balanced finish that is medium dry.

overall---solid

Cheers"
Barrel Aged Behemoth,4.4,"Bottled 12/30/21 Glad I get to try the first one ""fresh"", looking forward to seeing how they develop over time.

Drinking great right out of the gate. The hops are muted after 12-16 months in the barrel but an earthy remnant remains. Stewed, booze soaked raisins, sticky caramel, and plenty of smooth booze are all here in wonderful harmony. The finish adds a nice oaky tingle. The body is full and lush. Bought a case without every trying this before. Looking forward to the next 23."
Abbey Ale,4.1,World class dubbel made right in the USA.
Abbey Ale,3.91,"Pours a muddy copper with just over a finger of head. The nose is mildly funky and malty with a touch of raisin essence. The flavor follows the nose with a long dry finish.

There is not quite enough malty sweetness to make this great, so I'll just say that it is pretty good."
Abbey Ale,4.24,"Why did it take so long for me to try Ommegang's cherry double.
a) Cherry, mahogany pour to form.
s) Up there with Chimay, Duval and co.
t) More cherry, more sweet, heart wood, shellac, cedar, spice, woodshop.
f) Never cloying, sweet but cleans up nicely, lovely, lively tongue feel.
o) Outstanding and next to Belgians"
Abbey Ale,4.34,"Solid copper appearance with a large tan head and good lacing. Malty aroma serves as a backdrop for an array of dark, ripe fruit. Complex taste rolling out notes of ripe fruit, licorice, seasonal spices and caramel. Alcohol a bit more noticeable in the aftertaste. Medium-to-full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel leading to a dry, spicy finish."
Abbey Ale,4.39,"I love Belgian style beer and like golden monkey, Abbey Ale delivers

Color is ruby, with a great head upon the pour. I smelled figs and currant. The taste very much the same.

Had Neon Rainbows from the same producer and have learned if they do one great most are great. There a few exceptions"
Abbey Ale,4.75,"Historic, many occasions. SO good, malty, yeasty, maple sweetness, like pure maple. Dark stone fruits, cherry. Delish!"
Abbey Ale,3.83,"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV was 8.5%. Beautiful copper to ruby colour, decent head. Intense oaky, malty and vinous aroma and flavour. Good beer."
Abbey Ale,4.71,"A malty and complex dark beer.
Tons of spice and malty smell. Color is deep amber. Has a big head with creamy bubbles.
Might be too heavy for a dubble but it is really good. I feel like this one beats Three Philosophers in complexity, smell and taste.
My favorite from Ommegang so far."
Abbey Ale,4,Pours golden brown. Over a finger of head. Dark fruit to the nose. Some bitterness upfront that goes away for a very good finish.
Abbey Ale,3.84,"I don't usually review this sort of thing because I drink out of the bottle but because it is an imitation of a Belgian Dubbel it foamed up and would have had a huge head... a lot like me but I'm not a Belgian knock off. I have to slurp up the foam to keep it from overflowing like champagne and like champagne the foam wash fruity and light.

Initially it smells like a white or blush whine but then a bit of malt comes through.

The taste is like other trappist beers I've had. It's extremely fruity with just a little malt and then some bitterness. Like some kind of sparkling wine/beer mix.

It's very foamy and smooth with a ton of soft carbonation. It's finish is lasting fruit and bitterness.

Overall it's much like a few other Belgian Trappist dubbels, trippels and quads I've had. It's the best of those though. I would give it a 4.7 out of 6 as a beer but for the style it would get a 5.7."
Abbey Ale,4.31,"This is the one that got me on my Belgian Beer quest - so it always met with preconceived expectations - C'est la Vie....Classic Belgian style Dubbel with Ommegang's twist (yeast strain)...go to local brewery, to me..."
Abbey Ale,3.4,"12 oz bottle .
Tulip glass .

Pours 1.5 fingers off white/tan ,soapy head, dissipates quickly, leaving slight lace around glass ,
Color is ruby red .

Smell is- fruity-cherry-currents,with earthy hop and hint of clove .

Taste- strong notes of pepper-corriander hint of orange zest, malt and cherry .

Finish is -creamy, medium carbonation with a nice spicy finish on the tongue.

Overall very tasty for a high ABV beer- no alcohol bite to speak of-love the peppery bite and hints of stone fruit. I'll definitely look for this one again.

Two thumbs up to the brewers!"
Abbey Ale,4.27,"Pours deep garnet with an ample tan head with ample lacing and carbonation. Aroma and taste is that of dried fruits and brown sugar. Finish is dry and smooth. Not as sweet as some of the Belgians that I have tried recently, but this is very good and in the conversation with those great brews. An outstanding beer from Ommegang and reasonably priced!"
Abbey Ale,2.91,"Dry, malty, and really dry. Not a beer I will look for."
Abbey Ale,4.5,"Exceptional quality of flavors and textures in this beer. This is Ommegang doing what it does best - really solid, perfectly crafted, mostly traditional style Belgian ales. This beer is warm and inviting while also being vibrant with ripe dark fruit flavors. The maltiness is smooth and the flavors linger. Delicious. yb"
Abbey Ale,4.42,"L: 12oz bottle into a tall, straight-sided glass. Three fingers of dense light-brown foam atop a clear ruby-brown body. Strong retention but only light lacing. Very nice.

S: Good balance of bready malt (pumpernickel?) and fruit. Complex fruitiness, with hints of cherry, red grape, and plum. Some distant peppery spice. Restrained and interesting.

T: Follows the nose, but with more intensity: sweet malt up front, with rich fruit and spice toward the back end. Grape, fig, and some nice nuttiness as well. Dry, yeasty finish with just a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious and nuanced.

F: Medium-bodied and hugely effervescent. Suits the style.

O: Delicious beer, and by far the most authentically Belgian-tasting American version of the style I've ever tried. I'd take this over Chimay Red 10 times out of 10. If it has a flaw, it's that it's a bit boozy for the style, but that's to be expected with its 8.2% ABV. Beer of Fame tick 177/250. Cheers!"
Double Nelson,4.46,"16oz can dated 9/15/21.

Pours hazy gold with a half inch head of white. Moderate retention and lacing. Dank, wild grapes in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel. Juicy, resinous citrus on the palate with minimal malt and a medium bitterness. Pineapple, white grapes, and papaya. Finishes fairly dry but juicy and wildly dank."
Double Nelson,4.43,"Immense thank you to jrc1093 for this one. I've always wanted to try this little Kiwi bastard.

12oz can - dated 10/06/20 - poured into an ale stem at 40°F.

Pours a fully hazed, but just shy of milky peach flesh yellow, topped with a large finger of off-white foamy head with good retention, leaving a tall collar of lacing as it recedes. No visible effervescence through the haze.

Nose: Instantly recognisable as a Nelson single hop IPA. Green, grassy, herbal notes of cut grass, unripe horned melon rind, lime leaf, white grape, passionfruit, feijoa, lychee, leafy, vegetal wild herbs, unripe pineapple, unripe mango, orange zest, and a peppery twinge.

Palate: As expected, this greets the palate with the same Nelson intensity as on the nose. Horned melon, acidic pineapple, white grape, unripe mango, passionfruit, lychee, kumquat, and unripe melon rind, shifting into some greener notes of lime leaf, lime zest, fresh cut grass, and a vegetal, planty root note - green, and slightly earthy. This shifts into oily, resinous, leafy territory, before taking on a very distinct lime zest note. The beer finishes with this lingering lime zest, complete with a firm pithy bitterness, and showing some pale, flakey malt underneath.

Mouthfeel/Body: For the higher ABV, this drinks wonderfully. All the 8% flavor saturation, but remains crisp, fluid, and drinkable. It still has that soft, fluffy New England texture, but it's never sticky, sappy, or heavy. Effervescence is moderate, but very fine, lending a nice fuzziness. There's that signature racey Hill minerality to it, which compliments a wonderful touch of hop acidity.

Overall: A truly fantastic display of Nelson - so on-point, it almost serves as a Nelson caricature, in the best possible way. Densely saturated, green, leafy, and vegetal, with all the uniqueness inherent to Nelson. The base beer is so classically Hill Farmstead, which only serves to elevate the experience with an impressive display of quality and craftsmanship. Balanced, polished, and refined, shining everywhere you could want a Hill IPA to shine."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.39,"Liked this a bit more than the galaxy version - both pale in comparison to the DDH version, but this was really solid. A little more dank than the other two versions, but that's A-OK with me. Medium body, a little heavier than what I'd classify as an ""easy drinker,"" however these are perfect for a day at the pool, or cracking on a hot muggy day. Good to great beer - you won't be disappointed in this one."

Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,3.62,"I have to differ from the crowd on this review… I found this to have a so-so taste nondescript smell and a somewhat disagreeable pine aftertaste. Maybe it was a bad batch. Got it on April 25, 2020 from the Canton brewery."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.14,"Pours a slightly murky starburst dark orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is earthy, citrusy, tropical fruity hops with a sprig of bready and earthy malts. Together it nets out a modestly sweet aroma. Flavor profile is tropical fruits and citrus packed in front of a lightly rindy, earthy, herbal hop blend. Hops are stacked on top of bready and earthy malts. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very soft carbonated texture. Overall, fun and playful with slightly rindy earthy, citrusy hops that keep it drinking smooth and balanced. Not a typical juice bomb.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,4.21,"From a 16oz can dated 11/12/19 into a pint glass. Pours a very murky, nearly opaque brownish yellow with about a finger of white head. Not much retention or lacing to speak of. Strong smells of pineapple and grapefruit. Taste follows the nose, mostly pineapple with some hop bitterness and citrus tang. Pretty soft mouthfeel. Overall, another great brew from Trillium!"

Blessed,4.75,375ml bottle poured into a snifter. Quite decadent. Liquid frosting with plenty of floaties.
Blessed,4.98,"Yup, it’s that good. Superior flavors burst out of a jet black pour. Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, purified angel urine; it’s all there and more. Amazing."
Blessed,3.89,"Just too sweet for me. Has the look, smell, and mouthfeel of a great BA stout. I just couldn’t get past the sweetness to rate it higher"
Blessed,4.55,"Batch 2, 2022

Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open

Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting

To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple

While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing

This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!"
Blessed,4.52,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic.

The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy.

The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste.

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout."
Blessed,4.19,"Dark, inky body, opaque; carbonation burbles percolate above a flat crown with no head. Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.

This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.

Pouring temperature: 41 °F; bottling data: unknown bottling date or version; ABV listed as 15.5%"
Blessed,4.07,"Batch 1. 2020. Good not great. Sweet, but not overly. Chocolate bomb on the nose on opening. Like most Anchorage, not much barrel. Won’t seek it out again."
Blessed,4.74,"Gold label. B2. Amazing nose of coconut, bourbon and chocolate. So easy to drink. I need another one!"
Blessed,4.83,"Pitch black, smooth, and decadent. Worth the hunt for sure."
Blessed,3.21,"b2, gold label. Sweetest thing I have drank in years, straight cake icing."
Blessed,4.54,"Look - black thick syrup
Smell - coconut chocolate and barrel
Taste - really great chocolate coconut and barrel like the smell
Feel - thick and creamy
OVearll - Fantastic Fudge, need to try again and not at the end of the night when I'm leaving a beer share"
Blessed,4.79,"2021 Release.

First time trying Blessed, and not disappointed. Tastes like booze-soaked Samoa Cookies; huge notes of chocolate, vanilla, & toasted coconut. Finishes warm and boozy, with very little residual bitterness."
Blessed,4.73,"Blood of the Old Gods. Pours ichor black out of the bottle with a whisper of head. Clings to the glass as vapors of bourbon and vanilla soaked coconut creep into your nostrils. Body is velvety and thick. Adjuncts are barely restrained by the barrel backbone they cling to. Excess and intemperance croon as they weave themselves into your (soul? mind?) mouth. Let it warm up, and you will be truly..."
Blessed,4.63,"Released December 2021; drank 1/25/22 @ Roadrunner Lodge.

Black brown appearance.

An even pour yielded no head; no lace.

Rich vanilla, smooth bourbon, milk chocolate & mild coconut notes in the nose.

Creamy, thick mouthfeel.

Rich vanilla, cabernet sauvignon & rich milk chocolate flavors up front; smooth, mild bourbon heat on the finish.

Decadent; phenomenal. You don't have to like ""pastry stouts"" to enjoy this masterpiece."
Xocoveza,4.37,"Have had before (and certainly had fresher, as this bottle had a best before date of July 17 - 2018 - this is on me - in my cellar at 60 degrees F).
It pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head - again 5 years old...so my fault on the head.
Amazing nose with chocolate, cinnamon spice and vanilla - perhaps a hint of roasty coffee - but the spice notes are just right.
Taste is smooth with chocolate note, vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice, yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness.
Despite the limited head, this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel. Hopefully Stone (Sapporo) sends some fresh stuff north to Canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here...."
Xocoveza,5,"This is my first sample. I'm wary of stouts made with lactose, because while I have had a couple of good ones -- Espressway and Two Die 4 by Two Roads -- I've had sickeningly sweet examples such as Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing and Brig from Springdale.

In any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice.

It is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.

The palate stuns me. Beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. The spice component is perfect; it is not overdone.

The beer's high ABV is utterly hidden.

I have nothing but praise for this stout. It is the best beer from Stone I've ever had. It is perfect."
Xocoveza,4.25,12/25/21 Shared bottle @ Brian’s.
Xocoveza,4.23,"I've had this fresh and cellared.

Jet black body with a dark khaki head.
Picking up cinnamon, coffee and dark chocolate.
Taste fresh has chocolate, cinnamon, slight chili pepper and warm spices.
Taste with a couple of years changed a little, more of a roasted coffee and chocolate and little to no chili peppers, but the cinnamon and cardamom spices are a little more prevalent.
Mouthfeel fresh and aged is full and satisfying. A decent lingering chocolate spice cake on the tongue.
A really tasty beer fresh or with a little age on it. Actually I prefer it with a couple of years."
Xocoveza,4.25,"On tap at Cardinal Pub Bar, Stavanger: black colour, tan head. Aroma and flavour of roast malts, coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, lactose, chili peppers. Very good and unusual beer."
Xocoveza,4.33,"look: 95% black

smell: light chocolate coffee

taste: roasted malt, the chocolate flavor is actually not that strong, and I can barely taste the pepper or cinnamon

feel: creamy and smooth, maybe a little too bitter tho

overall: this is far away from treehouse milk stouts, it's overrated in my opinion"
Xocoveza,4.25,"Robust, Dark, and Bold with fine lacing. Distinct hints of cinnamon, peppers, spices, and chocolate, in both the nose and palate. It all finishes strongly and slowly."
Xocoveza,3.75,Cinnamon upfront followed by some spice from the peppers with a coffee finish. The more you drink the better it gets.
Xocoveza,4.15,"Wait for this beer to come out every year. I liked the green package beer, better than the red packaging."
Xocoveza,4.27,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Black, huge head.

Smell: Gingerbread/cinnamon, sweetness.

Taste: Mild sweetness, cinnamon, slight hot pepper hit, reminds me of a gingerbread cookie with a spicy chaser.

Overall: Nice holiday beer, ginger cookie flavor with some warming alcohol. I'll have to pick up some more for the coming cold months."
Xocoveza,4.05,"I’m a big fan of winter stouts. Picked up a six pack at the local beer distributor. Pour very dark, nice aroma. Taste was different from other stouts I have had. Was skeptical at first. By the end of the six pack, I was a believer. Went back to pick up another six pack a week and a half later, gone."
Xocoveza,4.77,"Pouring this nearly black can of awesomeness into a pint glass produced a 1"" tan head that had excellent retention and lacing. This beer looks just wonderful.

Aroma was complex. At cellar temperature: Mexican chocolate, peppers, vanilla, faint cinnamon. It was like smelling an aromatic puzzle where all the pieces fit together perfectly.

Taste: Just wow. Taste follows the nose. This is just the right level of sweetness for a holiday stout. The peppers and cinnamon provide just a touch of lingering heat, and the chocolate gives you a bit of unsweetened bitterness. This is really a wonderful beer - strong competition for Prairie's Christmas Bomb.

Mouthfeel toes the line between medium and full bodied, which is a perfect compliment to the flavor profile. This is just thick enough for the big, bold flavors, but also incredibly smooth.

Overall: I am filled with regret that I only bought a single. This will be a six pack next year. Just....wow."
Xocoveza,4.49,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. Canned on 9/16/20, so this exactly 3 months old. I only cooled this in the fridge for a short time, and I gave it some time to come closer to room temperature for a while before opening. Seems to be the right temperature - just cool but not cold. Could even probably drink this at cellar temperature and it would be good.

Look: Pours almost pitch black with light brown highlights. Has a very nice looking fluffy brown head. The head dissipated slowly; a very thin head is lingering. Tiny bubbles are slowly rising to the surface.

Smell: This has a very nice, complex aroma. The first things that I get are coffee, cocoa powder, fruity chili pepper, and roasty toasty malts. The back end has cinnamon and nutmeg. Hard to pick up the vanilla on the nose, but it could easily be blending in with the chocolate and other aromas. After drinking, I can pick up on a vanilla cream note in the nose on the front end that is reminiscent of cream soda, very nice. Gives some nutty roasted almond notes too that are quite nice. A mild earthy hop aroma and acidity on the finish as well. This smells like Mexican hot chocolate and it smells delicious!

Taste: Wow, this is a lot sweeter than I expected. It at least has a perceived sweetness initially. It's very smooth and drinkable. This is a dangerous beer at 8.1% ABV. The flavors in this beer meld together very nicely; to me they are more discernible on the nose than in the mouth. Up front, you get spiced coffee/hot chocolate notes and sweetness that quickly transition to a roasty, slightly bitter finish with a lingering spicy chili pepper. The finish has really nice unsweetened chocolate notes, along with some fruitiness from the chocolate and pasilla pepper. The finish has a lot of sweetness also; you can tell your brain what you want to focus on - bitter or sweet. I get a lot of spiced nut notes on the finish as well.

Feel: Mouthfeel is really nice - on the thicker side of medium body. Slightly chewy and pefectly carbonated for this type of beer.

Overall: A really delicious adjunct stout. Is this a pastry stout? I have heard so much about pastry stouts, but I don't actually know how to characterize one and whether this is in or out. Regardless, it's a very delicious beer. With all the specialty ingredients that they put in, you sure hope that it would come out delicious but they could have easily messed up such a complicated recipe. Kudos to Stone for finding the right balance to express all of these flavors without overpowering the beer.

Note: Lactose added."
Xocoveza,4.22,"From a can. This pours a dark coffee cola color with heaping layers of creamy foam. Nice dusting of cinnamon on the nose, and what I think of an ancho chile note. Dry finish, with some cacao in the back, and more cinnamon."
Xocoveza,4.68,"Not a whole lot to say that hasn't been said already. This beer looks, smells, and tastes fantastic. Make sure you let it warm up a bit so you can fully appreciate everything it brings to the table."
Xocoveza,4.08,"Pours very dark with a big foamy head that slowly fades. Big chocolate aroma mixes with pepper, smokey. Flavor is chocolate, coffee, some smoky pepper, vanilla, faint cinnamon. Light to medium bodied, has a bitter espresso finish. Overall a good stout, I would expect it to be thicker, richer, and creamier.

12 oz can dated 9/9/20
4 rating"
Xocoveza,4.21,"I purchased a March 2018 bottle and consumed it 8 months past the best by date. Despite being supposedly old it was creamy, mellow and smooth. Not much pepper or heat.

Fast forward to 2020: I finally found this fresh, canned 5 weeks ago. Red chile pepper meets nutmeg, tobacco, dark chocolate, cinnamon, lactose, cocoa and char. It's not especially thick but there's enough creaminess to cut the heat and it never gets too sweet.

This is a really nice stout."
Xocoveza,4.37,"Delicious, I just wish the cinnamon would be toned down a little."
Duet,4.03,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?"
Duet,4.59,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA."
Duet,4.14,"Really solid beer. I had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what I remember or just what I expected in a West Coast IPA, but really a great beer. I have rounded my 'overall' up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. I downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking ('hazy') and feeling ('juicy') like a NEIPA is not a positive for me. I was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. Nonetheless, I loved the foamy pour, the piney smell, and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. There's no doubt I would have this again."
Duet,4.38,"Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).

Cheers"
Duet,3.7,Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.
Duet,4.56,Wonderful beer. Piney aroma along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Earthy pine dominates. Medium body and carbonation on the feel. This is an outstanding representation of what I would classify as a West Coast IPA. I use to be able to get this beer at Total Wine in Virginia in bottles. Then it disappeared. Now I can get it only in cans which is better than not at all. It has become my everyday go to session IPA although the cost continues to go up. Still well worth a try.
Duet,4.37,Very piney and floral hops with a moderate bitterness. Some tropical fruit and citrus too. Lots of hop character. Finishes clean and with a malty sweetness.
Duet,4.21,Looks beautiful. Golden orange with about one finger of head and solid lacing as it goes down. Smell is pine along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Earthy pine dominates. Medium body and carbonation on the feel. This is an outstanding representation of what I would classify as a West Coast IPA
Duet,4.25,"From a 12oz can dated 3/5/21 into a weizen glass.

Pours a translucent light amber color with about a finger and a half of white head. Average retention, decent lacing.

Smell isn't overpowering but definitely picking up nice tones of grape, berry, apple and light citrus. Pine and earth linger in the background.

Picking up some grape in the taste but also a decent amount of pine and resiny bitterness.

Slightly thin mouthfeel but sticky. Medium carbonation. Bitter resiny aftertaste.

Overall a really nice WCIPA. Excited to find this freshish (~1 mo) in these parts."
Duet,4.1,"12 oz. can (01/06.21) poured into a pint glass with a slightly hazy golden color, quickly receding off white head and minimal lacing. Smells of pine, citrus, grass and some malt. Taste is similar to aroma with grapefruit, pine, earthy hops and malt to balance the bitterness. Medium body with good carbonation and a touch of alcohol. Overall, a good balanced citrus/piney IPA."
Duet,4.13,"10/31/15:
Beautiful. Gorgeous. Clear, bright golden, lovely chalk white head.

Perfect. Lemon, lime, grapefruit, ...pine and citrus aplenty. Yeah, man.

Taste: yum. All kinds of hop delights. All the best. Mmmm. Lush, luscious, full-on fruity and fantastic. Loads of citrus and touches of tropical. It's so good. It's ....it's wonderful. It's exactly right. Everything is right right now. It's all good.

They know what they're doing out in Alpine, California.

Damn it, this is a good beer and I can drink it. You should, too.

Hey, there's some stuff on the label. Let's read it: ""A West Coast IPA that features Amarillo and Simcoe hops ""in harmony,"" giving a bright, floral aroma. Duet is nicely bitter with the perfect amount of malt concealed behind the hoppy goodness. Immensely drinkable, amazingly nimble on it's feet."""
Duet,4.15,"13oz pour at Roma’s.

Nice middle yellow with a small white head and generous lacing.

Melon, general citrus, pineapple, and yes I do get the cedar.

Juicy, full of flavor. Citrus and fruit up front with piney bitterness.

Full, slick body with moderate carbonation.

Lives up to Alpine’s reputation."
Saison Dupont,4,"Good carbonation that created a nice fluffy head, didn't stay very long but didn't dissipated instantly either. Bright golden color. Can taste the yeast. Feels similar to a Belgian but lighter and more bitter. There is a hint of fruit but I can't say what, others said banana, very possible. Easy to drink, cheers!"
Saison Dupont,4.16,"Look: It pours golden with a white head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: It has strong yeasty aromas with grainy malt spices and lemon.

Taste: It has yeast and earthly flavors with some lemon and spice. There are hints of banana in the background. Coriander is the most distinguishable spice.

Feel: It has a medium body with a dry aftertaste.

Overall, a great combination of flavors."
Saison Dupont,3.84,"Look: Slightly hazy light orange. A massive 4 fingers of thick white head even on a careful pour, forming a stiff mushroom cap over the top that takes several minutes to even start dying down.

Smell: Very floral, with spices, banana, and orange peel.

Taste: Light malt, strong floral hop bitterness, mild sweetness. Lingering bitterness on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, with high carbonation.

Overall: A definite part of history, but the soapy bitterness is a bit high."
Saison Dupont,4.24,"Pours a hazy copper color with a small head and light lacing.

Smells of bread and yeast.

Tastes of bready sweet malt, yeast, banana, cloves and pepper with a slightly bitter finish.

Medium light body and carbonation. Light dry mouthfeel.

This is a very tasty, complex and well balanced brew!"
Saison Dupont,4.77,"11.2oz - found overpriced singles at Total Wine after the nice gal at the local death merchant ordered me some 4-packs

Looks amazing, chunky and looking like DUFF otherwise. Smells like funk and sweet barley. Taste has subtle banana sweetness, grassy hops that are medicinally bitter, hints of pepper and clove. Complex. Dry and well carbonated, the 6.5% is just perfect, and this drinks way too easy sitting there

The perfect summer beer: good for pool time, grilling, brown bagging it in the park, whatever"
Saison Dupont,4.57,The complex banana-forward taste and the beautiful medium-bodied mouth feel work together to make this beer an immediate favorite.
Saison Dupont,4.33,"This beer is exactly what I thought, years and years and years ago when I first heard of real craft beer, that it would look and taste like.

Pours a beautiful light orangey straw like colour, moderately cloudy in the glass. Four inches of rocky creamy head, like a little mountain, abide in the glass for a long time, even when it collapses 15 minutes later there is a layer of 1 inch thick head remaining. Simply put, it’s absolutely gorgeous.

This has a genuine barnyard smell on the nose. This is a generic phrase you hear a lot for saison and some other Belgian ales, but it is absolutely true here. Maybe because this is brewed at an actual farmhouse (they also produce bread locally and cheese you can buy) Leather and straw smells are strong, with some mild yeasty notes. Earthy, dirt like mist hits with the yeasty smells, like opening a wooden door on a dew-y, mildly humid summer morning. I’m not kidding, that’s not just flavour description, it really smells like that.

Taste is wonderfully complex. You might get hit with lemon upfront on some sips, or grassy hop bitterness on others, I think it depends how much you sip with how much air. Evolves to a mouthful of sourdough bread and yeast after a few seconds. Barnyard funkiness is all over, waning in and out of the other tastes. Yeast, citrus, fresh straw can also be noted throughout the tasting.

Medium body that ends with a sharp crispiness and dryly. Goes down smooth and easy, with the absolute perfect amount of carbonation. With my reviews I’ve always tried to do short, 3 paragraphs with straightforward descriptions, and I tried to keep it here too. Everything I wrote you absolutely will smell and taste, it sounds like a flowery review but that’s just because this beer is just that good. I’m looking forward to getting a bunch more as soon as possible and cellaring a couple bottles for the future. An absolute benchmark of the saison style and a recommendation to absolutely anyone who loves beer. Saison Dupont is remarkably complex and maybe most importantly, unbelievably delicious."
Saison Dupont,4.27,"Golden yellow with a 1"" thick, foamy white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing. Slight haze.

Aroma is dank & funky, barnyard.

Taste is tart, horse blanket, acidic.

Light body, lively carbonation. Tart, acidic finish.

Now, this is a great Farmhouse Ale. Good across the board."
Saison Dupont,4.26,"Bottled, is it bottle conditioned and purchased from Timperley Village Bargain Booze
Pours a fairly hazy golden body with thick white head
Aroma is grainy barley & pearly dee drop drops
Flavour is spritely slightly sour clean drinking"
Saison Dupont,4.12,"On draft at Babygold Barbeque [Berwyn,IL]

Pours a cloudy golden yellow, with a lingering tight, frothy head. Yeasty, banana, grassy, lemon nose. Most of the nose can be tasted, and the mouthfeel on draft is a little more effervescent than from the bottle. Overall, this a benchmark and standard that anyone looking for a French Saison should use."
Saison Dupont,4.35,"Had on tap at Zeno's Pub, State College, Penna.

L: Golden and a little hazy, with a moderate head that hangs around and good lacing. Not as much sediment as would be present if it was bottled, probably.
S: Funky, earthy, different notes as it warms
T: Same as the smell, but with a little more hop bitterness
F: Mellow, a little carbonation sting. Funk hangs around for a while.
O: Absolute classic, love to see it on tap at the local"
Saison Dupont,4.03,"Pours a clear, golden color with loads of robust, long lasting foam leaving behind plenty of lacing. Aroma has plenty of funk, with floral / herbal notes, as well as some banana, Took me several deep whiffs to appreciate the relative complexity of the aroma. Taste is heavy on the yeast and cloves, with a funky / earthy quality to it. Mostly dry, well carbonated and fairly crisp. Glad I finally got a chance to try this classic beer."
Peche Du Fermier,4.55,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Blend #2. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle."
Peche Du Fermier,4.6,Bottle shared by Hopelessly0.
Peche Du Fermier,4.59,"Pours orange gold with a slight head that dissipates immediately. On the nose, faint peach, earthy funk, white pepper, and slight oakiness. On the palate, a little peach, white wine, pepper with a puckering sour finish. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Very refreshing! Overall, even though I expected a little more peach flavor, this is a very nice variant on a classic saison!"
Peche Du Fermier,3.43,"750 mL bottle. Clear golden. Smells of peach and strong stone fruit acidity. Tastes of just about all stone fruit sourness. Sour peach. Oak. A little earthy and fruity yeast in the finish. Just about as sour as I can handle. Good peach flavor, but not much else to it."
Peche Du Fermier,4.18,"Blend 3, from bottle.

Deep yellow-orange (like a peach) color appearance with foam which quickly dissipates. This smells like peach already, but a lot of barnyard funk too in the aroma. Flavor is plenty fruity, with overripe peaches throughout. Tart and acidic (not as acidic as some of the other Side Project beers but more than most would expect). Tart and dry finish."
Peche Du Fermier,4.3,"Foggy dull burnt orange with a short but persistent white blanket leaving some solid sheeting with a tilt.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.

This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger."
Peche Du Fermier,4.49,Blend #2
Peche Du Fermier,3.92,"Pours a clouded orange color with a medium, froth head.

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.

Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.

Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.

Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs."
Summer Shandy,3.77,Super good classic beer. There isn’t much of a strong flavor but what it gives is great.
Summer Shandy,3.09,"Hazy golden creamy with off white head. Lacing was modest. This the ""Arnold Palmer"" of beers. Taste follows aroma, beer with some lemon flavoring. Taste ady dtinking, but wouldn't want to drink more than one per session."
Summer Shandy,3.73,"Looks cloudy yellow. Nice lemon fragrance. Tasted like it’s created to be; beer infused with lemon. This combination works very well. Like many others have stated, this is great on a hot summer day."
Summer Shandy,3.3,"They have an origin story about a guy mixing beer with lemonade on the side of this can. That pretty accurately describes what this beer tastes like, but neither is bringing its 'A' game. On the beer end, there is light malt and an underlying steely industrial quality. On the lemonade end, it's a bit watered down. Still, it balances sweetness and tartness to an appropriate degree. It has your standard light beer feel, with a light mouthfeel and sharp carbonation. I enjoyed it for its freshness and it is better than most macros you can buy if only for its lemon flavor."
Summer Shandy,4.05,Light and refreshing. Great beer for a hot summer day.
Summer Shandy,3.44,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy light color with a one finger head that dissipates down to a film and then a ring. Agitation brings back a half finger head.

S - Some light malt scents but lots of lemon and citrus scents.

T - Taste follows scent as a lemonade flavored beer. There is some mild flavorful grapefruit bitterness in there as well.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some zesty carbonation.

O - Overall this is a solid summer option. Very good in 95+ degree weather. I like that this gives me the flavor like a hard lemonade, but doesn’t come in overly sweet or sugary. I’d recommend this as a solid summer, outdoor, and camping option"
Summer Shandy,3.31,"It's a hot day. You're thirsty and don't want water. You're out of your daily drinker and there is no lemonade either in the fridge. Well. Leinenkugel has you covered ; a lemonade flavored beer. The review is easy here. Lots of lemon in the nose, bright yellowish soda color, above average carbonation. Taste follows nose. A decent thirst quencher that deserves a small spot in your fridge during a heat wave"
Summer Shandy,3.26,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by 7/18/22. Plenty fresh.

Looks decent enough in the glass. Cloudy yellow with orange hints body. Small white head shrinks to a ring and covering, spotted lacing.

Smells like lemonade.

Tastes like lemonade too.

Mouth just about reaches medium, finish a musty lemon.

Overall, had this today in defiance of snow showers falling in NE PA. I get this would be great in the dog days of summer, but there are far better options for that."
Summer Shandy,3.18,"This beer besides smelling great, really sucks. They were BOGO at a supermarket near me so I have about 8 bottles left. I wonder if this beer is good with a lime or lemon in it?"
Summer Shandy,4.68,"This beer has a cloudy appearance, but everything else about it is pure sunshine. The citrusy taste isn’t overpowering, just enough for the drink to be refreshing. Perfect for a sunny day."
Summer Shandy,3.09,"If you love lemonade and light beer, Summer Shandy will send you to heaven. I don't fit that demographic, but it's still a refreshing sip on a hot summer day."
Summer Shandy,3.61,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
Looks golden yellow with a nice white foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin ring.
Smells lightly bready, lemony, sweet.
Taste follows the nose nicely with a prominent lemon flavor.
Mouth feel is medium light for the style.
Overall a very refreshing Shandy that I might order again.
Cheers!"
Summer Shandy,4.77,"This is tied for my all time favorite beer along with Wittenkerke's white ale.

Very crisp, and light. One of those shandy/fruity beers that still tastes like beer. Taste is great, just a little bit tart and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp at times, but man is this a delicious beer if you like light, crisp and tart."
Summer Shandy,1,Too much lemon
Summer Shandy,3.1,This is just a really refreshing beer for the summertime that packs some great citrus flavor.
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.25,"2020 bottle poured slightly warmer than fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous dark brown with a solid amount of slightly off-white head. Lots of lacing as the head recedes.

Nose is dominated by toffee and freshly baked bread. Malty, with really nice notes of raisin, plums, and port. A little bit of apple and a hint of brown sugar. Rich and wonderful.

The taste is excellent. Rich and very flavorful. Again, hit with a nice amount of toffee upfront. A Christmas cake flavor follows. Sultanas, maraschino cherries, banana bread, and a little bit of chocolate. Quite sweet and fruity. Tastes fresh! Absolutely love it.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied. The aftertaste is also fairly sweet and malty. Overall, a lovely beer that I will definitely buy again."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.06,"Review 1540
Transitioning to Beligum Dubbel for my next beer. First beer from this brewery. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a goblet. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered creamy tan head with fair retention. The head dissipated slowly leaving some lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 24, a dark brown with some ruby hues. The beer is not clear and more cloudy. The appearance of the beer is average, wanted a longer-lasting head.

The initial aromas in the beer are raisins, plum, cherries, and toffee. Nosing further, I detect roasted malts, bananas, caramel, fruity esters, biscuit, and malty sweetness.

The flavors in the beer are peppery, spicy phenols, bananas, malty sweetness, plums, raisins, cherry, fruity esters, toffee, caramel, cloves, and leather.

The mouthfeel of the beer is warming and coating.

The body of the beer is medium, low carbonation, and a medium finish.

The beer is good, but I wanted more depth in the flavor profile. I thought the beer was a touch light in the body for me. Well balanced and not overly acidic. It was okay to me, I wanted more from the beer than what I got."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,3.91,"L: Ruby-red/brown in colour. Looks appetising. 1 finger head at pour which later dissipats to 0.5 one. Decvent lacing.
S: Caramel banana, candy, plums, black currant, black bread, apricots, pears.
T: Smelled more complex, but getting notes of bread, biscuits, honey, candy, sugar, plum.
F: Med/high carb, good balance of sweet and bitter, low/mid mouthfeel, abv is hidden.
O: Good belgian brown, an easy drinking companion."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,3.84,"Unusual color for the style, looks more like a tripel. It is a nice copper color with a full white head that stays around for a bit.

Smells strongly of yeast and malt, very fresh baked bread like.

Bit bready with a lot of fruit, mainly raisin and apple and pear. There is a touch of bitterness at the finish with some lingering sweetness.

Feel is smooth and fairly full, but not feeling much carbonation.

Overall a pretty good beer, but not quite world class. While I have yet to find a bad Trappist beer, this one is at the lower end of my favorites. Still, being a low end Trappist beer puts it ahead of many others."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.21,"Poured into my Westvleteten glass that I “borrowed” from the tasting garden in Belgium. Pours into glass with very little head that dissipated quickly. Not as much initial bite from the esters as say an ABT. Tastes like a true Trappist Dubel like it is with strong raisin and dark dark fruits. Definitely not my favorite Belgian Dubel, but better than most attempts not made by a monk."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.16,"L: Clear, dark Ruby with a big light tan head and modest lacing.

S: Spicy phenolics, light fleshed fruits, raisin, and bready yeast.

T: Big bready base supports flavors of raisin, leather, apple, pear, and spice.

F: Medium bodied but very crisp and dry.

Overall: A really fantastic dubbel, every bit as good as the other Trappist dubbels. Will definitely be getting this one again."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.38,"Trappist Achel Bruin
Bottle. Gold cap no year. Caramel brown color. White head with some lace.

Raisins, figs, molasses, plums, caramel, toffee, and bready malts. Some citrus. Very malty. True to the quad style but only 8%? Very flavorful and very drinkable."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,3.39,"I'm having a hard time getting to truly enjoy this because the flavors tend to be too bready, toffee, caramelly for my taste. That tends to make the brew seem not at all bright and refreshing."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.27,"Appearance is a rich reddy brown with a generous amber head which becomes lumpy and little lacing. Lively but not overpowering carbonation.

Aroma doesn’t give much away, quite faint hints of yeast and malt. Taste is everything with this brew, rich yet weirdly light, getting raisins, figs, dandelion and burdock. Heavy yet strangely easy drinking. Mouthfeel is soft and dry. Would recommend it."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,3.88,"11.2oz bottle marked 07/08/17 (assuming & hoping that's a package date) poured into a Westmalle goblet at just above fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown in color with mahogany highlights and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and puffy island. The aroma is faint with brown sugar and dark fruits. The taste is semisweet burnt sugar caramel, a hint of dark fruit, finished with some minimal tart and oxidized flavor. Mild to moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just above average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, good. I'm afraid this one is many years old. Solid except for the smell and taste, which aren't bad, just muted. Would love to try it fresh. Purchased at a local shop at room temperature."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,3.97,"Pours a dark reddish brown with soft, soapy head.

Smell is malty and a bit sweet with fruity notes of raisins, dried fruit and a bit of paint.

Taste is fruity, spicy and yeasty with notes of dried fruit, raisins, brown sugar and banana, with a soft bitterness on the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium, frothy and well carbonated.

Overall, a well-made classic."
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.11,"Lable in Dutch and French, but I see it says it's refermented in the bottle. After resting well and pouring carefully I pour no sediment and there is a minor amount left in the bottle.
L- Clear, deep chestnut brown, pours with 1Cm off-white head that's holding well. [15mins later, Head holding really well, and lacing forming down the sides of glass].
S- Quite mild, I might be congested. Just a touch of 'the deep Tripel style roasted fruit' smell and a hint of alcohol.
T- Woah, starts gently and builds on the palate. Deep dark roasty flavours balanced well by quite bright hopping. Hints of spice, and I think I'm getting hints of orange, or perhaps raisons + orange. I'd started on this straight from the fridge, but it's flavour is notably opening up as it warms just a touch in the glass. I'd suggest not over-chilling it.
F- It's definitely a meaty beer, I'd put it squarely in the Winter-warmer category. Made for slow-sipping, meaty enough to be enjoyed in place of wine.
O- It's lovely, very satisfying on a harsh winter's day. There's zero here wrong/out of balance/etc in my view. Would happily buy it again.
330ml bottle. Bought from Beerhawk/UK. BB: 22/02/2021"
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.1,Decent beer with complex nose. Solid double taste and good mouthfeel. Some bread taste in this as well as dried fruit. Goes down smooth and very solid.
Trappist Achel 8° Bruin,4.2,"Complex nose with plenty of malt and yeast as is to be expected with the style. The flavor is, up front, comfortingly spiced and rounded with banana, bread, and dried fruit notes. The finish is what makes this beer for me: the earthy, fruity, leathery nature of its aftertaste leaves with me the impression of an earthy, well aged tempranillo. Wine-like likely because of the high alcohol content. Good beer!"
Newcastle Brown Ale,2.68,"Ok. Ordered it thinking it was an English Brown Ale, but it was nothing special. I understand why now that I’ve read some recent reviews about it being sold to Lagunitas and not what it once was. I would agree it was somewhat syrupy. Ok to drink if nothing else malt forward available."
Newcastle Brown Ale,1.22,"This is an incredibly disappointing beer. I could end there but will keep going...

Purchased at Purvis Beer in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne, in Australia in November 2021.

The beer looks more like a soft drink in the glass than a beer. Its clarity is astounding for a brown beer; it's a burnished copper with light brown highlights where the light reflects from the glass. But that is as good as this beer gets.

Aroma-wise, there's a sweet, syrupy cola/Dr.Pepper mix that brought to the fore thoughts of fly spray and even citronella. There was nothing appealing at all about the smell, in fact quite the opposite.

Taste is no improvement on the smell. It's as sweet as the aroma hints, and there's that cola/Dr.Pepper thing going on. It's clearly a light struck beer as evidenced by the skunky, metallic taste that overrides everything else.

In the mouth it's thin and light, just like a soft drink.

Overall this is a disappointing shell of a beer. I understand it's now brewed under licence, and can only presume it's been bastardised in the name of fiscal efficiency. Well, I can't imagine ever paying to drink this beer again, so I suppose it will help with my fiscal efficiency, so mission accomplished?

Cheers!"
Newcastle Brown Ale,1.63,"Gave the look a four because it looks like a Newcastle Brown Ale. However, my understanding is that this is now a Lagunitas product. Combined with the recipe change five or six years ago, the firm’s obstinate refusal to do away with the clear glass that ruins the beer and selling out to macro garbage like Lagunitas, this is undrinkable swill. One of the admonishments from BA is that we’re supposed to be respectful of the brewer. That statement is obviously ridiculous, taken out of context. I understand the idea behind it though. As such, I didn’t give it straight ones.
I have had Newcastle Brown Ale in not a few pubs across the pond, as far back as 1997. Reviewing that beer would be a wonderful time. Drinking this (er, taking two swallows and pouring out the rest) was such a departure from those halcyon days, I may have unconsciously used this beer as a stand in for my deep regret of having returned to the Disneyland Freakshow States of Oligopoly.
Whatever the case, this is tragic. No, this was never the finest beer. But it was relatively inexpensive and decent (out of a keg) - pretty much the opposite of whatever this is."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.91,"Drank this so much and so often in the 90s I certainly tried, and failed, to replicate it when I took up brewing. Wasn't even close, enjoy one very now and again, but of course there's better browns about these days."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.31,"Dark brown look with a nice foamy beige head that recedes to a ring. Ruby look in light. Malty smell, rye bread smell, New York bagel hints. Low bitterness taste with a bready, malty, low low hip taste. Pretty bland. Watery but still vicious feel in your mouth. No super creamy, but not super citrusy. Middle of the road beer."
Newcastle Brown Ale,2.35,"I still remmeber stealing a few of these out of my dad's minifridge to bring to a neighbor girl's house, swigging it while grimacing, pretending to like it...

It's a supremely bland take on the brown ale, with tons of budweiser flavor and none of the savory goodness a true brown ale should have. Gutter tripe"
Newcastle Brown Ale,5,My Favorite Brown.
Newcastle Brown Ale,2.83,"They can do better. The first time I made my own beer for a youtube video, I made a kit called ""back to basics beer"" It was nothing fancy, 6.6 pounds of DME, some copper colored grain in a bag some hops and Nottingham yeast packet. My beer, with mistakes I made like squeezing the bag, stirring the wort, not mixing the priming sugar with hot water and some other rookie mistakes, my beer came out tasting better than a New Castle Brown Ale. NCBA is good with making beer bread with it, but not drinking it. This is just okay I prefer Bass Ale over NCBA."
Newcastle Brown Ale,1.35,"What could they possibly have been thinking when Lagunitas turned Newcastle into this syrupy brown pablum of an excuse for a beer? This was a unique ale in almost every way, but foremost in flavor and texture. Now it is entirely unremarkable. Avoid this like the plague if you are expecting anything like what this justly famous ale was known for."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.45,"Purchased as a six-pack from Wal-Mart for $9.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear brown, with a red tinge. Two-finger quick-to-dissipate tan head.
S - Bready, nutty. Some biscuit and toast notes. Slight pepper on the back.
T - Caramel. Toast. Pumpernickel bread. A slight sweetness, but not sweet overall.
F - Extremely carbonated. Refreshing. Despite the color, it's light in body.
O - I would say this beer sets a certain bar for a certain type of beer that's cheap, satisfying to drink, and goes well with every meal. Not a bad beer in the slightest, but I wish it had more of a bitterness to it. On the pricier end of the spectrum for a macrobrew, but I wouldn't mind getting this every so often. Would recommend trying at least once."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.25,"(Bottle). A good but somewhat overrated beer. Aggressively carbonated. Better in the Good Old Days when it was stronger.

Rerate, draught in Newcastle: I found the colour to be darker brown than the bottled version (can that be?), and the flavour was fuller and richer - even though the pub tried to ruin it by serving it ice cold."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.47,"Newcastle, 12oz. bottle poured into my weizen glass(20oz.) starts with a nice three finger head of a light tan foam. After several minutes it did settle back to a thin cap with a bit of lacing left behind. This ale is a dark brown that is somewhat orange when held up to the light. This beer is clear, so I can observe the moderate carbonation cascade up.
The aroma is light bready malts.
The flavor starts with a crispness up front, the light hops, giving way to sweet caramel malt flavor.
The feel is light, a bit thin.
This is an easy one to drink, the flavor is ok, the feel is light. I wish I would have one of the originals to see what all the fuss is about! !"
Newcastle Brown Ale,2.54,"This is not Newcastle brown! Please alter the name as you have completely altered and ruined my favorite brown ale! Because you have done this I will not be drinking Brown Sugga,Pilsner, lil Sumpthin, or any beer offered as a Lagunitas product. Thanks for somewhat destroying a part of my beer experience!"
Newcastle Brown Ale,2,"This is not Newcastle Brown. Have some respect for a brand that has been around since 1927. Awesome, you own it now, Langunitas. Free enterprise at it's finest but if you're going to completely change the recipe at least have the decency to change or at least alter the name to 2.0 or remix or something. To all of the basically kids that are giving the lol to people like me, you just don't get it. I've been drinking Newcastle since the early 90's. You may as well hand me a bud light and say ""here's your newkey"". NO IT'S NOT. This is not about whether or not this beer is any good. If you like it then fantastic. The point is you can't just fancy up the label and call it the same thing. Have some respect for the brand. I personally will not buy another Langunitas product again and that's my choice. Rant complete."
Newcastle Brown Ale,3.74,Another beer thrown to the wolves.
Newcastle Brown Ale,1.71,"Really gone downhill since John Smith's started breing it.
I used to love a pint of ""dog"" but won't touch it now."
Midas Touch,3.9,"It doesn't smell ancient.  It smells fruity and hoppy with malts in the background. Like a sweet smelling IPA.

It's bitter up front and a little spicy somehow.  Then the bready malts are really strong.  It is also fruity the entire time.

It's a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation.  The finish tastes like a pastry, both like bread and honey.

It's pretty damn good, not as exotic as the description promises (not a hint of saffron).  It's an interesting beer. I give it a 4.7 out of 6."
Midas Touch,3.71,"Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Smells of honey, white grape juice & grains; subtle boozy aroma. Taste follows the nose, this really reminds me of white grape juice that is carbonated, it is good though. Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth finish. Very interesting brew, I was happy to try it, but I don't think I would purchase again."
Midas Touch,3.64,"Opaque, deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing. Sweet, honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness. Flavor reintroduces the sweetness, as well as soft fruit (grapes, kiwi) and spice (particularly in the aftertaste). Vinous, medium-to-full bodied mouthfeel; long lasting finish."
Midas Touch,2.61,"All I taste is saffron.
Who drinks this stuff on a regular basis?"
Midas Touch,3.99,"12 oz bottle from a mix-6, split with my wife and poured into a snifter. Aroma and flavor are white grape, dry honey, and surprisingly little alcohol for the 9% abv. An interesting beer and much more drinkable than I expected. Fun to try but not something I'm likely to buy again."
Midas Touch,3.98,"Figured it was time to give this beer a whirl.
This bottle is ancient indeed...6/28/19, so a little over a year old at this point. Poured into an Ommegang snifter.

Pours a surprisingly gold color (I expected burnt orange like a barleywine) with a fluffy creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a mossy ring with lace built up on the sides.

Aroma is pleasantly fruity and bright with elements of grape and citrus, slight pineapple, slight melon. Everything is brighter than expected. I guess I should shift my focus.

Flavor is a bit wasted at this point with some oxidized hops in tow somewhere; trying to re-align, I spot some more vinous but still white grape-ish notes, some oak barrel, a little bit of muscat, some melon rind, white grapefruit, honey, chive, and a bit of cilantro or other fresh herb.

Feel is crisp and starchy, but has a nice sticky yet oaky barrel barrel presence. Alcohol presence is rather high but to be expected, though feels more along the lines of a 12%'er. Drying finish with that microfiber sponge feel.

Overall this beer isn't bad, and I should try to find it fresher to get a better picture of it. Dogfish Head continues to be the curator of off-centered shit and this is definitely one of those examples. I like it though, it's twisted and won't fit into any of your neat little polite food tray-sized niches.

Price paid : $3.69 / bottle
Would buy again : Probably, to try it fresher."
Midas Touch,3.81,"Bottled 1/22/20

Ancient ales, huh? My first one of the series, I didn't even realize they were doing a batch this year

Pours a lightly cloudy orange/gold with just a white cap that fizzles away to a ring of bubbles very fast and leaves no lacing

Quite the odd aroma here, I'm picking up a lot of different notes. There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent

Oh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well

Pretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry

A perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations. Others however, might say that this is hardly beer and is not good. Regardless of how weird this is, I like it quite a bit. DFH always keeps it weird"
Midas Touch,4.86,"Appearance:
Pours a diaphanous shade of burnished gold blended with vibrant, daffodil yellow. Forms a dense, white froth, similar to the creamed bubbles that crown an authentic cappuccino. Leaves a geometrically perfect circle of sudsy white lacing that thins out the further it reaches, but endures unbroken all the way to the end.

Bouquet:
Bushels of honeysuckle flowers, trailed by a delicate mist of Moscato, puffed cereal grains, freshly sliced Honeycrisp apple, and a trace of orange rind that gently ushers the aroma away from being too sugary.

Feel:
A medium body that's granted manly heft by a foamy, nimbus texture I've never experienced before. Imagine if cotton candy were ghost and that'd put you near the mark of this ale's magical mouthfeel. A caress of sinful silk with a dry, Riesling finish.

Taste:
Honeycomb slathered in sweet, golden nectar. The honey aspect is earthy and intensely real. Not store-bought honey, not honey flavoring, more like: caveman who owns his own beehive, honey. This primal delight is followed by juicy white grapes, a liberal layer of powdery saffron, and a far-off melody of malts melded with tart fruit."
Midas Touch,3.67,"Nice fine head about a finger thick, lots of small carbonation bubbles. Clear gold in color. Smells like white wine/ champagne. It's hard to pin down the flavor, pretty unique. Like a mild bitter ale with hint of white grapes but nothing stands out which is good in it's own way. Finishes pretty dry. Overall, it's decent. Worth trying but not particularly my kind of brew."
Midas Touch,4.14,"Bottled on 6/28/2019, revisiting this classic after who knows how many years.

Look: The beer is translucent with a slight haze. Straw - pale gold. Some visible carbonation. A bone white head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, with some larger bubbles here and there. Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.

Smell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way.

Taste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit.

Feel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out.

Overall: The nose on this beer is great. The flavor profile is a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests, and I’d love more of the grape profile in the flavor. That being said, this beer is very drinkable for 9%, and overall very enjoyable. Happy to have revisited."
Midas Touch,3.73,"Pours a copper-orange with bits of grit and particles suspended within the liquid as if they were frozen in time. Head is a finger and a half of off-white foam with modest retention. Aroma is honey, caramel, orange, tart green grapes, grassy, herbal and floral hops with a bit of biscuity, toasty malts behind. Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, thick and rindy with hearty notes of grapes and honey making for a sweet and off-center brew.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Midas Touch,3.37,"Bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear, medium golden body with a small cap of foamy head. Grainy aroma, malty, reminiscent of some of the emmer or spelt beets in Germany. Taste starts out malty before turning over to some savory, herbal flavors, woody, juniper. I guess the ancient Sumerians had it pretty good..."
Midas Touch,4.16,"Bottled 06/28/19. A light orange color with an odd look due to the tiny specks of suspension. The light carbonation is a nice addition though. No head. The aroma is nice. It does smell sweet like wine. Taste follows the nose and I get some sweetness that would make me think of soda pop almost. The flavors on the tongue are like an orange drink. It tastes good but it doesn't seem beer like at all. The mouthfeel is very nice. I think you pour this into a cup and tell someone it's soda pop and they wouldn't know the difference. That 9% ABV would be a BIG surprise though. Overall an interesting experience that a beer nerd would appreciate from the truly great craft brewer Dogfish Head, Milton, Delaware."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.7,"A 750ml corked and caged bottle, blend°52, season 16/17, bottled on 11th October 2017. Served from a 3 Fonteinen lambic basket, and poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass.

Appearance: A nice clear golden colour with a one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Earthy, oak, rhubarb, light funk, musty, damp wood, hay, apricot, green apple, pear, with sherbet like lemon notes.

Taste: Light to moderately sour, oak, lemon peel, unripe apricot, apple skin, with light funk and notes of hay.

Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Excellent, balanced, complex flavours and really enjoyable to drink."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.5,Fantastic Lambic.
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.46,"First beer of 2022! Poured from a bottle (11Feb2020 - no 37 - 19|20) into a geuze glass

L: pours a turbid, darker orange yellow with a moderate, crackling white head. Moderate visible carbonation feeding the minimal head. Think I stirred the lees moving the bottle from the fridge, my bad. Second glass, while still turbid, is notably less so - more of a brighter, golden yellow. Some chunky lacing left with each sip

S: that classic, seductive 3F geuze nose. Pleasant bit of barnyard funk to open, with some bright fruit notes quickly behind. Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk

T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice

F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip

O: wonderful and tasty geuze. Bright acidity and pleasant, complex funk; solid fruit character, big fan"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.54,"Bottled 11/2/20 750ml
Consumed 12/30/21

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me. The feel is superb with the carbonation and dry finish. Overall I don't know if it's my favorite 3F, but it's up there. Worth picking up a 2nd one if you can get 2."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.9,"#77, good stuff!"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.11,"375 ml corked and caged green bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6%. The cork pops out as son as the ""cage"" wire is opened. The glass fills completely with white foam, and the slightly hazy golden beer appears slowly underneath. INTENSE and lovely aroma of farmhouse kitchen, white wine vinegar and oxidised cider apples. Smaken er intenst sur og snerpende, med preg av sitron og brettanomyces, og en merkbar bitterhet i avslutningen."
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,4.47,"L: Golden/orange with a touch of haze, thin head, and little lacing.

S: Honey, flowers, apricot, a touch of vinegar. Funky notes intermingles as well, some classic Brett barnyard character. Bready malt.

T: Very tart and tangy, apricot, honey crisp apple, honey, and some citrus flavors. Some bready malt on the finish, but stays fruity and sour the whole way through.

F: Moderate body, fine carb but nice crispness. Dry finish.

Overall: An absolute pleasure of a beer. Not super sour either, even for a vintage from 2018. I highly recommend this to any fan of the style."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.07,"Vintage 22A

I remember hearing about OG Gonzo being an awesome beer when I first joined BA. I looked around for it for a while but never ended up finding it. Fast forward 4 years and I end up finding the barrel aged version instead. Let’s see if it can live up to my expectations from all those years ago

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There is a hefty bitterness to the nose here, just really intense. I’m picking up on aromas of herbal hops, toasted oak, cacao nib, earthy whiskey, burnt toast, toffee, and light vanilla

It shows a similar bitterness in taste, but it’s nicely done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, burnt coffee, dark toast, earthy whiskey, herbal hops, light caramel, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of burnt toast, herbal hops, earthy whiskey, toasted oak, cocoa powder, toffee, brown sugar, and light raisin

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a brisk and bitter beer. Finishes slightly sticky but goes down remarkably easy for the abv

It’s nothing amazing like I was told it was back in the day, but it’s a very solidly done beer in the old school fashion"
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.07,"Solid black appearance
Medium light carbonation with about an average body.
Aroma is wood,earthy, roasted malt, boozy with some dark chocolate.
Taste was almost dry otherwise stayed true to the aroma.
This was very good,more dry than expected"
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.31,Pours dark as coal. Nice tan head. The bourbon comes through in the nose and taste. Nice warmth afterwards. Very good stuff.
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.01,"Served a snifter from the bottle.

Appearance: a semi thin dark brown espresso coloured body consisting of dark brown which looks black but is evidently transparent super dark.

Smell: Light liquor aroma which dissipates very quickly.

Taste: From the front a darker chocolate malt coming off with heavy whiskey.

Mouth: Heavy whiskey feel which feels almost like a lighter body imperial stout.

Overall: Great grab which comes off boozy but still worth grabbing. Always in a glass!"
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.17,"2021 vintage. Frothy head and lacing on a chocolate colored beer. Scents of dark malt and bourbon. Dark malt carries over into the taste, some chocolate, a slight tang of booze from the barrel. Medium bodied, a little thin, mild booze presence."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Vintage AA21 poured into a goblet: color is solid black, head is tan with fine and small bubbles, head presents 1-2 fingers thick, head lingers well with a solid top, nice lacing on the sides of the glass.

Smell is bourbon forward with notes oak, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate. Based Gonzo is aroma is tamed by the bourbon barrel aging.

Taste has a more balanced porter - bourbon barrel aging mix: roasted malt, chocolate, coffee are initial flavors with the oak, vanilla, char coming through for the finish.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, moderate bitterness - lingering drying and sweetness.

Overall this brew takes on the bourbon barrel aging in a big way - the base brew is big but the bourbon barrel agin still showcases the oak/bourbon characteristics very well; aroma/flavor/mouthfeel combines for an easy drinkability."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.12,"From a bottle, pours as an opaque black with light carbonation and a creamy brown head that quickly dissipated. The aroma is of roasted malt and molasses. Taste is very much syrupy sweet malt forward. Other reviewers remark on its ""chocolate"" flavor, but I disagree and would characterize it more as toffee and caramel flavors. Hops flavors are missing in action, but that is characteristic of a Porter. Overall, it's an excellent occasional dessert beer, but too much for just every day."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.19,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This nice little imperial pours a
deep coal black with a nice head of brown foam that dissipates to a
thick ring, thin dusty layer, and sports some excellent lacing. Nose of
mild bourbon, char, coffee, dark cocoa, and faint oak with touches of
vanilla. Flavors surpass the nose with char, coffee, tobacco, bourbon,
light vanilla, mild oak, and touches of dark orchard fruits of dark cherry
with touches of earthy malts. Nice mouth feel; full body, light soft carbonation,
warming, and a bitter malt finish.

Overall, a solid brew but not up to what I expected from this legendary series."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.23,"Vintage AA21

A: Pours a deep brown, almost black color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap

S: Roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel, and a touch of coffee

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Picks up plenty of oak, some caramel, coffee, and light leathery tannins. Finishes with lingering bourbon, oak, and leather

M: Medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Very dry

O: A very good BA version of Gonzo. The Willett bourbon really adds a nice depth and the oak makes itself very present. Makes for a great sipper at 11.3%. Definitely worth checking out"
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,3.94,"Pours black nice tan head falls slow good lace.

Aroma is muted Gonzo as far as I remember with light barrel notes. Seems little disappointing.

Taste is big though roasted malts, chocolate coffee, barrel notes, vanilla some bitterness from hops. A big ass beer with noted alcohol warming that blend well with the flavors.

Mouhfeel is big medium carbonation is lightly peppy.

Overall suprised the most is muted on this big beer, seems little suppressed compared to regular Gonzo but that's based on old memories."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.24,"Pours black with a 1 inch tan head, which fades to a wisp. Moderate lacing.

Aroma of roast malt, coffee, vanilla, licorice.

Taste is roast malt, bourbon, wood, caramel, nutty. Astringent.

Full bodied, light carbonation. Dry, astringent finish.

An excellent Imperial Porter."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.13,"Dark brown, opaque body; thick and frothy head, creamy and light khaki in tone. Nice deep roasted grain and mild chocolate smell. Rich taste; milk chocolate and cocoa; a tease of bourbon; very mellow bitterness. Heavy body; velvety; an excellent undercurrent of alcohol heat.

The bottle stamp has ""VINTAGEAA21"" and ""MMXXI"" on it. It is Willett Bourbon barrel-aged. The barrel-aging is nicely done, even-handed and subtle yet definitely packing a punch as it augments the inherent ABV of the beer."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.24,"This started solid. Reminds me heavily of high westified and willetized from lagunitas. Sadly its a little too metallic, acidic and thin to buy again. Id buy in a pinch but its no worls class beer.

Well I bought it again. 5/4/22 and I'd be hard pressed to rate anything about this beer better than a 3.75, which is very low for me."
Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Pours pitch black, nearly impervious to light. Fluffy mocha head is slow to recede. Aroma is light, mostly chocolate and boozy. Flavor is rich milk chocolate, dark brown sugar, sweet yet very bitter espresso finish. Bourbon barrel addition really adds a nice depth and complexity. Carbonation lends to a. Ready mouthfeel. Overall a very good BA imperial porter, worth trying.

Gonzo - Barrel-Aged,4.23,"Growler poured into a nonic style pint glass.

Dark brown like oil. Three quarters of an inch of solid, medium-brown foam sit on top. A sheet of micro-bubbles along with oily residue cascades down the side of the glass with every tilt.
Nose is moderate with nice aromas of vanilla, oak barrel, cola-like caramel and biscuit malt that carry through
in the flavor with some roasted malt and a small amount of woody hop flavor. Low to medium bitterness. Finishes with a little warmth.
Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Smooth and a little creamy.
Get some."
Raging Bitch,3.5,"""For optimal freshness enjoy by 9/14/22""; drank 7/2/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through golden appearance.

A rough pour yielded a big khaki head; strong, frothy tree-rung lace.

Fresh soap, mild corn & faint dry wheat notes in the nose.

Sticky medium mouthfeel.

Fresh soap & mild orange peel flavors up front; dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish.

A bit off-putting; not so much a melding of styles, as a clashing of styles. Abrasive."
Raging Bitch,4.25,"Poured on tap at DCA airport in DC. The beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy off-white head. Strong Belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt. Taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end. Like a Belgian funnel throughout, lots of brown sugar, caramel, banana bread, spice. Finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the IPA aspect of things. A really fun take on a Belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises. Recommended."
Raging Bitch,3.36,"A very nice amber pour, an pale yellow meringue head that lingered and some really nice lacing. Boogar factory said Belgian yeast, taste buds said Belgian yeast, brain said ""nope, this won't work"". Medium bodied, great lasting carbonation. I just dont like Belgian yeast."
Raging Bitch,3.32,"Raging Bitch IPA......This beer drinks like a lager not a IPA. Pours a beautiful amber color. Nice head. This is NOT a IPA....Its more a lager. Not very happy. BUT ITS BEER!!!!

3.5 out of 5......If you like lagers, you will love this beer!"
Raging Bitch,4.17,"Pours an opaque copper color with a monstrously thick off white colored head that dissipates unevenly leaving tons of lacing. Smell is floral with the complexities of the Belgian yeast present. Has a strong malt backbone with a balanced tropical fruit taste and bitter finish. Mouth is just shy of syrupy but oh so enjoyable. Can remember splitting a 6 with a work colleague @ lunch and not wanting to get much done after that thus calling it a ""Raging Bitch"" kind'a day. A staple that I always try to have on hand in order to turn friends onto. Love the artwork & name."
Raging Bitch,3.89,"A hazy copper pour, fat head and curtain lacing. Impressive. The nose is quiet medicinal, a bit of lemon. Taste is pungent herbal bitterness, as promised, with pretty solid malts that sit as a firm foundation for the punchy hops. Dry and taxing, this is not one I groove to, but it’s alright."
Raging Bitch,3.73,"2022 re-review

A decent interpretation of a belgian IPA, not really anything to write home about but not terrible. Deffinitely has more of an IPA than a belgian character, that can be a good or a bad thing depending on what youre looking for.

Pours a translucent orange/brass color with a one finger off white head that laces the glass well.
Aroma is bitter and herbal, fairly nondescript besides notes of grapefruit rind and caramel.

Malt bill is strong and competes for control with the hops. Has a sweet caramel / honey / candied orange flavor predominantly. Yeasty belgian flavor only appears on the aftertaste, its nice but not as bold as I would have expected - showcasing decent flavors of banana and very mild clove. Finishes bitter and dry with hoppy notes of orange zest.

Mid weight body. Alcohol profile is moderate, you can tell its almost 9% yet at the same time this is oddly sessionable.

This is an enjoyable beer for sure; I come back to it every now and then when I want something thirst quenching but strong in ABV."
Raging Bitch,2.88,"Light ipa, first sip tastes great, too sweet tho so after a bit gets old. Don't think I would buy again."
Raging Bitch,4.28,3/1/21....pours medium copper amber with light head of off white foam. Cherry fruit and yeasty nose. Spicy fruity flavor. Some cherry. Black currants too. Deep and powerful body. Leaves with an earthy gritty bitter. Solid.
Raging Bitch,4,"Brownish copper in color with a white head. Nose is spices and pungency. Taste follows the nose with a spicy, white pepper dryness that quickly grips the palate with a piney bitterness. Good Beer with a different spin on IPA."
Raging Bitch,3.71,"First off I have to say that I’m not a fan of the name of this beer. It’s 2021 Flying Dog. You can do better.
Pours a deep amber with two fingers of fluffy white head.
Aroma of cooked pear with toffee and some spice. Fruity
Slightly sweet fruit flavor up front balanced by a hoppy bitter finish. I get a lot of pear and citrus with a bit of banana clove spice. Pine hop finish.
I enjoyed this beer but probably won’t revisit."
Raging Bitch,3.79,"L: Pours a clear copper with a white head Nice lacing.
S: I’m picking up clove and fruity yeast
T: Piney hops, Belgian yeast. Interesting.
F: Medium bodied with a dry finish
O: I like the style a lot and this is a pretty good example of it."
Raging Bitch,3.84,"Pours dark amber with a thin white head that leaves much lacing. Aroma is typical Belgian with the fruity/clove notes. Taste is as advertised, sharp fruity flavors, with that Belgian banana/clove background. There is some hoppyness in there too, but the fruit flavors dominate. Feel is also as advertised, sharp and drying. Overall, you get what is advertised, but it's not my favorite, but it is interesting."
Raging Bitch,3.81,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Clear orange colour, big off-white head. Lovely strong aroma of fruity and piney American hops, notes of oranges and slightly caramellized orange marmalade. The flavour is a hoppy explosion from start to finish, fruity (orange marmalade) first, very bitter in the end. There is a considerable malty sweetness that stands up to the bitterness. I don’t get many ""Belgian"" notes out of this ""Belgian IPA"", it is all very American to me."
Raging Bitch,3.96,"12oz bottle. Best by date is stamped on label as '05:23:21'.
Mostly clear, medium amber colored body. One thin finger of white head recedes to thin cap. Leaves some partial lacing walls away from the drinking side.
Aroma of Belgian yeast, with hint of toasted malt and piney hops.
Taste is up front with piney hops, with a good malt base and an expression of the Belgian yeast. Also has some sweeter tropical fruit hops that emerge late. Aftertaste goes to a sweet mellow place with a blend of the main components. Both the initial flavor push and the end game are tasty, although with different emphasis and balance.
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of syrup. Very good carbonation. There is some piney bitterness but not to a burn or stinging experience.
All components get to present and together they work well in a blend and balance. Flavorful IPA, and more distinct because of the yeast smell and taste. Wild side art work on the label."
Raging Bitch,4.07,"Clear copper caramel color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing.

Belgian yeast on the nose with a bit of spice and malt in the background. Maybe a hint of dank hop but its light if its there at all.

Luckily the hoppiness is there in the taste. Dank, piney hops up front with the malty Belgian spice flavors coming through in the finish. At times the flavors almost seem to be competing, but really I think they mostly balance out pretty well. The booziness is well hidden.

Mouthfeel is light and easy to sip with nice, zippy carbonation.

This is pretty nice for something different. Turns out that Belgian flavors and west-coast hop flavors marry pretty well. It's just starting to feel like Spring here and I'd say that's the right time to drink one of these. You don't necessarily want all the tropical hop flavors of a NEIPA, so the roasty malt flavors in this one work nicely when there's still a hint of chill in the air."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.3,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides.

Smell is big, bitter, slightly biting - notes of pine, earth, citrus, juniper, some honey and syrupy notes, light caramel.

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, strong bitterness and slight boozy burn.

Overall - amazed that big, big non-hazy IPAs are this hard to find - so much more nuance, flavor, and drinkability."
RuinTen Triple IPA,3.82,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of caramel malts, pine. Taste is a pine forest, a strong malt backbone, some alcohol, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.05,"6 oz pour on tap at Lures Bar & Grille. Pours a clear caramel color (lighter than a brown ale) with a small head. Aroma and flavor feature dank pine, grapefruit rind, caramel malt, sticky resin, and moderate booziness. Bitterness is offset by malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and moderately carbonated. Overall it's a nice throwback DIPA but doesn't blow me away."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)"
RuinTen Triple IPA,3.85,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through. Pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. It reminds me of the original Hoptimum a little. Not a bad strong ale but I’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things, cheers!"
RuinTen Triple IPA,2.89,"Disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit ABV. Reminds me a little of scotch ales with a strong, dark, almost metallic mouth feel followed by the bitterness. A strong beer that unfortunately did not get better with a second can.
I like Stone beers, but this I won't buy again"
RuinTen Triple IPA,3.76,"Canned April 15th enjoy by August 13th 2022.

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department.

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely.

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with.
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me.

Sticky, somewhat juicy mouthfeel.

Kind of wearing on the palate but I enjoy it."
RuinTen Triple IPA,3.7,Definitely awesome nose and color just has a bit of too much alcohol after taste to it at the end and bitterness lasts for ever
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.31,"So cool they decided to brew this beer again.

Look: Old gold body, nice off-white head.

Smell: Pine, floral notes, orange peel,

Taste: Intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). Some sweet toffee malts mid-palate, fresh squeezed orange juice too. Clean, citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. Wow.

Feel: Very big beer fuller medium to full bodied IPA.

Overall: This beer would be awesome to pair with food. Doesn't make sense to have more than one of these IMO, but this is an awesome West Coast IPA. The kind of IPA that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. And a pretty reasonable price point to boot. If I can find another fresh batch I'm definitely trying this again."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.25,"Pours a clear amber color with a tall head and moderate lacing.

Smells of slightly dank piney hops, sweet fruit and alcohol.

Tastes of dank bitter hops, sweet caramelly malt with a bitter alcohol warm finish.

Medium body and carbonation. Lightly syrupy dry finishing mouthfeel.

This brew is a bitter burly, almost barleywine, West Coast sipper!"
RuinTen Triple IPA,3.75,"This was relatively solid but noy the best triple ipa I've had by far. Very malty backbone, good west coast vibes but just...idk a smidge lacking. I like Lagunitas Waldos more."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.63,Amazing
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.04,Amber color with ample white head. Tons of malt and caramel alcohol sweetness out-competes the bitter hops. Dry pine finish and a hint of lime. Aggressive and weird but good.
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.54,"A big bold bitter ipa. A true tribute to the ruination series. This beer is not for everyone. A very malt forward, West coast ipa. If your palate is training to handle the bitter malt then i highly recommend this one"
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.32,"I dont think i ever had the original.

Look is awesome. Deep amber with great clarity. Whats amazing is rhe syrupy thickness and the way the bubbles slowly rise from the bottom of the glass and just dont stop. I dont think ive ever poured a beer that has this much energy.

Smell is kind of mute.

Taste makes me think I have had this before. Its eerily familiar. Very bitter but not stale or difficult to drink.

Feels ia confusingly dry.

Overall I dont like super high abv IPAs but this one im okay with slow sipping. It might get shitty as it warms though."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.43,"From a 12oz can dated 4/15/22 (canned), 8/13/22 (enjoy by) into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent amber with about three fingers of light tan head. Incredible retention, great lacing. Nice stream of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass.

Smells strongly of pine and resin with a nice tropical fruit background (pineapple?).

Very bitter, piney taste. Nice alcohol warmth. Slight malt sweetness.

Very sticky mouthfeel. Strong bitter aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.

Stone does these big bitter beers the best imho without veering off into malty sweetness. This is a gem of a beer if it's what you like."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.33,"12oz can Packaged 4/20/22 Enjoy by 8/18/22 poured into a snifter at fridge temp 10.8% ABV. The beer pours bright medium amber with sticky khaki colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves rings of lacing. The aroma is candied orange, caramel and pine. The taste is bittersweet caramel malt with resinous citrus and pine sap before the earthy fully bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish that's not cloying, but sticky with hop oil. ABV is well hidden. Overall, excellent."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.42,"120z can into a pint glass. Canned 4/20/22, so not even 3 weeks old. The beast is back!!

Looks splendid in the glass. Crystal clear dark amber body with slow streams of carbonation. The off white head maintains throughout, impressive given the abv. Leaves rings and specks of lacing.

Full hoppy, piney aroma.

On tasting, a haymaker to the tastebuds. Full on strong piney resinous bitterness lasts way beyond the finish. Hints of grapefruit. The malt base is strong, allowing a sweetness to lay under the bitterness without being trampled to death. Abv definitely felt, quite warming in the throat.

Mouth close to full, finish a sweetness and then that building, lasting bitterness.

Overall, excellent big dipa, tipa, whatever you want to call it. Had this as a sample at a Knoxville brewfest some years ago, and was hoping it would return. Appreciate the 12oz can size as well."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.14,"Bottled in a big brown glass bomber a delivered right to my door by cat in the glass
Pours a carob coloured body with nice thick white head
Aroma is big big pine
Citrus caramel flavour"
RuinTen Triple IPA,4,"Had this one on tap, after the Stone Enjoy By 31-10-15, at Ernie´s Tin Bar, Petaluma - and I was about ready for anything. Powerfully and aggressively hopped throughout, but still kind of balanced by the rich and fairly sweet malty base. Good stuff - when you´re ready for it."
RuinTen Triple IPA,4.09,"Tremendous nose of pine and citrus that is impossible to ignore. Taste is citrus hops with a slightly sweet malt body and lingering hop presence on the back end. Medium carbonation and medium-high body with some creaminess.
The ABV works with the beer and the way the brewer handled the hop load, ABV, and finish is fantastic. A truly drinkable triple IPA."
RuinTen Triple IPA,3,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Clear dark orange hue.

Bright white head; strong lace.

Pine & citrus nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Pine, grapefruit & urine flavor. Overly bitter. Not to my taste."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.58,"Likely the best pale ale I've ever had. Just hits every note - perfect balance, ton of flavor. If I could have this in my beer fridge at all times, I would. It just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales I've had. Great citrus flavors, nice body. Surprising high ABV for a pale, which probably helps the flavor profile, but I'm not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.43,"Deep orange in color. No head created, at all. Nose was the least desirable quality, mainly due to not much there, especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. Taste is the magical moment. Superb beer. Surprised it is not considered a NE Style though."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.31,"2022-03-06
16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.

Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.

Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.49,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.

Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.

Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.32,"Pours small head. Disappears into a juice like substance. Classic trillium. They sucks with head.
That’s ok tho because the beer has a great pineapple grapefruit oniony nose.
Flavor is bitter on the front and nice grapefruit and pineapple on the back.
Really delicious. I like the bitterness. Something a lot of northeast IPAs don’t have.
Really good pale overall."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.47,"Yellow, just slightly less bright than orange juice, and totally opaque. White, very soapy head, dissipates rather quickly and doesn't leave much lacing. Sweet, sticky, dank, mango, ripe, pineapple smell, a bit of smarties. Taste follows, just dank, hoppy, herbaceous, grassy, fruity, sticky, berries. Clean mouthfeel, and a floral aftertaste."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,3.64,"draught
Cloudy, medium orange, with some yellow/gold highlights, for the look. Very fruity, tangelo peel and some grapefruit peel, in the aroma. Rather thin bodied & tasting. The flavors are mainly, mixed citrus peel, with just barely enough, medium light, toasted malt, to give it any body whatsoever. So-so."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.9,"#65, yummy!"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.27,Had it at trillium brewing in Boston near Fenway.
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.5,More like an IPA than pale ale. Hoppy and delicious
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,4.16,"Haven't had a straight up ""pale ale"" this good in a while. Really packs a wallop. It has that NE style to it customary to all Trillium ales. Very impressive."

S- grapefruit and other tropical fruits. well balanced

F- juicy grapefruit hop and perfect

M- juicy dry ipa nice. citrus grapefruit has staying and lingering power

O- great great IPA love it. its been awhile since i had a great one."
Broo Doo,4.31,"Bottled 9/28/21

It’s always a treat to find a new-to-me 3 Floyds beer at my local. They’ve been slowly creeping up since they started distributing to Mass last year. This is their annual wet hop IPA, a perfect time of year for it. Let’s pop this baby open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice rings of lacing

The hops in here are so vibrant, but the balance of them against the bigger malt bill is really nice. I’m picking up on aromas of ruby grapefruit, brown bread, caramel, piney hops, white pepper, and orange rind

The same balance exists in taste, but it slightly favors the intense hops. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting resinous hops, white pepper, bready malt, orange zest, and light toffee. The swallow brings notes of pithy grapefruit, dank weed, piney hops, pepper, toasted brown bread, and orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle prickly carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes dry with a firm bitterness

This is a damn good beer. Just what I needed for this type of night. It holds its weight against the other wet hopped beers though skews more towards the hoppy side of things than the others"
Broo Doo,4.24,"Poured from a bottle at fridge temp. Pours a nice murky orange, but not hazy. Just opaque. Minimal white head.

Nose: Overall, the nose was fairly ""light"". Oranges, pine, tropical fruit, and grapefruit peel. Very refreshing and crisp.

Taste: Wow - much more flavor on the taste than predicted from the nose. A nice resin bite hits upfront. This is quickly followed by grapefruit peel, vanilla, pineapple, and bitter hop notes. Hoppy, but smooth. Easy drinking! Refreshing.

Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Overall, a fantastic IPA. I'm very happy to have tried it!"
Broo Doo,4.32,"Bottle received from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a pint glass. It pours a hazy, bright golden apricot color with 2 fingers of creamy, egg white cap and extensive, thick lacing. A fragrant nose featuring lemon peel, grapefruit, pine needles, and a whiff of tangerine. There's also a strong smell of malt in the background. The taste opens with strong hoppy bitterness and resinous pine. In the background there is tart lemon and grapefruit and a hint of sweeter orange. The toffee malt adds depth and some additional sweetness as the ale warms in the glass. It has a great mouth feel: moderately thick and creamy with fairly lively carbonation. And at 7% ABV it's an easy drinker. I'm so happy to have tried this. While we get 3 Floyds distro in New Jersey, it's limited to the year-round offerings and often they aren't fresh. I've had much better 3 Floyds success with BIFS and trades."
Broo Doo,4.4,"Three Floyds is newly distributed to MI so I gladly snagged a sixer of this, especially since there seems to be wet hopped ales lacking in my area. No date seen but assumed fresh (duh).
Poured into a tulip glass. Looks deep golden yellow, bone white head and awesome sticky lacing on the entire glass as the beer goes down.
Orange and citrus aromas, peel, pith and flesh. Pine needles round it out.
Taste is similar. Oranges, grapefruit and lemon zest, floral notes too. Light caramel detected but this is all hops. Big sticky and thick feel. Astringent and building finish.
For as long as this one’s been around my first go at it was impressive. I had three in a row because it was so tasty! This feels and tastes like a classic, old school IPA. Well done and surely a beer I’ll look forward to every year."

Once the mess clears, I'm able to pour what's left (roughly 80%) into my glass. It's a beautiful honey glow with a creamy cap of 1 finger. Rings of lace as it recedes. Very nice.

Aroma from the bottle is hop spoilage and amber malt. Aroma from the glass is much the same with the addition of tangerine and pineapple. More toasted grain.

Flavor brings bright citrus interwoven with amber malt and slight nutty malt. Some hints of citrus peel on the back end. It's flavorful and toasty.

Feel is tight and crisp, with some slight acidity and heavy carbonation. Medium bodied. Alcohol heat is nowhere to be found. Crisp finish.

Overall, this is a very smooth beer. I was unaware of it being an IPA, as the bottle just says ""harvest ale"". Once I logged on I was a bit skeptical of the ""world-class"" rating, but this beer stands up pretty straight. Again, it doesn't make me think ""fall"" but it's very enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely check it out.

Price paid : $1.69 / bottle
Would buy again : yep"
Broo Doo,4.21,"Appearance: Hazy gold, big head.

Smell: Oranges, citrusy.

Taste: Tingly bitterness to start, then mild sweetness backed with solid grapefruit and orange bitterness.

Overall: Very nice IPA from 3 Floyds, I was a little worried it might be too orange juice-like from the aroma, but it was more of a classic IPA with plenty of bitterness. Good stuff."
Broo Doo,4.14,"Letting this warm up some helps it quite a bit. It is more bitter than most harvest ales and it can be quite sharp when cold. Mellows nicely and blends more when warm, although it is still well developed. Nice light orange color (places the mind in autumn) with a little cloudiness. Nice full off-white to biege colored top.
Nice soft fresh hop flavors. No fruit just the sense of freshness and light green flavor of many this time of year. Moderately light body. Can get a sense of the 7% in the drink. but a good feel overall.
This is a nice drink overall. Worth searching for this time of year."
Broo Doo,3.93,"Beautiful copper body, with just a touch of opaqueness and a fantastic off-white head that falls quickly but provides lots of sticky lacing down the glass. This one has sticky, piney, malty West Coast IPA written all over it. And few breweries make better looking non-hazy APAs/IPAs than 3Fs.

Fresh, sweet, malty, piney, floral, citrusy, and pithy on the nose. Some mild tropical fruits in the background. Not a hop bomb by any means -- actually surprisingly subdued -- but what's there is exactly what I was hoping for and expecting in a 3F wet-hopped ale.

Taste follows, and comes through with the resiny, pithy, malty-sweet, grapefruit-bitter flavors. But it comes off a little flat and single-layered. Incredible, pithy grapefruit aftertaste.

Incredibly soft and silky and not sticky at all, past the pithy coating on the teeth. Well carbonated, which adds to the velvety feel, even though the body of the beer is light-to-medium. I actually like a little bit of stickiness and chew in these kind of beers, so the lack of such is my only complaint."
Broo Doo,4.04,"Bottle courtesy if JohnnyHops.
Slightly hazy copper. Moderate foamy head with nice lacing.
Very similar to other IPA’s from 3F. And it’s not a bad thing. The hops tend to be more on the herbal and citrus side with a biscuit malt profile. There does seem to be a fruity cereal component.
Overall: if you like 3 Floyd’s ipa’s you’ll like this. Extra bonus: no stupid ass troll on the label."
Flower Power,4.07,"Pours a rich gold with a rocky white two finger head. Light citrus aroma, maybe some what floral. probably has more but my nose sucks. Taste shows some citrus peel a bit of grassiness and some biscuity malt. Light/medium bodied with a dry finish and mild carbonation. Very tasty warm weather IPA. I’ll be getting this again."
Flower Power,3.99,"Ahhhhh. I get the west coast pine and grapefruit notes, with a touch of new school floral character. Just the right bitterness to finish it off. This was a fun one."
Flower Power,5,Pleasant surprise. So good.
Flower Power,4.5,"Look: best looking ipa i have seen in years. perfect sustained head, vivid sunset

Smell: balanced. floral immediately subsides and becomes a manly almost malty whiff

Taste: really balanced middle of the tongue mellow and then stays balanced w wonderful bitters

Feel: smooth start to finish

Overall: i think this might be the best most balanced beer, not just ipa, i have had in a long time. the brewers know what they are doing and you sense they are deferring, getting out of the way of the ingredients in this masterpiece"
Flower Power,3.75,Pours a hazy gold. Hoppy aroma. Big dank hop body. Fades to a mild bitterness. Thick and syrupy. An old school IPA.
Flower Power,4.35,"12oz bottle into a nucleated pint glass.
L: Pours light hazed apricot color, medium low carbonation, creamy 1"" soft white head w/dents, good retention, random sticky lacing.
S: Sugary Xmas cookie dough, honey, graham cracker, caramelized malts, a hint of dark berries, a trace of alcohol as beer warms.
T: Sweet overripe citrus, brown sugar, lemon zest, plum, persimmon, full flavored and has volume, lightly toasted, moderately sweet w/a light linger.
F: Sharp & tart, lightly tacky med-heavy bodied mouthfeel w/a med-long drying finish.
O: A big tasting and large feeling IPA with enthusiastic amounts of hop tang. It is redolent perhaps of a Christmas Ale in it's depth. Stately, broad and big, it is outstanding in it's style."
Flower Power,3.7,"This is purely subjective. Clearly, it’s a great beer! I got to try this on an endless layover in NYC where it was offered in bottles at the lounge. The honey notes arent a world of flavor I personally love as much, but the beer itself is nice and balanced and a quality zipper — especially when waiting eight hours for a flight."
Flower Power,4.56,"Honey colored with no head to speak of. Nose is slightly sweet, but also a bit pungent. Tasting is where the magic happens. Bitter is the best adjective available, but it is great bitterness that follows through the entire palate. Great beer!"
Flower Power,4.27,"Review 1554

My continuation for beers I usually would not consume. The beer is 44 degrees and served in an IPA glass. The pour created a two-fingered off-white head. The head retention is excellent; it slowly dissipated, leaving some lacing on the glass. An amber yellow with orange hues, charting around SRM 7. This beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles.

I first smell floral esters, pine, herbal, and biscuits. Nosing further, I recognize lightly toasted malts, grapefruit, a hint of dankness, a touch of mango, and pineapple.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, pine resin, herbal, biscuity, lightly toasted malts, pineapple, and grapefruit.

The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.

An excellent IPA Full flavor and bright."
Flower Power,4.28,"Watkin's Glen 25th anniversary trip 6/21/21. El Ranchero restaenjoyed!Very heady, deep lemony aroma and sharp lemon peel bite. Very light mouthfeel with a very bitter ending. Really enjoyed!"
Flower Power,4.68,"Always a pleasure to meet with this old friend. Bronze color, strong hoppy malty smell and taste, definitely not fruity or sweet, long finish. A great classic IPA."
Flower Power,4,"This beer will always be near and dear to my heart.

Flower power paved the way for my introduction to IPAs.

Decided to grab a six pack of this one; since i havent had it since 2015. Man, it was great. NE IPAs can get taxing after awhile so this one was breath of fresh air. Loved the hops in this."

S- Some mild hop pine.

T- Corriander, some white pepper bite.

F- Dry mouthfeel.

O- A great Trappist Ale! Very complex
flavor but very approachable with a
relatively tame abv!"
Orval Trappist Ale,4.25,"I have had this beer many times and much enjoy it. I can’t believe I never actually reviewed it. So here it goes
Poured from a can into tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazed deep amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has amazing retention, slowly fading over time and leaving a ton of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a biscuit malt mixed with lots of coriander and some clove. Along with these aromas comes notes of yeast and apricot as well as a touch of pepper and hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with a nice blend of spice of coriander, clove, and white pepper. Other flavors of yeast and herb are there as well, blending nicely with the malt and spice. There is a bit of sweetness mixed within as well, with notes of apricot, peach, and white grape. The taste remains similar in nature throughout, maintaining a smooth and balanced flavor. A touch of hay joins in at the end, leaving one with a flavorful, but nice crisp and clean taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel- The body is very light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. Fantastic for the style and taste and very easy drinking.
Overall – A great Belgian pale ale. Super flavorful and amazingly easy to drink. Fantastic."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.2,"L - Poured as directed by Orval leaving one centimeter in the bottle. Beautiful caramel-orange color with a three finger creamy head and aggressive carbonation. Head retention is the most I have seen on a beer. High lacing throughout the session.

S - I was surprised at the faintness of the nose. Some spice, citrus pith and malt. But, towards the end of the session, the spice and malt stepped up with a hint of bread. I then realized the beer was too cold.

T - Citrus peel, malt and hop bitterness, which is more pronounced than expected and nicely lingers on the finish. The hop bitterness is interesting because it is so balanced. Unlike other Belgian styles, this ale is only slightly sweet.

F - Medium-full bodied with high carbonation that becomes more tame. Medium dry finish. ABV is not overwhelming but you begin to feel it towards the end of your glass.

O - This is a strange beer for me. My first Belgian anything that was not sweet. Oh, and the bitterness through me for a loop. However, the bitterness was very nice and as the beer warmed, the aroma and flavor increased in layers. Definitely will have this again."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.23,"I’m reminded of valet Chris Rock agape at Eddie Murphy’s dump truck in BHC2: I get $20 for a car, $50 for a limo, WTF is that???

Like nothing I’ve had before. Wild yeast, dry hopped, Belgian fruit notes, slight sweetness, light malt. Tastes like someone mixed a Belgian ale with a British pale ale. Awesome white head and golden body. Pungent spicy aroma. Unique and high quality."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.17,"Bottle at Sabatinis in Exeter pa earlier this evening. 2020 release. Orval Day 2022.

Looks splendid in the chunky Orval goblet. Hazy orange yellow body. Generous white head persists throughout leaving layers of lacing.

Some fruit notes on the nose, and the abv is apparent.

On tasting, strong and full flavored. Quite bitter, some light fruit wafts in and out. Abv seems higher than the 6.9 listed. A little sweetness here and there.

Mouth very full. Finish bitter and a little drying.

Overall, enjoyable drink once the palate adjusts to the bitterness level and can enjoy the nuances. Wouldn't say no to another."
Orval Trappist Ale,3.86,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head that lingers like root beer float. (4.50)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of citrus upfront. Followed by grapefruit, juicyfruit, bubblegum, and bread spice esters. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong and funky flavors here. There's grapefruit and tart pear fruit. Then a strong funky yeast in the middle. A semi-sweet pale malt finish. The funk lingers. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A full mouthfeel with a lingering funk. (3.75)

Compared to Saison Dupont 5/21/22: Pours a darker color, larger head. Stronger aromas. More funky yeast. Less juicyfruit and bread spice. A larger body, and sweeter.

Overall: A lot more barnyard funk on this one that I had expected. Almost overpowering. Granted, this one is about 3-5 years in age. Maybe more than usual wild yeast formed. Hard to get a whole lot of other flavors here because the funk and tart fruit overpower a bit. Not sure if this is normal for this one. I think this one may have been spoiled. Maybe I'll have to try it fresh sometime. (Rating: 3.86)"
Orval Trappist Ale,3.32,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. (Bottled on 08/07/2021, poured on 05/10/2022.) Humongous off-white/bone white head on a not very aggressive pour. Head does not dissipate quickly. It’s frothy and foamy to no end. Lacing stays for the whole drink. It’s a light copper clear color. Incredibly appealing look.

S - Deep malt characteristics up front. Warm baked bread. A little yeast sweetness as well.

T - Taste is lighter than scent. More of a cracker or biscuit malt, with some sourness paired with sweetness. Light fruits come through as well. Maybe a citrus zest. Some earthy tones appear in there. Finish has some mild bitterness and pepperiness. The hoppy bitterness and pepper is more present as it warms up. These dry bitter flavors really overpower the second half of the drink.

F - Medium-to-heavy carbonation, but medium-to-light mouthfeel. Surprisingly dry finish. Almost like a brut champaign. The more I drink it, there’s a lot of dry aftertaste. Which is not appealing.

O - Overall, I love the complexity and mixture of this beer at the start. It begins as a great blend of malts, yeast, and light hops, with none of them overpowering the other. Each taste brings something a little different. Then, as you drink, the bitterness, dryness, and pepper starts to overpower. So much so, that my appreciation diminished by the end. I didn’t even want to take the last two gulps to finish it. Unfortunately, I will not add it to my rotation, and would not recommend in favor of other offerings."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.34,"Bottled Dec 21, 2021. Pours a hazy penny-copper colour with two fingers of thick, white head. It slowly collapses, sticking around a decent amount, into a millimetre (or two) thick dense foam cap.

Spicy and doughy aromas typical of Belgian yeast swirl with a little bit of floral, spicy hop notes. Caramel malt is present in good amount. Slight funky earthy spin, with good leanings towards some lightly musty but fruity affect — grape, apple, and citrus.

Feels like I’ve been waiting my whole life to try a beer like this, fusing my love of crisp pale ales and doughy Belgian ales. Spicy and fruity up front, biscuity and doughy on the back end, medium-low presence of bittering hops throughout that are primarily earthy and floral in quality. The spicy, peppery phenolic character is quite nice, and a little nutty as well, a mix between almond slices and cloves, white peppercorn and coriander. Citrus zest and peel is noticeable on the back half of each sip, and adds both a fresh quality and adds to the bittering presence of the hops. A beer that lets each note rise before melding into the next one before melding into the next one, which gives this beer a remarkably balanced taste profile. Grassy, zesty, earthy, mildly funky. The funk is stronger on the nose than palate.

Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation, fairly effervescent. Long, doughy and yeasty finish that leaves impressions of bitter hop and lemon peel on the edges of your tongue and hints of phenolic spice. Finishes dry.

A Belgian Pale Ale… Finally! I love PAs, and I absolutely adore Trappist ales. Combining the two, amazing! When the LCBO finally got a new batch in I could have it for the first time! This is a very fresh batch that I need to grab about 5 so I can cellar them and come back to this review every couple of months. Great fusion of flavours. I can see this mellowing and evolving over the years, though I imagine there’s likely a Goldilocks zone before it gets too aged it mellows out the great yeasty phenols as well as the grassy, fresh hops that are present in higher amounts than almost any other Trappist ale and most Belgians in particular. Lovely ale"
Orval Trappist Ale,4.21,"I've read the previous review by illtexzona , and agree that freshness has to do a bunch with quality. the Whole Foods in my neighborhood started carrying Belgian & Trappist things & most recently Orval. I bought 2 almost immediately- probably the freshest Orval Ive had, & it's a completely different animal than the ones at the other most reputable liquor store- totally worth the (recently inflated) price."
Orval Trappist Ale,3.75,"Bottled April 8/21.
Pours a clear orange amber colour with teaming fluffy off white head. a bit of haze as got some dregs at last of pour.
Fruity funky aroma - earthy hops, definite Brett effect - grape, lime, ripe apple - fruity esters, bubblegum and a touch of band aid.
Taste follows with a funky fruity sweetness, that somehow manages to be tart and a bit spicy; notes of lemon, bubblegum, and at the back an aggressive bitterness that mixes with an herbal sweet-tart flavour.
Exceptionally effervescent carbonation, boldly bittersweet and funky with a dry finish. Have had before and frankly enjoyed more - I feel I did not hit the sweet spot of age for me."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.27,"I'd call it a deep honey color liquid with marshmallow fluff filling the glass. It is a little hazy but you can still see thru it. The head stubbornly falls to a dollop, but is leaving huge residue on the glass.

The aroma is fruity banana esters, slightly sweet, a bit of bubble gum. White grape, some extremely mild funk, some earthy brett. A bready note supports all of the aromatics. Maybe a little lemony citrus to cut through the rest and liven it up some.

The taste is intriguing. Not at all what I expected from the nose. It is really soft. I get the esters and bubblegum notes first with a lovely malty sweetness, but with further sips the aromatic notes recede a bit and it lays even more more malty and spicy. It strikes me more like a wild ale, quite yeasty but with more than enough malt to tie everything together. If it is funky at all, it is very laid back. There is spiciness that seems like a bit of coriander and a hint of anise. It's fairly phenolic giving it a nice peppery sensation. Noticeable amount of bitterness on the finish, and there is a lemon note that lingers and helps reset the taste buds.

I'd call the body medium, lively carbonation, pretty dry. The bitterness, while evident, is pleasantly mellow.

It's unique - and somehow everything that is going on plays nicely in the sandbox to deliver a highly enjoyable drinking experience that I really can't put into words. This is certainly a case where the gestalt matters. It's fun, makes me happy."
Orval Trappist Ale,3,Overrated.
Orval Trappist Ale,5,"Orval it’s a classic and Unique Trappist beer. With golden brown color, high carbonation, and amazing head retention! Aroma Wiest sweetness and Wood and a flavor of Slight malt yeast and have a woody bitterness that comes through. Cheers!"
Orval Trappist Ale,3.83,"Served from the bottle in a Boulevard tall tulip.

Pours a partly hazy sunrise auburn topped by over a finger of bone foam. The nose comprises sharp hay, dry biscuit, grass, sweet flowers, and funky wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish. An enjoyable Trappist treat that gets even more interesting with more age on it (4 and 5 years seem to be damn solid right now)."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.08,"Bottled 2/9/2021

L: Amber body with a massive frothy head

S: Barnyard, Belgian yeast, earthy, hay, vinegar, slight bubblegum and clove

T: Medium bitterness, barnyard funk, bready, spice

F: High carbonation, medium bodied, clean and slightly dry finish

O: Unique and complex drinking experience"
Orval Trappist Ale,4.28,"Bottle bought in 2016, finally opened 1/3/2022.

A - Pours copper orange, mostly transparent but some haze with the yeast, short white head, persistent cap, some lacing but not much.

S - Brett up front, bandaids and acidity, apple and white wine, grape highlights. As it warms, the Brett recedes and a powerful bubble gum sweetness comes forward.

T - Follows the nose, but with the acidity, fruit and a touch of bitter pith front, and the Brett coming in beneath. The plastic and barnyard notes are there but they work as a part of the whole.

M - Bright brisk carbonation, light weight, slick feel, clean finish.

O - A rock solid drinking experience, 5+ years in the making. Quite happy I opened this one up."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.18,"Bottle dated 8/7/21, drank 1/1/22

This is the probably the freshest Orval I've ever drank. I'd compare it to drinking a young lambic, and how it mellows out and flavors change over time. Young Orval pours with a ton white foam in the middle and whispy head around the edges. Tons effervescent carbonation and grassy hops. The belgian yeast hasn't had a lot of time to take over yet. I've had this beer several times and now I want to do some side by sides with aging after having this fresh one."
Orval Trappist Ale,4.8,This is probably the best beer on the planet. No two Orvals taste the same; every bottle offers a unique experience. You can drink it fresh or aged. I am currently imbibing an Orval bottled in April of 2020 and it is out of this world. These Brewers from Brasserie d'Orval only need this single offering and its humble labeling to show what true Masters they are.
Orval Trappist Ale,4.03,This was stupid carbonated to me but I was forced to drink it out of the bottle at the time. That said it heavily reminded me of champagne and I look forward to putting this in a glass next time
Orval Trappist Ale,4.15,"Pour is highly effervescent with a lot of white foam. Smells like raisin and is very smooth heft on the palate. Tastes phenolic with slight brown sour dough bread with slight hops. The 6.9 ABV is hidden well. Overall, complex & smooth; I like it!"
Orval Trappist Ale,4.56,"Appearance: Cloudy, muddy copper. Pours to a massive frothy off white head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Lots of funky, yeasty aromas.

Flavor: Moderate bitterness. Spicy & earthy.

Mouth-Feel: Light to medium bodied, a little creamy. Pours highly effervescent, but releases the carbonation nicely. Drying, moderate length finish with a mild trailing bitterness.

Overall: This would be consider a ""young"" beer. Bottled in May 2021, drank in November. It still has the yeasty, hoppy character that mellows with age. Curious how this will taste about a year or two down the road. Pours super carbonated, producing a huge, fluffy off-white head, but seems to release the carbonation better than other Belgians. Makes it a little more drinkable. Very nice."
Two Hearted Ale,4.68,"One of our Michigan beers, this is a staple, every party store and gas station has it, I like IPAs, this is bitter, I like that, it stays on the tongue, I like that.....
If you like this, try Huma Lupa Licius by Shorts."
Two Hearted Ale,4.54,"American IPAs are rarely my first pick, but I think it's because I find myself wishing that every other American IPA was this one.
Gorgeous hazy amber color, and foams and laces beautifully- it's a very good looking beer. If it were a person I'd buy it a pint of itself. Smells piney. Actually drinking it does not disappoint. Flavor's got layers- good hops, pleasant little grapefruit and pine notes, all backed up by good malt. As for mouthfeel, it's good. I almost wish it was a little less carbonated, but would never suggest messing with the delicate balance of a beer so close to perfect. I'm a big fan."
Two Hearted Ale,4.17,"Look is dark orange/amber, smell is of candied orange, hop resin, slight pine. Taste is more of the candied orange and hop bitterness. Really solid IPA, definitely a unique taste on this one in regards to the soft orange taste, very west coast IPA."
Two Hearted Ale,4.3,"Pint can poured into a DuClaw Brewing pint glass at fridge temp.
Amber/gold color, slight haze, fantastic foam.
Using a distinct single hop (Centennial), Two Hearted Ale has a delicate orange blossom citrus aroma, assertive but well-balanced bitterness, and a lovely supporting crystal malt base.
Great everyday beer.
Goes well with anything."
Two Hearted Ale,4.8,"The gold-standard of IPA, the first IPA I’ve ever enjoyed, which in my mind is what every IPA should inspire to be"
Two Hearted Ale,5,"Age: 4 months from packaging.

Look: A Touch hazy, not crystal clear. Amber in color and beautiful head of lacey foam.

Smell: Malty hops. Pleasant.

Taste: The surprising malty background blew me away. I love a good malt but to see it shine in a IPA was kind of nuts. I enjoy the taste. The malt and hops are balanced well.

Feel: The lingering malt feel on the tongue is pleasent. There is not a bitter bite to it like you would expect, its there but not enough that you couldn't session this beauty.

Overall: I love it really. Its going in my rotation. What Ive found is that after some hazy beer, double IPA, etc, throwing this malty IPA in the mix just completes the circle. Its great. Thanks Bell's."
Two Hearted Ale,3.34,"Pours a hazy, deep yellow with very good carbonation and a light, airy head. Aroma is citrus and pine, with perhaps a very slight hint of grapefruit. Taste is light, largely bright, perfectly balanced between bitter and refreshing. The citrus comes through strongly, followed by pine."
Two Hearted Ale,3.59,"I’ll start by saying that I am NOT an IPA guy. I’ve tried a few but just cannot appreciate whatever is going on with that. However, I heard the hype on this and wanted to give it a short. My initial smell is heavy of pine and citrus with just a hint of malt. The flavor is the same. I get a pleasant pine taste and it reminds me of a chilly fall morning sitting in a tree stand waiting for a buck to walk by. The finish has a mild malt flavor and a medium dry finish. It’s not too bad and the only IPA I’ve been able to stomach. I bought a 6pack just for my own edification, in hopes of understanding the genre better."
Two Hearted Ale,4.86,The gold standard against which to judge American IPA's.
Two Hearted Ale,4.9,"L: Hazy golden nectar with a small white head that dissipates into a film and a ring around the glass.
S: Yeast rolls, caramel, citrus fruit, pine resin, all the hallmarks of the best American IPAs.
T: Same as smell, but way more intense, as the bitterness is incredibly pronounced, as it should be with an IPA. Pine resin is popping out here.
F: Carbonation on the high side, but between that and the bitterness, the alcohol is very well masked. Medium heavy body.
O: Fantastic old-school IPA that isn't overly fruity or sweet. Highly recommend to everyone who wants a world-class IPA with no BS."
Two Hearted Ale,4.57,The gold standard of IPA’s.
Two Hearted Ale,3.77,"Tried at Prohibition Kitchen, 4/19/22"
Two Hearted Ale,4.58,"Yummmm. this is a great IPA. The favors include an initial earthy taste, finished with grapefruit zest. I like this beer very much. I first had it in the Ann Arbor. So glad they sell is locally in MA. Even after 20 minutes, the taste and look remain."
Lou Pepe - Kriek,4.64,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

2018. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes."

Notes of oak barrel, lemon lime and funk. Great Brett character with a clear distinct taste of New Zealand hops."
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),4.38,"750ml capped bottle into Tired Hands stemware.

Nose is soap, oak, lemon, and a tart hop and citrus bite. Incredibly lively and aromatic and really tickles the tongue. Beer opens pear, citrus, a touch of lime, and lemon zest. The wine barrels are apparent towards the middle and end and lend a nice tart, oaky character. A slight hop bitterness seeps in at the end. Finishes lemon zest, oak, and wood. Delicious. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and almost airy going down. Super drinkable with a clean, slightly dry finish. Incredibly drinkable.

One of the most quaffable beers I've had in a long time. Absolutely delicious."
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.58,"Really good imperial stout! Pronounced coffee smell and taste, but not overpowering in regard to either. Really nice and balanced vanilla and almond flavor!"
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.75,"Seconds after drinking, taste biscotti soaked in coffee. Not too sweet, all features fit stout profile. Excellent."
Imperial Biscotti Break,3.72,"Pours a pitch black with 2 fingers of mocha foam. Sheets of lacing reduce to a thin ring. Nice oily legs on this one. Nose is bitter coffee, chocolate, earth, and biscuit. Taste follows suit with the addition of some nutty notes and Vanilla. Feel is oily, smooth, and quite full. Another good one from Evil Twin."
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.81,You can smell and taste the biscotti so good not overly winey like old coffee that some imperials have. Very smooth velvety mouth feel. I don't pour for head so i can't speak to that. You could wash down a donut or cinnamon roll with this my favorite stout right now.
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.21,"EvilTwin does a nice job with this one. Don’t slap IBB with the “another gimmicky pastry stout” label. This beer is complex and well balanced. Bakers chocolate, dark coffee beans, and roasted malts on the palette, finishing with a rich nutty earthiness and just a tinge of vanilla. Pick one up if you see it in the local shop!"

Imperial Biscotti Break,4.5,"Pours a very dark color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has generous coffee and chocolate hints
The taste follows the nose with a well balanced coffee and chocolate flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A great Imperial Stout"
Imperial Biscotti Break,3.99,"Presentation: 16 oz. can with a batch number on the bottom but no dates. Served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: The tan, one and a half finger head stays around for a bit and leaves behind a lot of lacing that covers the entire glass. It's a deep, black color.

Smell: It's a strong, sweet aroma at first of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and even raisins. There's also some coffee in there as well as honey roasted almonds.

Taste: It's a warm flavor of heavily toasted bread, coffee and a touch of roasted nuts in the aftertaste. It's mostly bitter all around with not much sweetness, if any, coming though. 

Mouthfeel: It's quite thick and moderately smooth but there's a medium high carbonation crispness in there too that's very noticeable. 

Overall: A delicious beer with a lot of character and complexity. The texture is not bad, exactly, but it has a lively carbonation that's not expected for the style. It doesn't ruing the beer but it would be better served by a smoother, lower carbonation mouthfeel."
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.32,"About as dark as can be with an average size tan head. Very sweet fragrance: chocolate, brown sugar, coffee & roasted malt. Sweet but not as much as expected. Very complex & delicious flavor: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, rich & complex roaster malt flavors, mild earthyness & a fair amount of alcohol. Mild mouth & stomach heat with adequate carbonation. Medium viscosity. Evil Twin makes some outstanding beers & this is one of them."
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.34,"Canned 11/16/20

You know it's odd with this one. I was intrigued when I saw it on the shelf so I said fuck it and just picked it up without much thought. I figured it was a fun, but ultimately throwaway pastry stout. It is only now that I come to review it that I realize it's actually held in pretty high regard here. Hopefully then I'll be getting something that's less gimmicky than I expected

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dark khaki head that fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing

This definitely has a defined sweetness in the nose, but it's hidden behind a pretty substantial roast. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy fudge, roasty espresso, creamy vanilla, earthy whiskey (weird bc it's not barrel aged), and some general nuttiness

There is also an incredible balance taste-wise between the dessert aspects and the straight up roasty stout notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting toasted almond, roasted malt, lightly acidic coffee, milk chocolate, and rich vanilla. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of fudge, soft oak, rich vanilla, dry roasted peanut, and roasted malt

A medium full body pairs with mild tingly carbonation, resulting in a super silky beer that never feels bogged down by the abv or the sweetness. Finishes mostly dry with a sweetness that slowly fades

For a non-BA imperial stout, this had a ton of complexity. Even with what some might consider ""unnecessary adjuncts"", this beer impressed me quite a bit"
Imperial Biscotti Break,4.19,"Dark color, small, and light colored head. Smells of espresso and coco, light alcohol. Feels very light and carbonated, not like typical stout. Flavor is strong to start, then eases into a nice biscotti after taste."

Gggreennn!,4.74,"From a 16oz can dated 5/26/22 into a tulip. Can message: 5 More Games. Go Celtics!

Pours an opaque pale orangish yellow with about three fingers of white head. Amazing retention and lacing.

Crack of the can is big pineapples, oranges, some grass and a hint of melon and peaches.

Getting citrus peel in the taste-very nice bitterness-along with some of the aforementioned fruits. Well balanced taste.

Soft, full-bodied mouthfeel. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Wonderful beer to experience. Green or Gggreennn? Tough call to make..."
Gggreennn!,4.66,"TGIG. Tree House makes some funky fruity stuff that so far I've had some difficulty ""appreciating"". Just had a few bad sips of one such bitter fruit bomb. Then switched to GGGreennn! Like aloe on a burn. Yeah, I""m still not totally comfortable with the beige (or ecru?) color with a lot of these types of beer, but the suds look great, the smell is good, the taste is great. Ahhhh."
Gggreennn!,4.31,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.

Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.

Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.

Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics."
Gggreennn!,4.24,"16oz can at share. Hazy yellow golden pour with a small foamy head. Aroma is fruity, tropical, green. Taste adds some dank notes to the fruity, tropical, citrusy base with a hefty helping of bitterness."
Gggreennn!,4.68,"I wish I had both Very Green and this and could go back and forth to compare. Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do? Can not wait for another excuse to be in Western, Mass."
Gggreennn!,3.95,"Cloudy OJ color with three fingers of dense, yellowed head. Great retention and soapy lacing.

Big pineapple and Orange Julius in the nose. A hint of savory Italian herbs below.

Some of the pineapple carries over to the taste, but there’s a lot more lime, white pepper and pithy bitterness here. A little orange juice peaks out under the pith every once in a while in the aftertaste.

Full bodied and slick with strong carbonation.

Not bad, but the lime and pith combo is a touch too strong to my preferences."
Gggreennn!,4.72,"Poured into a 20 oz Snulip glass canned on 2/15/22. Pours a very attractive yellow orange with a finger plus sticky white head that leaves thin bubbles of lace with excellent retention. 4.75

Aroma ripe honeydew, guava, candied tangerine, and apricot really nice. 4.5

Taste follows guava, tangerine, honeydew, and apricot really well balanced. 4.75

Mouthfeel is above average, soft gentle creamy mouthfeel, not dry or sticky, and at 7.5% it drinks bigger in flavor, but goes down very easy. 5

Overall another amazing beer experience from this awesome brewery. Another huge wow factor. 4.75"
Gggreennn!,4.04,"Pours an opaque OJ yellow, frothy 1.5"" white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full. Was hoping for more resinous punch here given the reviews, but any ""greenness"" takes a backseat."
Gggreennn!,4.27,"Canned 12/23/21. Green indeed. Earthy, piney, grassy, lime peel, grapefruit pithy. Super dry. I assumed this was a juice bomb based on the haze but this is anything but. New school look with old school flavor."
Gggreennn!,2.24,"So i chugged 3 of these, and they smelled and tasted foul, hence the need for a funnel. I also didn’t love how it felt, so I was originally thinking 2 there. It did look amazing in the funnel, so there is the 5. Then I blew chunks all over my date, and that made me feel like a 1. So overall I give it a 2, because it was funny to see all the chunks in my girl’s hair.

Addendum: My girl just said she got some GGGreennn in her mouth and it was good, so i raised the taste to a 3."
Gggreennn!,4.23,"Darker yellow thick haze with a white head appearance, decent lacing. Taste has strong hops in juicy matrix with lime, lemon, weedy and leafy hops, melon rind, papaya, aftertaste is grapefruit pith to the max. Smell more weedy hop centric with grapefruit and lime being the leading fruits. Hope has lush haze but the hops are a little green in the middle of it all, otherwise classic tree house. Much prefer very green but still a good neipa"
Gggreennn!,4.69,"“Green for Christmas” 12/23/21
I made the mistake of drinking a Jjjuliusss before this beer, based solely on ABV%…we’re so spoiled now. I’ve always loved Green and Very Green was simply incredible. So…massive resin, super earthy, but all the Green you know and love. TH just doesn’t miss."
Gggreennn!,4.23,"16oz. can into a Founders snifter. Shared with schen9303.

Muddy but with a real nice head and excellent lace. Nose is malt, citrus, mango, grass, and a slightly acidic and sweet juice. Aromatic. Beer opens citrus, mango, and starfruit. Clean and bright. I get notes of more citrus, dry, slightly grassy with loads of grapefruit. End of more citrus and mango. Very good. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down dry and filmy. Bone dry going down with a long, lingering finish.

Very good but this is a touch disappointing given how good Green is."
Vintage Ale,4.66,"Had 2010 bottle that has been cellared 12 years. At last I finally got to try this one, only took coming to London itself! Pours dark brown and murky with a short lived tan cap. Nose has a sherry note to it, the wife say cognac, either way this sweeter booziness is met with caramel, oxidized apricot, date, barley, and leather. Taste adds a bevy of dark fruit, golden raisin and a kiss of fresh cut hay on the end with the old yeast. So luxuriously smooth, sneaky light, quenching, and dry with a whisper of resin. This one is special for its style. Paired wonderfully with a pub sunday roast"
Vintage Ale,4.21,"2019 vint, bottle 06240.
Poured at fridge temp into a snifter.
There’s a casual head that lasts only a little while. Color is dark amber.
Smell is sweet malt, stone fruit, light caramel.
Taste is cherry-ish, sweet toffee. Hops are evident, but balance well within the overall profile. No real bitterness to be found.
Feel is light carbonation, smooth.
Overall, despite being bottle conditioned, I can’t imagine that anything else would develop by cellaring this beauty any longer. It’s packaging, presentation, look, feel and taste are spot-on right now."
Vintage Ale,4.21,2016 Vintage drank in 2022. Amazingly rich flavor and solid carbonation. Complex and delicious!
Vintage Ale,4.5,"2021 Vintage, bottle #139563....

A- Pours a lovely orange hued dark bronze color, is semi opaque, and the head, which is about two fingers thick, shows a shade of creamy white with toffee infusion. The carbonation appears to be somewhat mellow, with only a few columns slumbering there way upward, with the lacing showing rather well and stickily. I am being painted a grouping of cave art like animals around the inside of the glass....very nice looking overall!

S- Heavy malt profile here, with plenty of caramel/toffee sweetness, dark fruit flesh, such as plum and fig richness, various citrus nuances (tangerine, blood orange, grapefruit, pomello), and a sweet alcoholic nature, of rum soaked raisins. The finish has some interesting fruity bitter hops, which would explain what I read about the experimental CF182 variety being used here....I even detect some pineapple tropical like aromas on the end!

T- Very well balanced overall, with a wonderful blend of toffee/caramel malt sweetness, rummy raisin/plum/fig richness, slight orchard fruitiness. After I get through all of this, my palate is hit once again by a second round of malt bomb....full of sweet cooked brown sugar, dark toffee, molasses, sugarcane, and dulce de leche. The finish showcases some very British flavors found in traditional pale ales.....zesty citrus peel, tropical fruitiness and dry leafy herbal tones, quenching the palate and leading me on to want more!

M/O- I,ve enjoyed aged vintages from Fullers before and this is the first time I've had one right after release....I have to say that I am impressed with the overall flavors and richness for something so ""fresh"". The carbonation is smooth and allows the full flavors to release onto the palate gently, while the body is somewhere in the medium-full range. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden and soft for an 8.5% brew, but I don't believe this would be something with a high drinkability factor....one is plenty in a sitting. I appreciate the usage of experimental hops and the attempt to create something unique, which I think fits the bill here.....overall this is an exceptional English style Pale Ale, and would become a great Old Ale after several years of aging!"
Vintage Ale,4.18,"This one isn’t hog wild - and it isn’t supposed to be. But what I feel, what it does to me is remind me of a gentle moment. A moment with her; not the one that was meant for me, but one that still gave me that night and made me feel. I’ll always remember you, baby, even if you aren’t in my trophy case.

Be well, my children."
Vintage Ale,3.39,"500 mL bottle. Vintage 2020. Pours murky amber. Smells of... cardboard right off the bat. Spicy hops with some berry fruitiness behind it. Deep caramel undertones. Tastes of sweet caramel with a combination of spicy and, again, berry fruity hops. Cardboard isn't as noticeable here, as it's got a pronounced hop bitterness. Still has a little bit, though. Medium heavy, fairly sweet. Not boozy, but hits hard after a few sips. I picked this up because I haven't seen one in a long time. My memory of this is fonder than the current experience."
Vintage Ale,4.34,2021 vintage excellent
Vintage Ale,4.37,"Teste licorice, smoke, sweet pastry. Smells berries. Light carbonation, small head. Color is cloudy black tea."
Vintage Ale,4.24,"Beautifully clear copper-red under a well-retaining khaki head that slowly settles to an unevenly bubbly yet flat collar.

While it may be mildly unfair for me to rate this 2010 bottle straight up, it's clearly intended for extensive aging, which I don't feel caused it much detriment anyway.

That said, it exhibits distinct characteristics of grape and prune, and as such lands well within the intended range of emulating wine. These characteristics are accented by softly light notes of pumpernickel and melba toast before exhaling floral tobacco.

The body is smoothly slick with a lightly soft carbonation that fines out into a faintly tingling, slightly numbing, semi-dry finish. Over time, that leafy, floral tobacco verges into cigar skin to delicately dry the palate out further."
Vintage Ale,4.28,"Amber with a touch of red and a finger of tan foamy head. Cherries, tart apples on the nose with caramel, tangerine, almond toffee, and malt at the end. You really have to work to pick things out though. The caramel and malt show up big in the taste. There is bread pudding with raisins and brown sugar. Medium bitterness closes this out. The feel is light carbonation and a nice creaminess. I love the bread pudding aspect of this. I would totally drink this again and would recommend."
Vintage Ale,4.76,"2020 Vintage

Nice traditional and luxurious packaging, nice collectible bottle. Pours a lovely deep mahogany, slightly hazy, with two smooth fingers of off-white, beige-tinged head that recede slowly, and shockingly stick around for the entire pint despite the 8.5% alcohol content, which took me over 20 minutes to finish. The smell whollops you over the head with fruits like blackberry and plum. Ethanol is present but far from obtrusive. The dark fruit profile carries forward into the taste, complemented by marmalade, chocolate notes, subtle caramel, and even subtler earthy, zesty hops. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk, the ethanol noticeable - at 8.5% there's no way around that - but incorporated into the flavour profile. Overall, a delicious, complex, smooth, and very special beer."
Vintage Ale,4.51,2011
Vintage Ale,4.08,"2014 Vintage

Appearance - Pours hazy and burnt amber in color. Sandstone colored, finger width head that holds for a minute or so before scaling down to a thin, broken layer of suds on the surface, thickening up around the edge of the glass. Fair lacing, with some streaky lines and small spots making up most of it.

Smell - Raisin and toffee upfront, with some caramel, oak, nutty character and some booze.

Taste - Follows the nose. Toffee and raisin hit the palate first, with lesser caramel, oak and maybe even a hint of chocolate mid-taste. Finish adds some mild, acidic, booze and a bit of almond, reminiscent of sherry, and the aftertaste is a nice, easy blend of the aforementioned flavors easing out slowly.

Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with low carbonation. Drinks smooth enough, though does seem a bit thin. Perhaps due to the 7 years of age it's been afforded.

Overall - Nice old ale. It doesn't quite do it for me like North Coast Old Stock, which is more full-bodied and flavored, but it does have some similar qualities. I wouldn't mind trying this fresh, or with a few years of age on it, though it looks like they change up the hop profile every year."

Vintage Ale,4.33,2011
Vintage Ale,4.01,"2019 vintage

Pours a slightly hazy but mostly translucent light brown with amber and ruby hues when held to light. An aggressive pour yields 1.5 fingers width of slightly off white colored head. Aroma is massive fruity esters plus a sugary sweetness, reminiscent of a candy apple. I also get huge huge caramel and toffee (maybe it’s more reminiscent of a caramel apple; maybe both). An almost bubblegum note, like that of belgium yeast. Very subtle earthy hop notes. Quite a complex and wonderful nose. Taste is notably less decadent, not nearly the sugary sweet or fruity notes. Lower end of moderate degree of bitterness, pretty big nobel hop notes. Some caramel and an almost woody character. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, ABV is unnoticeable and it is very drinkable for the ABV. I do wonder if the lighter mouthfeel and higher carbonation prevent some of the flavors from reaching their full potentials. Overall, this is a good beer but not one I think I would be prone to revisit fresh. Probably worth a cellaring for several years though, best by date looks like 10 years so may just have to pick up another and give it some years.

Feel: It has a full body, but is not quite chewy. The malt dominates in the palate from start to finish. Plenty of strong alcohol warming.

Overall, there are plenty of complex flavors and the hops add an new dimension to this style."
Vintage Ale,3.68,"2018 vintage: “A celebration of Fuller’s long-lasting friendships with the hop growers, merchants, and maltsters of the UK. It has been brewed using exclusively home-grown ingredients. The beer’s passionfruit, grapefruit and mango notes might be synonymous with the ‘new-world’ hops of America and Australia, but the beer’s tropical flavours, in fact, come from the British Olicana® variety. Alongside Olicana®, Ernest hop from Kent has been added to the brew – a variety that brings apricot, citrus and spicy notes. There are also herby, pine and earthy flavours to discover, from the classic combination of Target, Goldings, Challenger and Northdown hops. As all Fuller’s malting barley is sourced exclusively in the UK, the malts are also in-keeping with the British theme of this year’s recipe. Vintage Ale 2018 sees the return of Maris Otter malt, a key feature in many Vintage Ale recipes of years gone by. Crystal malt, meanwhile, lends the beer its rich biscuit sweetness.”

A: Pours a nice dark amber color with a very creamy looking off-white / tan colored head. The retention is only OK but lacing is very good.

S: Smell is medium to strong intensity. Strong scotch-like apples and pears with a very strong malt base with notes of biscuit, toffee, banana bread. The aging and hops interaction also bring strong notes of figs, dates and prunes. Light amount of baking spices with mostly cinnamon and cardamom as well as a light mint. Very coherent and good.

T: Strong intensity. Strong malt attack with a ton of biscuit and sticky pudding. It develops into a strong prunes and figs flavor and finishes with a strong burnt sugar / caramel / toffee note that lingers for a long long time.

M: Absolutely fantastic for the genre and ABV. It's medium to heavy in body with a low carbonation. It's very creamy and isn't too sticky considering the flavor profile.

O: This is an excellent beer from one of my favorite genre. I think it's underrated mostly because the style isn't too in fashion these days. Excellent."

The nose is pretty lively here. The Belgian yeast lends notes of banana, pepper, and light bubblegum. There’s minor notes of lemon and honey to support the yeast

Hmmm, this is more tart than I expected on the front end. Right off the bat I get tart lemon and mild pepper. Post swallow brings more of the same, but layers in sweet malt, light hops, and orange. Quite tasty actually

This has a medium body and very light carbonation, leading to a smooth and refreshing drink. It finishes a bit too sticky for my taste, but it works out in a beer like this

This was actually pretty good. I haven’t had many strong Belgian pales, but I might have to start seeking more out"
Matilda,3.84,"Bottled and purchased from Altrincham town Tesco store
Pours a slightly hazy mud brown body with with decent enough off white head
Aroma is candied peel and distilled grain
Flavour has that with a lovely tartness"
Matilda,3.97,"Okay - I don't write connoisseur reviews. That said -- I like this beer because it isn't over the top hoppy, but still has that bite. I haven't seen many people describe it as a farmhouse ale, but that's how I would best describe it. The ABV seems a little stronger than 7%, but I'm not on my ass after a few. Not your ""after yard work"" beer; it's not what I would call ""refreshing"" -- more after you have showered and are getting ready for dinner. All things said, I would probably opt for Sofie, but Matilda is right after. My only disappointment -- they changed the label. The label below was classic!"
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.75,"2016 Vintage(I Think)

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV
O: Overall this beer is quite good. It has also held up well over time. Complexity also grows as the beer warms. It's definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.9,"#105 Love it, Apple really come thru!"
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.26,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

Reviewed from notes. Reviewed 1/12/19. 2018 version."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.5,"Really enjoying this. Much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. The apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas I feel I lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. Namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.

Its not terribly complex. Taste like a very simple, basic, strong old school RIS with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy. Quite thick and very hot."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.79,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.58,"I have never really been a fan of the apple brandy BA stouts. The apple character has always been an odd mix for me. I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer."
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.65,I’ve had a majority of the highest rated/reviewed Prairie Stouts. Probably all of them in the top 250. This is easily the best one of the bunch. Everything is superb!
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,5,Maybe ny all time favorite stout ever. Apple pie and coffee in a glass.
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,4.45,"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy.
You MUST let this warm to experience the full flavor profile."
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,3.76,Maybe a bad batch but the flavors were super muted and didn't pop like a normal trill beer.
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,4.01,"poured a turbid murky orange color - is very reminiscent of OJ. Nose smells of OJ/citrus with a honey sweetness and a mild bitterness on the end. taste follows the nose, sweet citrus, followed by some bitterness but ends with hop burn/resin that remains for a bit - the can was rolled before opening. Feel is viscous and think for an IIPA, but has very good carb. Overall, this smells incredible and initial good taste, but the hop burn overtakes the palate. Maybe the hops need to dye down some - but this can is around a month old at this point. Have two other cans, and will open in increments over the next month. Will update if the taste increase."
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,4.69,Exquisite!
Bleue (Blue),4.4,"Just bought in a bottle from my new local supermarket in Paris, never had before, not sure what to expect...

Bottle looks pretty cheap. Not expecting much...

Dark, deep, lingering foam...more even more beautiful than Guinness.

Aroma is natural, deep and inviting. Though a little too carbon dioxidey (in case you are foreign, that is not a word, I just created it...)

Very flavoursome, smooth and highly drinkable, for 9%. Reminds me of Christmas, even though it is August. Bitter, citrussy, loving it. Most stouts and dark beers are much too choclatey and heavy...this is still light, despite the high alcohol content. Definitely going to be drinking more of this. Unfortunately not tonight as my supermarket closes in 8 minutes and I live on the 7th floor with no lift, typical hardcore parisian style.

In Paris I remember I went to a bar opposite my apartment, ordered one of these...drank it in about 5 minutes...ordered another and drank it in 5 minutes. And then ordered another. The bitch French (Senegalese) bar maid told me that I had already had 2 and that now I can only have water. WTF!? So I went to a different bar. In England you could order 10 in 1 hour and they would love you for it.

Very good feel, it really zings in your mouth and the bubbles themselves have flavour. But not as amazing feel as some West Coast IPA's from America. However because of the smoothness and high alcohol content...and I guess premium ingredients...the high from drinking a few of these is amazing. Dark beers always keep you in control, unlike lagers, pilsners and IPA's. I have no idea why this is, maybe it's chromatics.

This beer is pretty cheap in Paris, and the best I have had so far that they sell locally. Will have to be careful as it probably will not mix too well with my current 7th floor no lift parisian style.

I would add that this beer is variable in my experience...

Although for me many West Coast IPA's are better than this overall, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would probably choose this one."
Bleue (Blue),4.31,"I'm reviewing a bottle from 2021. At the sight it shows a dark brown color. As soon as it is poured into the glass, a very compact and balanced foam is formed. The nose is not particularly articulated, perhaps notes of cherry and spices as well as a strong hint of alcohol stand out.
At the first sip all the sweet character of banana and chocolate comes out, which was a little covered on the nose and now is released. Overall, I was particularly struck by the strong and balanced flavor of this beer that I would approach very well with a tasting of cured meats and cheeses.
Overall rating 4.5."
Bleue (Blue),5,Perfect beer for any occasion!
Bleue (Blue),4.86,"look. mahogany black tea walnut wood stain garnet moss
smell. spicey bubblegummy honey black treacle rose gardens
taste. almond pistachio amaretto velvet booze soaked bread pudding
feel. full bodied and bright
overall. absolutely brilliant, a work of art. unfortunately, it was served at lager temperature. as it warms up though, there's a delicious blood dough candy flavor that emerges from it's cacoon."
Bleue (Blue),4.7,First beer that got my attention. A bomb of spice and fruity sweetness. Doesn't get much better than this
Bleue (Blue),4.75,Its quite pricey and you wouldn't want to have a habit of drinking these daily but when you can it sure is a nice beer. Heavy on the IBU and the Belgium flavors two of my favorite things.
Bleue (Blue),4.19,"L: Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a 16 ounce glass. Beep brown with a thick 4 finger head. Lots of soapy lacing on the glass as it's emptied.

S: Aroma of alcohol, yeast and fresh bread.

T: Candied fruit, toffee, dark stone fruit.

F: Smooth, like velvet, with a slight alcohol burn. Full bodied, and strong.

O: A marvelous, and timeless classic. I need to get more and age it. It rank it with Trappiste Rochfort 10 and Samichlaus Classic. Top tier."
Bleue (Blue),4.37,"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Half finger tan head. Dark cola color. Minor lacing. Some alcohol legs.

S - Malty and boozy. Some dark fruits like an after dinner wine. Sweetness in there as well.

T - Sweet with some spices in there. The spices were unexpected, but a great extra taste. Bready / Biscuity Malt. No bitterness. Some booziness, but not over-alcohol tasting at 9% ABV. Each taste changes a bit. Keeps you coming back for more.

F - Good carbonation. Medium thickness on mouthfeel. Almost creamy with agitation to bring back the head.

O - I really like this. Drank it at the beginning of Spring, but would be a great Winter / Fall beer. I loved the surprising sweet and spicy taste. Will definitely add this to the annual rotation."
Bleue (Blue),4.37,"On draft at Iron Abby, Horsham PA. What a wonderful beer. Dark color with nice white head. I taste plums, raisins and caramel. Finishes so smooth."
Bleue (Blue),4.77,This beer is a beautiful thing - a beautiful large head sitting atop a rich dark ale . With such a strong alcohol content it will certainly knock you out a bit but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Great fruity and caramel flavours - you can taste the history here. Not an every day drink but certainly good for a colder day of the week - especially if you have one of the wide Chimay glasses at home..
Bleue (Blue),4.56,"Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a slightly off white head that slowly grows to be over five inches thick. Over the course of a few minutes it slowly recedes to a creamy looking millimetre cap on top. Lovely looking beer.

I honestly thought I smelled aromas before I unbottled it. Lots of the typical notes are here, doughy and yeasty malt flavours, backed by a general sweetness and mild booziness, rum raisin cake, a deliciously deep and sweet savoury note, maybe dark chocolate covered dried dark fruits? Spices abound, hard to pick them apart, but you can always expect cloves and just a hint of liquorice. It’s really something else

The taste? It absolutely follows the nose, but the way it does it is what makes this such an experience to drink. Aside from what you get on the aromas, I’ll point out the most notable flavours. Bubbly, creamy, and boozy up front. You get hints of rum soaked, moist raisin cake. Spices hit you soon after and meld seamlessly, cloves nutmeg and liquorice are notable here. Deliciously yeasty and toasty caramel malts can be tasted throughout the sip and become quite notable at the end, augmented by the spices and sweetness, sort of tastes like you just had toasted bread with butter and cinnamon. Some dark cherry notes here and caramelized banana. Likely due to the high abv% mixing with the fruity esters and the caramel malt flavour, but it makes for some unique and tasty flavours. Perhaps just the slightest hint of general hop bitterness throughout.

Long and complex finish, which is mostly dry and fairly sweet. I didn’t pick up much bitterness myself. More lively carbonation than you might expect, but the carbonation is quite fine. Creates a creamy sip on the way down and prickles at your tongue. ABV% is slightly more noticeable than some other high alcohol beers, but it’s still masked well and the way you feel it with the flavours/it adds to your taste perception is a plus, honestly.

Phenomenal beer, honestly. Mine was a few months old, would love to try an aged one. I think it helped bring the effervescence down slightly judging by how carbonated some other reviewers said theirs were. I only have one more in my cellar, and this is a beer I would love to try at all life stages. Super fresh, a few months old, year or two old, and a super old cellared grandpa! Or maybe it’s just indicative that I want to drink a lot of this. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves any Belgian, or European beers. Or honestly, anyone who likes beers at all. It’s a must try!"
Bleue (Blue),4.56,"Received this cellared version in a trade with @Providence - Date code is L11-545 So bottled in 2011? No idea, but he said it was old.
Poured rather darker than expected for an Ale; almost cola brown. The manila colored head lasted a very brief time before retreating just to the circumference of the glass.
The aroma was potent! Lots of dark fruit (Think figs and/or prunes) and a surprising amount of spice - almost akin to a Christmas ale - curious as I wasn't expecting that at all.
The flavor follows, the malts lead the party but the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg?) want to play too. It may be my imagination but it seems they didn't want to get along. Didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it anyway.
The feel was better than expected if this is indeed an 11 year old bottle. I would not have guessed that at all; but now I kick myself for not grabbing a fresher one for a side by side.
Really good beer, but then, that seems to be the consensus."
Bleue (Blue),4.6,"This one is prototypical of the style for me, a classic for good reason. I've had it many times, but not recently, and never reviewed til now.
Bottled 2021, date/batch code L21-561.
Strong aromas and flavors of deep caramel, spiced figs, cherries and roast malts. Lively carbonation and bright yeast esters, good sweetness at the front with a dry finish.
Outstanding beer."
Bleue (Blue),4.47,This is a little too much flavor for me. I can’t drink ad much as I can Chimay Red.
Bleue (Blue),4.25,"Pour is a light cola colored, but once in the glass it's a much deeper, darker brown. While the pour was fairly aggressive, there was more head than I anticipated, although it only last a couple minutes before receding to a thin spotty cap. Aroma is loads of rich malts, caramel & figs. Taste more or less follows the nose, with some bready notes joining the party. Well balanced, deceptively complex, and super easy drinking in a way that belies its ABV. Very good."
Bleue (Blue),3.37,"Look...blackish with a dark brown overtone. off whitish beige head with ample carbonation
Smell...light hint of citrus and hops. Soft smell of malt
Taste...Sweet malt with dark fruit , taste of sugar. banana and yeast.
Feel...Definitely a lightness not expected and light lacing presence on the beer.
Overall...a decent beer just not my cup of tea. Don't get the excitement of this style so my score definitely reflects that. i am glad it was a gift because the price on these suckers are exorbitant."
Old Rasputin,4.38,I got lucky. On the way home from disc golf league stopped at an cou country bumpkin gas station that has some decent beer there was a whole whole stack of this so apparently someone's drinking it I grabbed four cuz I really wanted a nice Stout a little worried it would be just too much but it's pleasant surprise not too high ABV for Russians not too sweet leaned a little hoppy cuz I think it's fresh somehow in this country bumpkin gas station store it wasn't old stuff good stout bordering on just a heavy Stout rather than a Russian this one's very well done and normally I'm afraid to go this high on the ABV but this is so heavy you don't notice it as badly there is a heavy cocoa bitter coffee hop that bounces back between those variables can't tell which one it is it keeps you guessing that's probably why it has a cult following
Old Rasputin,4.4,"Jet black appearance with an average size tan head that left good lacing. Compelling aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit and molasses. Rich flavors with layers of chicory, bittersweet chocolate, ripe dark fruit amid the roasted malts while the hops stay supportive and add balance. Earthy, full bodied, modestly carbonated mouthfeel leading to a long lasting finish."
Old Rasputin,3.8,"Appearance: Pours A smoky jet black with a thick tan head.
Smell: Smells of coffee, dark chocolate and pumpernickel bread.
Taste: The brew blasts you with intense dark baking chocolate, with a hint of coffee and very faint sweetness. The Dark bitter chocolate dominates every other flavor.
Mouthfeel: Big and creamy.
This is a good beer,"
Old Rasputin,5,"I am impressed with this beer in every aspect. As most stouts are, this one has all the characteristics of dark chocolate and roasted special grains with the hops sitting behind it all to mediate and balance the blend. Being that high ABV beers are tricky to brew, covering the alcohol flavor with success takes trial and error. Absolutely one of my top favorites in the stout realm along side Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and Deschutes Obsidian Stout."
Old Rasputin,4.9,Almost as good as Founders Breakfast Stout.
Old Rasputin,4.55,"Rasputin has never let me down. (knock on wood) Sometimes it is quite hoppy and other times it is more stouty and malty, but it is never disappointing. A good experience at a good price."
Old Rasputin,4.46,"L- Pitch black.

S- Dark roasted malt aroma.

T- Dark chocolate flavor with a very slight
sweetness. Slightly bitter.

F- Moderately viscous mouthfeel with
very fine carbonation.

O- A fantastic Russian Imperial Stout!"
Old Rasputin,5,One of my top 5 favorite beers.
Old Rasputin,4.96,"Dark chocolate colored with good head. Smells of cocoa, chocolate, malt and strong stout. Tastes of a rich stout flavored mild cocoa malt and hint of bitterness and sweetness. A very good beer strong but not overpowering. Well done and strong to the finish! Wow!"
Old Rasputin,5,"COLOR:

Jet black, with a hefty mocha colored head that's about 2-3 fingers and lingers. This beer is as black as the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.

AROMA:

Smoked malt, molasses, figs, leather, cocoa, brown sugar, with a hint of hops.

Smells quite lovely.

BODY AND PALATE:

Tastes like it smells. Rich smoked malt that comes across as espresso and dark chocolate. A lot of the other notes show up, with a nice hops bitter note that doesn't overpower the rich bittersweetness of this stout.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's heavy mkay? Nice and creamy feeling, which is what I prefer in a stout or a porter.

FINISH:

This one coats the tongue and lingers. It develops oh so well, and lands on a curious whole wheat toast finish, which I guess I'm attributing to the malt, which is interesting and welcome. I love malty aftertastes.

CONCLUSION:

This is the gold standard of imperial stouts. It hits all of the notes, and ticks all of the boxes as to what I expect out of a nice stout. Every stout I try is compared to this, and most, unless they're milk stouts, fail to compare.

Black as sin? Check.

Rich as coffee in flavor? Check.

Thick and full bodied? Check.

Rich and complex without one note overpowering the other? Check.

Easy sipper? Oh HELL YES!!!!

Smacks you in the face with how strong it is? You betcha.

Only issue is the slight bloated feeling I get drinking imperial stouts. They're basically meals in a glass, so if you want a refreshing beer, might wanna look elsewhere. That said, this pairs really well with waffles, surprisingly.

Overall, for me, this is a 10/10 beer. It is my favorite beer of all time, and all stouts I compare to this, which I suppose now is an unfair comparison."
Old Rasputin,4.5,"L: jet black inky body, nice light head. Standard quality stout.

S: roasty, smoky, a hint of salted caramel, and ethyl. Weaker on the nose than I’d like but it’s good.

T: Follows nose. It definitely helps to open it up a bit and let it warm. Reminds me of fall without the spices.

F: a little oily but not much. Coats the tongue a little and has mild carbonation. Not perfect, but rewarding.

O: I can’t wait to revisit this once the weather starts cooling off. A quality benchmark stout to measure all stouts against. Not my favorite stout, but definitely a classic."
Old Rasputin,4.13,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for 5-10 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: dark molasses, with cola highlights. Had to pour in stages, due to the 4-finger thick, dense, dark tan head

Smell: oats, dark chocolate, malts, and dark dried fruits

Taste: intense, dark roast coffee on the front end, with some slight lightening to a bit herbaceousness in the middle. Lingering notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate notes emerge in the middle as the beer continues to air and warm

Mouthfeel: full at the front, giving way to a syrupy smooth feel in the mouth. Good effervescence on the tongue, preventing it from becoming overwhelmingly heavy.

Overall: hot damn, this is a tantalizing beer. On look and smell alone, it gets near perfect marks. Taste was a tad bit too bitter for my palate, but it still had diverse elements to the bitterness that made it enjoyable. I can see why it's consistently ranked one of the best beers, if not the best stout"
Old Rasputin,4.39,"L-tan thick head that’s long lasting
S-malts, coffee
T-a surprisingly unified flavor, in that the aftertaste matches the beginning. Multiple flavors but none predominate and I’m hard pressed to call out, e.g., coffee, chocolate, or dark fruits in particular.
F-an amazingly creamy, full bodied mouth feel that completely hides the abv
O-an outstanding and enjoyably flavored stout that’s most distinguished in my books for its mouthfeel which makes it remarkably enjoyable."
Old Rasputin,4.03,"Bought a 4-Pack, poured one in a pilsner glass

Dark brown body, 1 1/2 finger beige cream lacy head, with a roasty and aromatic of milk chocolate. It has a powerful warming flavor, creamy on the tongue and then bitterness and abv profile arrives on the palate backed by a dry hostile takeover by the complex flavors that remains.

One bottle is going into the cellar to see how it fairs after a year or so!"
Old Rasputin,4.13,The beer that taught me to appreciate stouts. Best consumed slow and with snacks.
Old Rasputin,4.29,"On tap in a big snifter glass.

Black as can be color. The 2F cap looks like tan colored heavy cream, incredible retention. Lacing clings to the glass like glue.

Aromas come in mild; smoked roasted malt, toffee, and English hops.

Roasted malt, sugary chocolate coffee flavors.

Creamy and full bodied RIS with a hop kicking finish.

Exactly like an English brew should be, all good without going overboard."
Old Rasputin,5,My favorite Stout. Outstanding!
Old Rasputin,4.72,Black as used motor oil. Thick consistency. Strong coffee notes. Flavor is a bold smoky bitter dark chocolate. Overall one of my favorite beers.
Old Rasputin,4.33,"L: poured from a 22 can into a glass mug, nice 3+ fingers of head that took at least 3 minutes to dissipate. Rocky top and light espresso crema in color. Big clumps of lacing till the very end. Pitch black in color.

S: dark chocolate heavy, a little more hops than I was expecting. Not the best glass, but really didn’t get that much even after the beer warmed up.

T: so much better than the smell. Loads of dark chocolate and some smoke with a nice hop bitterness. Root beer, cola, and molasses that flows into light notes of peppermint patty.

F: maybe a little thinner than some other stouts that I have had, but I prefer it that way. Coats the front snide of the mouth with a nice creamy feel. Warming"
Old Rasputin,2.73,"I'm really surprised by the reviews for this one compared to my own experience. Usually BeerAdvocate doesn't steer me wrong. And this beer isn't ""wrong,"" it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.

L: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood.

S: ""Generic beer"". I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...

T&F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No ""smoke"" as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.

O: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again. And judging it as a stout, it fails in many of the characteristics you'd expect."
Old Rasputin,4.5,"my 2nd try with this popular stout... before found it a bit too hoppy-malty bitter to my liking. but now... acquiring the taste a bit.

The bottling code begins with the numerals ""11"" so i assume this is the year it was sealed? Pours an opaque raven with a bubbly cocoa head, dissipated to a mist & menacing gauntlet of bubbles on the surface. Fantastic webbing that stays put! Aroma is like a pumpernickel bread with molasses... Taste is slightly sweet, but largely dry and deeply bitter from the hops & roasted malts... something minty overhead that reminds me of a peppermint patty?... Swallow is deep, bittersweet, nice body and not too sticky, coats the tongue.

an RIS most worthy of its reputation."
Hop Rod Rye,4.19,"Bottle poured into a Bear Republic Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Toasty bready malt, rye spice, earthy, herbal, pine, floral notes, light citrus, faint hints of dark fruit, and a little toffee sweetness.

T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness.

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er.

O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!"
Hop Rod Rye,4.11,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.

A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.

S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast.

T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot.

M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.

O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie."
Hop Rod Rye,4.15,"Pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.

Smells of malt and caramel.

Tastes of toasted semi sweet spicy malt with a slightly bitter, alcohol warm finish.

Medium body and carbonation. Lush smooth mouthfeel.

This is an excellent old-school West Coast IPA."
Hop Rod Rye,4.4,"From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice."
Hop Rod Rye,3.96,"A really smooth, pleasant quaff. The rye gives it a spicy complexity, but it retains the fruitiness and herbal qualities of a nice brown ale. Biterness is well-balanced, making it easy to drink. Nice, silky mouth feel. Overall, a fun little beer and a nice effort for Bear Republic."
Hop Rod Rye,4.27,"Where's this beer been hiding? I love it. Found in bomber in bodega in SF for night cap.
a) Pours a dense 1 finger cap in the smallest glass and HOLDS IT, Lasts, laces, rocks it over a hazed ice tea body.
s) IPA made more bitter, more astringent by rye. But too faint.
t) Taste is abundant. Brings intense bittering, balanced by grainy sweet, whiskey like but hiding ABV well, then cascade of hop citrus, pine, grass, earthy floor, and dank flavors. Some mollasses, dark toasted grain, long finish, with pepper, muskiness, earthiness.
f) Creamy, great mouth feel, luscious. Matches the whiskey, creamy head look.
o) Overall favorite rye (18%!) beer."
Hop Rod Rye,3.91,"Draft at Rohnert Park location. Dark amber with creamy head, curtains of lacing. Malty aroma, some funky hops. Taste brings in the rye, dark bread flavors, more of the hops, and leaves with a nice lasting tingling on the tongue. Flavorful."
Hop Rod Rye,4.5,Yup. Very tasty stuff right here!
Hop Rod Rye,4.94,"This is a momument. A hybrid of barley and roasted rye. Wlildly hoppy, pleasurably cloudy and bitter.
Eminently complex, it takes American IPAs to the pinacles of perfection.
I can't get enough of it. But lo! this one is strong. So BEWARE! and enjoy."
Hop Rod Rye,4.35,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Speiglau IPA glass.

Really dark amber color with a thin white head.

Aroma is lots of spicy rye and sweet malt.

Taste is a wonderful balance of spicy rye, hops and malt."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4.5,"This review will only be limited to the category of American Adjunct Lager. With that said we can skip the looks smell and feel because it doesnt matter when it comes to this. Pabst is probably my favorite of all the commercial beers with Miller Highlife right behind it. Never have understood why so many people insist on drinking Bud Light and it's the worst we'll,. I take that back. Natural Light is the worst beer in history but it is the same company. Anybody remember when Bud Dry was introduced? I have a suspicion that they accidently fermented all the sugars out of a batch making it dry as in 0 on a hydrometer. They tried to sell what they could but nobody liked it. The commercial said ""Why Ask Why?"". ""Drink Bud Dry"". Anyway, Pabst is pretty good with lime and salt but always make sure it is as cold as ice without freezing. It's the best of the shit beers so to say."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3,"This definitely wasn't as bad as some like to say, which is usually the case with macro beers. But there was an odd... idk what to call it but it wasn't a normal beer flavor. Definitely not a favorite but not undrinkable"
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3,"One of those beers from back in the day when I was in the service and when I was in college. When the money was tight, we could always afford it because we paid about 4 or 5 dollars for a 12 pack. I'll drink it anytime it's offered."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.96,"I mean, it’s PBR. It’s for high school kids who think they are nerdier and more discriminating than the jocks who drink natty light. It doesn’t taste good at all. Like piss in a can."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.52,"Yeah, my grandfather used to drink this stuff by the flat. Its a good one. It sits just above Genesse and the like in my opinion. I typically drink higher end IPAs and stouts but I grabbed a six pack of this on an impulse. I don't mind it. I would drink it mowing the lawn or digging a trench during the summer heat. Better than Coors by a mile. Better than MGD by a mile. Not heavy carbonated or heavy ABV so it goes well with the summer heat. Thick white head that clings to the glass and fizzles out after a few minutes. Colored light yellow like straw. Don't listen to the haters. It's not bad."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.85,"You're outside with a submarine sandwich from the deli. The air outside is fresh, the sky is blue, the world around you is alive. Don't drink PBR in any other circumstance."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.7,"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass

On the pour a 2 finger head forms which reduces relatively slowly for the style to ring around the rim and a covering of fine bubbles over the whole beer. Body is light gold a bit darker than bmc beers, but very similar. Relatively lazy carbonation for the style, and crystal clear.

Aroma is very light, but it seems like a good thing as there isn't a lot of malt or anything else going on. Some adjunct sweetness and generic lager aroma but nothing fantastic or notable. Possibly vaguely corny and chemically as well, but not disgusting.

Flavor follows the aroma with adjunct sweetness followed by some vague malts and corniness. The flavor then goes into its yeasty flavors which is dominated by a dry generic lager flavor with a bit of diacetyl thrown in for fun it seems. Not much is really off, but there is so little malt flavor that's all that really comes through.

Feel is not the best for the style either, head doesn't really return to give a creamy feel but rather has mostly carbonation bite leaving the beer feeling rather dense. Still light compared to other styles but the feel was all that was really left for this beer to redeem itself.

Overall it's boring with just enough off and no real redeeming qualities to make it one that I'm not going to come back to. No malt flavors and the adjunct ""maltbill"" is so obvious that it's not even funny. Feels like corn soda almost."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.6,"I believe I had it first whilst plastered @ a bar. But recent, I had it while working on some yard work on a very warm date. Hence this review, the beer smells great. The beer tastes great. It is a nice full bodied beer. I am still a novice @ the intricacies of reviewing a beer. But just know that this beer is good, got me drunk after 3 (16 oz) Don't let the stats fool yeah, it might be low ABV but was brewed with such care that it packs an unbeknownst punch. Don't just take my word, drink it yourself and tell us how it makes you feel."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.44,"On the higher end of its class, a refreshing enough warm weather lager with a bit more grainy flavor than most others."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.33,This is a great beer for the cost. Borderline disgusting but also helps out the wallet. pretty good overall score from me.
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),4,Really tired of craft beer snob betas giving this beer a low score. This beer is the best of the American Adjunct. It is less bubblegummy than Budweiser and less Sickeningly malty than High life. It’s dry corn flavor with great hop forwardness is what its all about (good luck finding hop flavor at all in Bud or Miller). Get off your hipster high horse and stop giving this beer a bandwagon bad rating. This is a good beer and you know it.
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.4,"The problem with PBR is it tastes passable if weak. So it's easy to drink, but by the time you've gone through one or two tall boys your short-term responsible drinking allotment is done and all you've drank is more or less nothing in the flavor category.
A flat out bad beer you can't drink and just give up on. With PBR you keep trying and by the time you figure out it's a road to nowhere it's too late. Which makes it the beer I hate most in the world. My advice is to limit to 1 12 oz serving or dump those 4 last ounces from the tall boy on principle. Probably was better before megacorp X bought it."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.09,"2 for $3 tallboys... It's not great beer but it's not at all bad. It's not watery and it doesn't taste like urine, so it avoids the usual failings. Pleasant bready taste, nothing more nothing less. Again: 2 for $3 tallboys"
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.11,"Cost cheap, taste cheap. Too acidic. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd drink in a pinch and not complain."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.61,"Look: Looks like cheap beer. Decent enough head, not much lacing.

Smell: Smells like beer.

Taste: Tastes like beer. Lots of grain, a little hop action.

Feel: Clean, uncomplicated, accessible.

Overall: It's cheap and tastes like beer. 30-rack for less than an hour's wages. A day-drinking classic that will never go out of style."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),1.99,Tastes like soaking wonderbread in carbonated water
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),2.4,"Not great, not even good. If I hadn’t paid $3.25 during happy hour, I wouldn’t have finished it. Hints of lighter fluid."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),3.11,"Used to sneak these from my Dad as a youngster back in the 70's. It was ""old man's"" beer back then. The hip crowd was into Michelob. Funny how things change. I still enjoy Pabst now and then."
Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),5,"A light crushable beer, no bells or whistles just quality"
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,4.98,Refreshingly flavored. Love the color. Been a favorite for 20 years. The carbonation stands out and actually quenches the thirst perfectly!
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.8,"Pours a golden straw color with over a finger of head. The nose is straight-up maraschino cherries. The flavor has sweet cherry notes as well. The body is spot on.

To his makes for an enjoyable spring/summer session brew."
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.65,"American Wheat Tulip
Look: Clear gold color. Pouring a 1 finger head which dissipated into a ring with lacing
Smell: Maraschino cherry syrup, toasted wheat, almond
Taste: Tart cherry, light hop bitterness, honey sweetness, wheat and malt. Finish comprises of cherry and toasted malt
Feel: Moderate carbonation, light mouthfeel, semi-crisp
Overall: Its a alright wheat beer, wish there was more honey and cherry flavor but you can tell they are there atleast"
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3,Meh…very articficial tasting. Not good but not terrible.
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,2.63,"L - Poured from a bottle into a glass. Pale and cloudy. No head.

S - Smells sweet with cherry flavor. Exactly what I’d expect from the label

T - Tastes like they added cherries to a wheat beer. Exactly what the label indicates, but the beer flavor and cherry flavor do not mix at all.

F - Has good carbonation.

O - Overall, I didn’t like this beer. It’s literally like taking a wheat beer and adding cherries and/or cherry flavoring. It doesn’t work for me. Maybe if you love cherries you’d like this, but for that kind of cherry flavoring, you’re better off with a flavored hard lemonade or something. Did not finish. Not recommended."
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.72,Oddly enough I happened to really like this one. Cherry flavor is very evident and I do like it. I see a lot of people find this a polarizing offering. I like it idk
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.5,Heavy cherry taste and scent to the point it can be overbearing if you don't like fruity beers.
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,1.32,Tastes like cherry cough syrup. I don't know how you get real cherries to taste this bad. Waste of grain and money.
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,2.94,"Best by 3/2022

You know, as stupid as it may sound, this was one of the first beers I searched for when I began drinking underage. Me and my friends lusted after it but were never able to secure it. Flash forward years later, and I find singles of it at my local store. For the hell of it, I picked one up just to see for myself what I was missing years ago (probably not much)

Pours a cloudy gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh man, the cherry here is super artificial in the nose, very candy-like. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry jolly rancher, lime juice, crackery malt, earthy wheat, and light honey

While the aroma was definitely candy forward, it also promised a fruity tartness. The taste is a huge letdown in the wake of this, not very good at all. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, cracker, sweet honey, and lemon rind. The swallow takes a nose dive in quality, bringing notes of cherry cough syrup, doughy malt, earthy wheat, and sticky seeet honey

A promising start of a light body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a refreshing beer. But it finishes sad and sticky, just way too sweet

Ok so it’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s pretty amusing to see what younger me was missing. Not worth repeating"
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.59,honestly pretty shocked how much i enjoyed this one it would pair well with a christmas dinner or thanksgiving
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.2,"this is a okay beer not bad it is a basic wheat beer taste cherry not a lot and some light beer flavors
Still drinkable"
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.5,Decent cherry smell. Very light carbonation and light colour. Very Cherry taste with a honey after taste
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.68,"Mostly pale in color, was definitely expecting a hue more representative of a cherry. Lots of cherry on the nose, more artificial though, really similar to a cherry 7up. Taste followed the nose with a hint of a wheat backbone. Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Not terrible, but nothing groundbreaking. Decent overall."
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.63,"With a bright golden complexion and refreshing appearance, the Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is wonderful summertime option. I took this along on a midmorning hike over Labor Day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed this sweet and light beer in the woods. Immediately, your nose is hit with cherry, fruity and bread like aromas. Following into a sip and a pleasant candy-like cherry flavor plays with you taste buds. There is an almost dry finish to it and at the end you're not really itching for another. A sweet fun change up, but once in awhile. Not really a go to for me, but enjoyed the experience."
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden color with a soft white head. SRM of 7. (3.50)

Aroma: Strong and intense aromas of sweet cherry upfront. There's sweet and candied cherry and faint syrup. Some bread, cream, and hints of vanilla through the end. (3.50)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more candied cherry. This is followed by a bready and soft wheat malt. Finishes creamy to clean off the cherry sweetness. (3.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to stronger carbonation. Finishes soft and clean on the palate. (4.00)

Compared to Castle Danger's Castle Cream Ale 5/27/21: Pours a more golden color. Stronger aromas/flavors. Much more cherry obviously. Less cream and malt liquor flavor.

Overall: I wasn't sure what to expect of this one because some said the cherry was mild, while others found it overpowering. Whoever said the cherry was overpowering was right. The cherry is strong here. Lots of candied cherry. Smells like a cherry Blow-Pop and tastes sort of like cherry pie. (Final Rating: 3.50)"
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,3.68,Wheat and cherries on the nose. Taste follows suit with bread and malt coming first and cherries on the backend. Has a nice malty feel to it that adds a lot to my enjoyment of it. Good beer.
Ten FIDY,3.1,"Reviewed near blind... all I know whilst making these notes is it's American and high ABV%.
L- Pours jet black, with an impressive 3Cm notably very dark tan head. The head lingers for 10mins (as I was then distracted), now down to about 3mm + heavy lacing which is a heck of an achievement for this ABV% of beer where the surface-tension usually zaps the head super quickly.
S- Whiskey, treacle + timber barrel.
T- Molasses/black treacle, super deeply intense/pungent, notable whiskey, then up it comes a solid ABV% zing - bam!
F- Rich but not outright sweet. It's super-pungently flavoured, so much so it's a reeeal slow-sipping beer, just waaay too intense to sup as usual. Be aware if drinking on a hot night that the beer might materially warm in the glass before you can enjoy it all.
O- I'm often in a quandry to know how to rate beers like this. No doubt it's BIG, but subtlety and balance are harder to achieve IME and a nobler achievement, and a high ABV% CAN achieve that. It has a *very* shouty ABV%; and 12.5% isn't even that high (try visiting Iceland for properly high ABV% beer hehe) ... usually not considered good brewing if the ABV% is whacking your palate, albeit from a liquor barrel aged beer. Would I drink it again, no thanks it's way too big a shouty statement; I've had far higher ABV% beers than this that have achieved subtlety and balance.
355ml can. BB: 11/11/2025 Bought from Bacchanalia, Mill Road, Cambridge/UK £7.69"
Ten FIDY,4.2,"L - Poured from a can into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. Huge frothy two and a half finger chocolate head on aggressive pour. Lots of lacing. Dark opaque color

S - Scent was a chocolate, malt, roast, and caramel. So many great smell. Sweet. A little boozy.

T - Taste follows scent. Dark Chocolate and bitter chocolate. Roasty. Sweetness in there as well. Some dark fruits as you drink. Toward the end, the coffee notes are more present, which I don't prefer.

F - Great carbonation and frothiness. Enjoyable mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a great beer, but as with other beers with coffee flavors, I’m not a fan, since I don’t like coffee. Despite that fact, this was still a good beer for me. I’m glad I tried it, and I would definitely recommend it to any coffee fans."
Ten FIDY,4.27,"Look: Jet black on the pour and in the glass and even my delicate pour prompts a huge light brown head to explode and pillow up, eventually relenting some and leaving awesome lacing behind
Aroma: Roast, dark chocolate, ethanol, roasted barley, bready notes, earthy hops, and blackstrap molasses
Taste: Brown bread, baking cocoa, and roast jump out and tailed by wafts of alcohol heat which all hold for a second before earthy and slightly spicy hops come out to play. A little molasses and light brown sugar wafts are noticed in the background and closes with roast, chocolate, and booze along with a big bite
Mouthfeel: Full, somewhat silky, medium-high carbonation, and a very dry and robust finish
Overall: I dig it. This beer is big and means business and you can tell both of those things right away. I hadn’t had this in years and it was like I remembered in that it’s a hoppy and big Imperial Stout that flexes its muscle throughout and is a well-made and good one as well. A must-try for Imperial Stout/Russian Imperial Stout fans and I’m glad that its cold outside as this one is definitely a belly warmer."
Ten FIDY,4.5,Pours dark brown and opaque with a very light foam. The smell is of bourbon and coffee.
Ten FIDY,4.29,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack. Canned 9/25/21, so this beer is almost 4 months old. I had this in the fridge and allowed it to come up to room temperature before I cracked it open.

Look: Pours out a very dark almost black color. There was a thick, rocky brown/dark tan colored head that slowly reduced to a thin layer, leaving behind some nice looking lacing.

Smell: Smells nice. Intense dark chocolate, coffee, sweet notes of marzipan and vanilla and some booze. There are also secondary notes of dark fruits. It has a nice roasty aroma.

Taste: Interesting. Up front, it is very dark and roasty and there are also some sweet pastry type notes (think brownies and chocolate cake). The finish lingers long and is more bitter than I expected - lots of roasted malt and there is a strong charcoal flavor on the finish. I think that there is a lot of bitterness and some oiliness from hops that is coming out in the finish. This beer definitely does not taste like it's 10.5% ABV, although I do get some warming in my chest as I consume more of it.

Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a very interesting finish. I would say that it is a bit thin for what I was hoping for.

Overall: I haven't had this beer in years. My old roommate and I used to split cases of this beer. It's definitely one of the quintessential American imperial stouts, and its availability has stood the test of time. I guess that my main criticism is that it doesn't taste as complex as some other great imperial stouts that I have had. Perhaps it would benefit from aging?"
Ten FIDY,4.53,"Very beautiful stout. Slow rising, dark head. Notes of roasted espresso in the nose. Taste is candy caramel with coffee and chocolate. Very very bitter yet delicious and drinkable."
Ten FIDY,4.43,"Scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack purchased at Super One Liquor in Duluth, MN.
An incredibly firm and deep stout. It is boozy, firm tannins, very dark with a dark tan head, roasty toasty, dark bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a lot of staying power on the palate and is staining. It's great flavors are bold and powerful overall and is quite excellent tasting. Amazing beer in a can."
Ten FIDY,3.04,"Guess I'm too stoned or something lmao, I've had a solid share of imperial stouts now and this sucks to me. I taste sweet booze and nothing else. Maybe it's somehow still cold but I'll stick to breakfast stout, KBS, Expedition, Narwhal, idk dude this is somehow one of the worst I've had."
Ten FIDY,4.77,"One sip propelled this Imperial Stout into my top 3! I didn’t have to evaluate it. That’s a good sign. Seeing how dark it was, I expected it to be thick-n-chewy, sweet, and have a lot of alcohol burn.
Holy shit!…It had more balance than an olympic gymnast and an exceptional roasted malt complexity which carried throughout the finish. I avoid canned beer at all costs, but I really wanted to try this one so I took a chance on it. Poured into a stout glass and cooled just long enough, I indulged. I expected the typical regret of a curiosity purchase, but instead I was thrilled at the discovery of a new favorite! Although I was amused by the name of this beer, it actually detracts from this seriously well crafted Imperial Stout."
Ten FIDY,4.4,"don't know what i think about 97 but ok it's a very strong offering. Happy to put it in the rotation
L: from the can. minimalist but v stylish
S; nice. malt, molasses, coffee, stone fruit. very inviting.
T: delivers nicely on the nose. complex flavors and a hoppy bitterness on the close. Thank you sir, may I have another!
F: rich and smooth. Yeah, baby.
O: I like it, man. Not a 97 but am I giving it a 96? Whatever. Go for it."
Ten FIDY,4.49,"1800th review!

Appearance - Pours a dark jet black with two fingers of frothy mocha tan head.

Smell - earthy, leafy, and floral hops, coffee bean, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin and fig), cocoa, and earthy yeast.

Taste - earthy, leafy, and floral hops upfront. Then quickly goes into the bold coffee bean, cocoa, roasted malts, and dark fruits (raisin and fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes velvety smooth with the bold coffee bean and cocoa with a nice lingering alcohol warmth.

Overall - A stellar imperial stout that has been on my radar for quite some time. If you come across this don't leave your local liquor store without a can or two. A pleasant sipper."
Ten FIDY,4.47,"This shouldn't take more than a twelve ounce can poured out and into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. It's expresso black-brown with a tidy tan head that is lasting. There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes. The ABV is high and somewhat noticeable, so that may also put off some. Overall, this is an obviously great example of brewing craftsmanship. But when you go this boldly, not all will follow."
Ten FIDY,4.7,"Pours opaque jet black with a thin but persistent tan rim.

Heady nose of malt, molasses, pumpernickel and black figs.

Palate is massive. First taste is a big bitter hit.beer swiftly envoloped by roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, with fruity fig and plum notes. Some sweetness but the bitterness lingers right through the long finish.

Very full bodied with minimal carbonation, unctuous mouthfeel, lovely lingering bitterness, lot of warm alchohol. Beautiful savoury beer.

This beer ages really well. Mellows some of the alchohol heat and the flavor marry wonderfully."
Ten FIDY,4.19,Excellent well balanced stout!
Ten FIDY,4.71,"It smells sweet with malts and a lot of bourbon. That's really all that I'm getting.

The taste is like bready bourbon up front and then you get a rich coffee bitterness.  The stout coffee flavor and the sweet woody bourbon complement each other beautifully and provide for a balanced taste.

This beer is full bodied and smooth with just a subtle carbonation that gives it an even thicker feel. The finish is clean with alcohol and coffee.

Overall this one is pretty damn fantastic. So balanced and the mouthfeel is great. I'm giving it a 5.8 out of 6... so good!"
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.46,"Picked up a pint bottle from TW-Greenville, SC 5-23-22 for $3.99. Bottle best by 3-2-23,

Beer poured reddish brown with a very nice white head that has some hang time.

Nose is nice, dark fruit esters dominate.

Taste is a medium malt base that is flavored very nicely with figs and currants from the yeast strain. Finishes with an excellently incorporated noble hop leading to a delightful finish.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.

Overall a wonderful beer and representation of the style!"
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.94,"Pours super dark, with very tight bubbles on the head. Smells of dates and figs with a good deal of simple caramalt, not quite dark and roasted but certainly caramalt. Thereafter is a hint of spice, almost like rye but not quite. Reminds me firmly of Korbinian's malt bill.

Oh wow. This is awesome. Fig upfront, with those classic dried fruit, but there's no real brown sugar there. Those can feel so sweet. There's a hint of almost oxidized character but I mean that in a good way, in the way that aged beer has that kind of flavor about it. Tastes so good. Just beautiful, rounded malt character with spice and some very tidy hoppy elements. Mostly though, it's just so full and decadent but in a drinkable way.

Cheers, Completely earns every ounce of its reputation."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.4,"Bottle code L2281 , which I think translates to 8/16/21

Not quite as legendary as Celebrator, but I’m sure nearly as good, we have the Andechs Doppelbock Dunkel. I hear this one come up into conversation every now and then, so I knew I had to pick up a bottle when I saw it. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a slightly cloudy brownish red with 2 fingers of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose on this one is definitely sweet, but also a bit savory which is a nice touch. I’m picking up on aromas of raisin, sweet molasses, brown sugar, bready malt, toasted grain, light herbal hops, and a touch of dark chocolate

The savory vibe really comes through in taste too which I dig. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel toast, brown sugar, fig, cocoa powder, light black pepper, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, sweet molasses, raisin, cocoa powder, herbal hops, pumpernickel toast, and light vanilla

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky but nicely balanced

This is a damn great beer. Typically something that would be better for the depths of winter, but a cooler spring night like tonight is also a beautiful compliment to this beer"
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.31,"Pours a mahogany brown. It is still crystal clear, beautiful in appearance. I get molasses and well browned crusty bread. Maillard, I get Maillard! Getting molasses, a well browned bread crust, some caramel, some brown sugar. This is terrific."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.43,"500 ml bottle stamped L0961 poured into a tulip glass.

Dark clear walnut hue. One finger tan head with spotty lacing, light surface carbonation.
Strong stone fruit, caramel, ginger aromas.
Sweet prune, raisin, toffee, light roast malt, hop zing.
Creamy mouthfeel with light bitter finish. Good carbonation. No alcohol heat.

Delicious well balanced Bock equal to Celebrator and Augustiner."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.43,"A- 500ml traditional bottle pours into a tulip glass with a deep, dark brown body. A creamy, puffy cap forms on the beer with a light tan hue. Good head retention. Lacing is webs with spottiness as well.

S- Dark fruits with raisin definitely coming on strong above a nice mixture of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, light roast, cocoa, tobacco, spices and buttery bread. A bit of smokiness in there that works well with the sweet spiced raisins.

T- Definitely get some nice sweetness out of the gate with medium candi sugar and toffee vibes coming to mind with strong spiced dark fruit notes with raisin, fig and prune notes. Mostly around the toasted brown spectrum but some light cocoa, roast and smoky vibes. Bread, slight buttery-ness, pumpernickel bread and some bitter hops and spices.

MF- The body is medium and the texture is creamy with some frothyness. The carbonation is at a moderate level. Bittersweet ending with spiciness and caramel lingering.

Personally prefer Celebrator but its certainly impossible to go wrong between this and that. Malty but plenty of depth of flavor and balance throughout. Love the depth of the malts here with the toast, sweets, light roast and hint of smoke/tobacco."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.6,Dark brown like a cola with a thin head that appeared then disappeared. Color of head was tan. Nose is malty and slightly caramel. Taste is also caramel with a slight licorice hint that gives way to a malty molasses flavor. Almost like hoarhound candy my grandmother would give me as a child. Superb Bock beer.
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.73,"Draught from Keg. Dark red color. Aroma of German hops. Taste is malty, sweet, a bit of pumpernickel, and heavenly (thanks to Benedictine monks). Mouth feel creamy, toasty. Maybe the best I've tasted, hard to put Celebrator down a notch, but this one does."
Doppelbock Dunkel,3.77,"L: Ruby brown, mild off white head, mild lacing.
S: Fresh buttered bread, caramel. A little boozy.
T: Follows nose with a bit of red fruit. Booze not noticeable.
F: Light/medium bodied, taste lasts moderately long. Not much carbonation. Just seems too light and refreshing for me. Almost feels more like a summer lager.
O: Very solid and I like what it’s trying to do. For some reason it just didn’t resonate much with me. Definitely worth trying though."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.17,"Dark, red-tinted copper color with ample, soft tan head. I’m not detecting much on the nose, just a slight malty smell. Tastes of yeasty bread, caramel, toasted malts, a hint of bitter hops, fig, raisin, toffee, a hint of cocoa. The distinguishing characteristics are the yeast strain, which is unique and pleasant, and the strong depth of the malt background. The other flavors are restrained but noticeable, combining to make for an extremely well balanced final result. Perhaps a tad sweet to be highly sessionable, yet I could easily imagine drinking a liter or more on a nice day. The feel is medium thick and creamy with excellent carbonation. Overall I understand now why people like dopplebocks. The low quality American versions that I have tried don’t do justice to this very fine libation."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.83,These are commonly referred to as mortar shells because of the size and shape of the bottle by American GIs. I would grab them by the case when they were stocked. The taste is incredible with a robust mouth feel. It sits somewhere between a porter and a stout. I wish we could get them imported to the States. This was my go to when I was stationed in Europe.
Doppelbock Dunkel,5,"Great beer, most favorite dark beer."
Doppelbock Dunkel,3.48,"solid Doppelbock, good depth and above average for style. if you like Doppelbocks, you will like this one. If you don't like darker beers, you probably won't like this one."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.38,"Review 1536

My continuation for the fame. This beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a massive three-fingered head with excellent retention. The light tan head is airy and creamy leaving some lacing on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The lacing on the glass is minimal. The color is SRM 20, dark brown with ruby highlights. The clarity of the beer is clear with a few carbonation bubbles.

Dark roasty malts, smoke, Maillard, toffee, caramel, and some floral. Nosing further, I detect malty sweetness, earthy tobacco, a hint of phenols, and chocolate.

Dark roasty malts, chocolate, coffee, and toffee are what I perceive first. Next, I taste floral esters, phenolic, floral esters, smoke, Maillard, caramel, earthy tobacco, and a smidge of phenols,

The mouthfeel of the beer is creamy and thick.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, low carbonation, and fuller finish.

This beer is stupid good. Neither of the flavors is competing for center stage. Some doppelbocks I have consumed, the smoke, and Maillard are more present than I prefer. This beer is balanced in more ways than one. The flavors are spectacular. I enjoyed this beer and would consume it regularly."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.35,"Clear mahogany with somewhat sparse rising bubbles. 1 1/2 tan head, thick, with good retention. It forms pock marks as it recedes and leaves behind momentary lacing which slides down into the beer.

Rich aroma. Dark fruits and sweet molasses. Raisins and figs. Some toast.

The toasted pumpernickel bread is more up front in the flavor than in the taste. Blending in nicely are the dark fruits and sweet bready malts. The middle and finish are smooth and complex. It tends toward the sweet, but the totality is a sumptious blend of the various flavors. The aftertaste is on the sweet side, but not overly so, and leaves a pleasant coating.

Mouth feel is luxurious and medium-to-substantial.

Overall, this is a full and gorgeous doppelbock. Complex, mellow, and a wonderful interplay of flavors."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.32,"Bottle number: L2660, which I assume is the Julian System to make this beer approximately 7-8 months old. Another new to me beer, which makes this another double dip between this thread and a check off the Beers of Fame list.

Pours a dark amber color, fully translucent clarity particularly when held to light. A large and dense light tan head hangs around for the entirety of the drink. Nice lacing. Beautiful beer. Aroma is a malt bomb. I get notes of sweet bread, caramel, some dark fruits, earthy spicy hops. Taste is big dark fruits up front, caramel malts in the middle, and earthy moderately bitter hop notes on the finish. Other characters I get are subtle unsweetened cocoa, and some herbaceous but not quite floral notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice smoothness, perfect carbonation, and good drinkability. Overall a great beer. I’d put it slightly above the Korbinian I had earlier tonight.

Doppelbock Dunkel,4.04,"2021-04-16
500ml bottle served in a nonic pint. L2380 is the date on the bottle.

Pours a dark caramel-ruby color with a pretty large head that dissipates to a few millimeter thick layer. Smell is very toffee and raisins.

Taste is richer than the aroma, for sure. Definitely get the toffee and raisins, I get some dark toast, walnuts, maybe a hint of coffee or chocolate. Moderate molasses sweetness, light bitterness.

Mouthfeel is a bit thicker than other doppelbocks I've had recently. Not thick or chewy, just a noticeable and pleasant heft. Overall, this is a nice beer."
Doppelbock Dunkel,4.35,"Poured a dark mahogany and a light tan head that dissipated after several minutes.

Taste the sweet malt, black bread and toffee up front mixed with dark fruit and a non-bitter, lingering aftertaste. Medium-light mouthfeel and good carbonation."
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.46,"2019 Vintage; Stored under okay conditions (Stable environment, very little light)
The beer pours a nice off-white head that forms at a moderate pace: not too fast but gradual. The beer itself is a clear metallic amber color that looks very good.

The smell is absolutely wonderful. It starts off with light strawberry notes while cold and warms up to let through a variety of citrus fruit notes such as grapefruit, orange, a light lemon, and hints of lime that pop in and out. The funk note is moderate with hay notes to it.

The taste is very good. It has a strong citrus fruit note upfront that consists of grapefruit and a stronger lime note than in the smell. The funk shows up mostly as a musty hay not with a acidic tartness to it.

The feel is good. It has a light to medium body and moderate carbonation. It has moderate acidity.

Overall, a delicious cuvee worth getting and holding for a few years in ideal conditions ( away from light and stable temps)."
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.43,"A 750ml corked and capped bottle, 17/18 season, bottled on 18th December 2017. Poured into a Cantillon stemmed mini ballon glass.

Appearance: A clear golden orange colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving some lacing.

Aroma: Fruity, citrusy, mandarin peel, orange zest, peach, green apple, slight floral, damp wood, musty, funky.

Taste: Light to moderate sour, citrus, mandarin, orange zest and rind, peach, damp wood, barnyard, funky, earthy.

Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Quite different from most other lambics, and in a good way. Balanced, complex, refreshing, and very enjoyable to drink."

Dry hopped with Hallertauer (which Hallertauer?) hops. Hazy golden to deep golden colour, moderate white head. Aroma of farmhouse / brettanomyces, pediococcus and lemons. Lemony and tart / astingent flavour, quite dry, hints of oak. Fairly distinct herbal hops in the finish. Original rating: Bottle, as Cantillon Cuvée des Champions, at RBESG 2007 in Glasgow, Grand Tasting. Cloudy golden colour. Very nice lemony aroma, hints of oak and barnyard. Lemony and fairly dry flavour, refreshing and nice."
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.62,"AROMA - Fresh, bright, lightly acidic and floral. Notes of lemon, water chestnut, ginger, pear, honey, clover, berry skin.

FLAVOR - Light, brittle, mineral tartness pulls at sides of tongue. Melon notes, rhubarb, light citrus and spice, hint of pine, all very delicate and balanced, slightly bitter finish, very minimal earthy component

MF - light, velvety, medium-low carbonation, tart and tangy, lightly tannic"
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.37,2015 bottle in June 2020 in backyard w Lisa. Surprisingly good.
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.21,"Pours a cloudy, almost hazy, golden amber coloration with a medium, frothy head that recedes quickly. Smells of light, doughy, wheaty malt and fruity esters and floral hops, with notes of tart green apple/pear, apricot and white grape, as well as a distinct citric acidity and lighter notes of hay, oak and earthy, cheesy funk. Taste follows the nose, with a great balance of light, doughy wheat malt, fruity esters of tart green apple/pear, apricot, white grape and gooseberry, rather flowery, and slightly bitter, grassy and spicy hops, hay, a distinct citric acidity, earthy, cheesy funk and some musty oak. Finishes with a medium tartness, light bitterness and some fruity esters, floral hops and a distinct citric acidity lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfel with a medium body and carbonation.

I think this is quite a interesting modern take on Lambic that manages quite a nice balance of depth and refreshing drinkability with its strong traditional funk and oak presence, fruity esters and more modern bitter, floral hop notes, rounded out by quite a distinct, zesty, citric acidity that is pretty dominant here. It's not quite for me, to be honest, because I rather dislike floral hops and am not a huge fan of hoppy Saison either, but nonetheless this is quite superbly balanced and rather enjoyable for what it is, while the added element of a light bitterness, which traditional Lambic lacks, also makes for a nice interplay with the acidic tartness in the finish."
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.69,"Purchased in person in Brussels, BE at the brewery in Spring 2017. Managed to keep it cellared for this long (wow!). Bottle, corked and caged. Bottled on Jan 9, 2017. Cork read – Bottled in 16/17 season – Cantillon 2016. Enjoyed this one on Easter Sunday during the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. Served in a large wine glass.

The best lambic I have ever tasted. A very enjoyable pleasant drink. Refreshing. A wine-like experience. 4.75

A - Just a quiet pop when I pulled the cork. From the bottle a lovely fruity aroma. Pours a clear golden with a three-finger off-white head. Not as still as I thought based on the quiet pop of the cork. Nice viscosity on the glass. 4.75

S – Aromas of lactic acid, sweetness, faint fruitiness, and a hint of metallic. 4.5

T – Not as sour or tart as many lambics I have had before. Kumquat rind sourness that gives you that burst of sweetness inside. No bitterness. 4.75

MF – Light bodied with a dry finish. 4.75"
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.25,"Unknown vintage; drank 2/28/20 @ the Beer Temple.

This was a real pleasant treat; mildly tart with a refreshing fruitiness. Very easy to drink. Hope to have this again fairly soon!"
Cuvée Saint-Gilloise,4.16,"Just a few months old straight from the brewery, which is good for this particular Cantillon given the dry hop with HallertauMittelfrüh hops.
Hazy amber orange color with a thin head that vanishes quickly.
Nice elegant aroma with notes of initial faint damascus, noble hops, some fresh leather, grapefruit and lemon citrusy, a bit of honey and wood.
Flavor with notes of lemon, herbaceous hops, oak, green apple, spices, mild funk, grapefruit and faint pear. Dry and sour aftertaste.
Light body with appropriate carbonation.
Interest take on a Lambic with more hop flavors and still having traditional sourness to balance its malt sweetness. Very refreshing and balanced."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.39,"9.5% on the bottle.

Upon opening up this bottle, it gushed and lost nearly half the bottle. Not sure as to quality control with this one.

Appearance - Pours a copper brown with a finger of bubbly white head.

Smell - fruity esters of raisin, plum, and fig, low spicy hops, toffee malts, caramel, and earthy yeast.

Taste - fruity esters of raisin, plum, and fig upfront but not potent enough for the style. The hint of spicy hops come through next. The toffee malts, caramel, and earthy yeast round out the brew. The flavours are not that potent which is very dissapointing.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes a tad thin.

Overall - A disappointing brew that started off on the wrong foot. Nearly loosing half the beer due to gushing is a terrible sign of this brewery's quality control. Perhaps this was an off-bottle."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.71,"1.5 liter magnum bottle, RBESG 2005 Grand Tasting. ABV was 10%. Intense oaky and malty aroma. Flavour is also intensely oaky and moderately sweet. I probably drank it too warm, will need to rerate when available at cellar temperature. As it was, it’s not my definite favourite, but obviously a well crafted beer."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.12,"Lable has changed, it's now more text + subtle pared back indigo blue graphics on white than that pictured in the headers. ABV is marked as 9.5% instead of the 9.0% in the headers.
Front lable reads: 'Brasserie Des Rocs, Grand Cru, Belgian Special Brown Ale'.
L- Pours very rich intense chestnut brown, clear, though I see now some minor sediment was left in the bottle. 3mm pale tan head.
S- Pungent deep roasted fruits. Reminds me of British Xmas pudding. This is a good sign IME touch wood.
T- The Smell follows into the Taste, plus a little more somewhat dry and toasty edge on top. Perhaps that's what differentiates this from a Belgian tripel, which at this ABV% I'd expect to be much richer.
F- Pungent, quite a hefty feel. Somewhat dry for a 9.5% though, I notice in the subtle little lick of hoppy zing I get on my tongue/palate as I swallow. I think it's cleverly balanced.
O- Nice. It has a power and one that is quite reined in for 9.5% Nothing leaps out and beats you over the head. Nothing at all strikes me as at all out of balance. Very drinkable and I'd happily drink it again. This style would work best for me in colder months.... visions of kicking back and slow-sipping a couple of these in front of a log fire that maybe one day I'll own :)

Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.56,"Pours a hazelnut brown color with a huge, stable eggshell colored head.

Smells of milk chocolate, green peppers, allspice and anise. Quite forward on the spices, this manages to establish a balancing herbal hop presence on the nose, providing an intriguing depth.

Has a soft, medium bodied mouthfeel with a fitting, lighter effervescence during its finish.

Has a soft, almost aqueous beginning, followed up by bakers chocolate, cardamom and glazed toffee, together with a light note of dried leaves. Those produce a pleasant dryness, feathering the overall malt sweetness in this a bit, allowing for spicy licorice and a whiff of milk chocolate to cut through. Finishes with even more spicy, chewy licorice and sweeter turning chocolate among rock sugar and very light noble hops.

Quite pleasant with a great mouthfeel to it, this provides a classic belgian sweetness with a satisfying depth to it."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.54,"Listed as 9.5% on label, and as Brasserie des Rocs. Normal quad dried fruit aromas and flavors, abrupt finish, cloying sweetness. I had hoped for better based on the overall score."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.28,"Best before Feb 18, 2020 - this version is 9.5% ABV - enjoyed (Canadian) Thanksgiving 2019.
Pours a coppery deep caramel brown with abundant cream coloured head with orangey highlights - clear but significant debris from a ? poorly poured bottle.
Sweet caramel, toffee, yeasty Belgian spices, raisin, brown sugar, and a bit of booziness on the nose.
Taste follows - delicious caramel, Belgian spice, toffee, dark fruits, a touch of booze on a backbone of malty sweetness.
Medium bodied but briskly carbonated leading to a creamy deliciously sweet finish,
The floating debris was a bit unnerving but else this was fantastic."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.32,"Pours a murky brown color with a medium top off beige head that dissolves quickly.
Aroma is of caramel, toffee,cocoa, bread, dark and dried fruits, anis, vanilla and spices. Getting a christmas cake feel off the aroma.
The flavour follows the nose. Sweet with dark and dried fruit notes and strong malt notes innen the back with nice notes off caramel, dark bread and cocoa . It then gets more hints off spices in the flavour before finishing with some slight bitter notes balanced nicely with the malt background. Nice strenght and lenght in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a full body and a soft carbonation.
With two words: really delicious."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.17,"750 ml bottle served fairly cold into a chalice. LCBO purchase for only $6.45 CDN. Best before October 8, 2020. Listed at 10% ABV. Review from notes.

Appearance - Dark red, minimal haze and two big fingers of off white head that sits on top and fizzles out pretty quick.

Smell - Intense brown sugar and caramel blend with marshmallow, hints of dark fruit and some spices. Plums and figs show up here too. Wonderfully aromatic and many transitions in between these aromas as it warms and adding liquorice as it goes.

Taste - Only mildly sweet despite the bouquet. Caramel and restrained dark fruits prevail with some dank wood and yeasty flavors. Wood and booze show up to close.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, light on carbonation and a slightly spicy finish from spices and the ABV.

Overall - A pretty damn good BSDA that stands up to par with even the best of them. Well worth a visit and a very good value buy here too."
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.14,750 ml bottle; $6.45 from the LCBO. Poured into my Duvel tulip at 11 C. Lots of head that quickly settles. Second glass had floaties that I was able to leave in the bottle. Nice amber colour; Not too sweet. A solid BSDA
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,4.44,"Had on tap. Fantastic belgian strong dark ale. A little more creamy than expected, but hey, I don't hate it. Just bursting with all the standard flavors, dark fruits, raisin, cocoa, malts, hops, and lovely dark belgian spices. Feels like a belgian with brown ale and stout characteristics on certain sips. Lovely ale!"
Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru Belgian Special Brown,3.6,"Hazy brown color with frothy beige head. Aroma has toasted malt, earthy notes, some cacao and light molasses. Taste is quite balanced.

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.21,"Who says that you can't have brunch at night, or that you can't have one on Tuesday? Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like.

Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.

And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.

Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate."
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.48,"2020 bottle, slight improvement on an already great beer."
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.29,"Pours dark and a bit on the thin side. Thin head fades quite quickly. Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee. Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,5,"Disclaimer: Not a professional beer-rater. Just enjoy a nice tasty beer.

-Enjoying this fine porter on release day (01/25/2020). Poured straight from the bottle into a tulip glass.

-Shallow pour shows a nice brown color. Appears black and turbid in a full glass but the nice brown color remains on the edges. Head is a nice light brown, which died down pretty quickly. Not very much lacing.

-Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really.

-Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%.

-Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation.

-Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5."

T: Mango up front, then orange and tangerine. Finishes with grapefruit and a slightly dry bitterness. The flavors are encased by a supercharged hop character that creates a mild astringency.

F: Soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.

O: Enjoyable flavor profile but docked a notch for the hop burn."
JJJuiceee Machine,4.28,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/22. Space juice. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.

Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.

Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.

Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.

Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had. I could actually see myself drinking this on the regular, if my throat didn’t clench up and choke me to death."

JJJuiceee Machine,4.4,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
06/01/22
Served in a tulip

Cloudy yellow ochre appearance. The turbid looking body was topped by a small, creamy, bright white crown that slowly transformed into a thin dollop of froth. Streaky, drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drink’s end.

The aroma was impressive. Really fruity and bold. Honeydew melon notes were most prominent. Peach and apricot also came through strong. Good dose of sticky mango too. Nice citrus presence as well. Juicy orange notes stuck out. After the head died down, the dry, chalky, proprietary Tree House yeast character appeared.

The flavor profile was very solid. Big honeydew melon presence up front. Loads of ripe peach too. Citrus notes took over mid palate. Nice melding of sweet, juicy orange and tangy tangerine. White grapefruit appeared on the back end. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes rounded things out in the finish.

Excellent smooth, creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and slick on the palate.

Like the original Juice Machine, this beer was super fruity and bright up front but quite pithy and bitter on the finish. Although I really enjoyed it, there are many Tree House IPAs that are better."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.74,"I warmed to this beer slowly, but it's now easily my favorite KBS variant, as well as my favorite stout from Founders overall. Title implies the stout may be sickeningly sweet, but there is nothing excessive here. It still tastes like beer, not a dessert, and it makes for a great sipper. And contrary to some comments made by others, I found the stout thick, like a few stouts that have been condensed. As for price, I've become more accepting. I would not be willing to pay $8 for a 6 oz pour at a bar (unless I was already drunk), but paying $5 or $6 per 12 oz bottle seems an acceptable transaction. (As for the ""hazelnut"" variant, I'd rather a few Guinness.)"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.35,"Pours a thick dark brown with a tight, small cappuccino head.

Big aroma on this beer. Sweetened coffee, chocolate. Some maple as it warmed. A little indistinct booze.

The taste follows, but fuller. Creamy sweet coffee. Milk chocolate. A hint of maple. Alcohol.

Body is on the thinner side despite the rather thick looking pour.

This is a great variant of the original, a beer I like quite a bit. Given the choice between a KBS and this, I might choose this one."
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,4.4,"Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours nearly black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves some very nice lacing.

S: Decadent chocolate fudge, some coffee, roasty earthy notes, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, and faint oak, and hints of toasted coconut.

T: Big chocolate fudge runs the show up front, followed by coffee, vanilla, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, a touch of maple, roasty earthy notes, and faint hints of toasted coconut and oak.

M: Medium to full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth, alcohol is nearly completely hidden, crazy drinkable for a sweet 11%.

O: The second I heard about this beer it topped my wants list, so it's nice to finally dive into a bottle.
I really grew to appreciate this one the more it warmed and opened up. It's a big sweet dessert stout, the first few sips make that very clear, and they absolutely nailed the fudge factor. It's also surprisingly easy to drink for something so big and sweet, which I came to realize is due to the solid foundation of coffee that kept peeking out more and more as my glass emptied. Is it my favorite form of KBS, probably not. But it makes a fantastic desert beer."

Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.02,"Bottle Date: 2016
Palate Contaminants: other beer

Color is super dark brown that doesn't let any light through, even at the edges. Head is relatively dark, like a chocolate mousse, and the carbonation is fine.

Smell has a lot of prunes, and it's fairly floral. Slightly metallic. I hope I didn't let it sit too long.

Maybe I did. Prunes are still there, and there's lots of charred barrel. Some vague red wine grape, too. Any chocolate is not from the usually eaten part of the plant, more like tree nut husks. I might have a better impression if I was having it with barbecue. Yeah, there's oak, but it doesn't stand well as a flavor in this brew.

Alcohol is pretty well hidden, and the weight is medium for type. Aftertaste is metal and charred wood. Carbonation is fine, but prickly with a swish around the mouth."

Initial impression is dark chocolate, oak, coffee, and roasted malts. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is medium thick, but I was expecting thicker and creamier. Alcohol is remarkably well hidden. Finish is somewhat bitter and a little astringent. Not my favorite Imperial Stout by a long shot, but not bad."
Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.04,"Just when I thought I had reviewed every Yeti out there, here comes one I haven't. Man these have been around, 10 years ago, these were pretty highly sought. Don't hear much these days, but that shouldn't take away from the beer's goodness. Pours a rich black with 2/3"" brown head. Aroma hits the standard roasted and chocolate malt combo along with a sturdy presence of oak on it. Did not know it was both french and American, would say the American is the stronger of the two in this beer, whereas usually french is more noticeable for me. Definitely fits the ""oaky"" descriptor either way.

Taste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%. Solid chewy mouth feel throughout.

Its a good beer, should be interesting to see if it survives as bombers have fallen from grace, I believe they moved the base version into a 4 pack, so who knows what the future holds for this beer that probably deserves to be in the Hall of Fame at this point."
Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.44,"Pours jet black with a thick espresso colored head. Huge coffee aroma with loads of chocolate intermingled. Flavor is overwhelming bitter espresso, fudge, loads of dark roasted malt, touch of vanilla, tannins from the oak chips round off the bitter finish. Thick and viscous, full bodied with creamy carbonation. Overall a very Espresso flavored beer, aged nicely.

Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.48,"Not quite as good as the Espresso variant, but still very good and unique. Looking to see how this ages past 2yrs where I'll have to revisit my review."
Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.16,"2015 vintage stored lovingly, poured from bottle into the test glass.
A - Chalkboard backdrop, conceals, determined carbonation. Proof is the relentless mocha cap, and fine French lacing that clings to the inside of the glass.
S - Bakers chocolate, bourbon barrel, toffee, roast malts, hints of cinnamon, alcohol, rises off the glass, then followed by dried dark fruits, touch of coffee, red raspberry, and tobacco broad leaf.
T - After that aromatic introduction the flavors follow quite well, add some tannin's from the barrel, black pepper, a touch of anise
M - Large feel, rich and bold, starts semi sweet, transitions to a softer feel, bitterness is a theme, the finish is luxurious,
lingering on the cocoa meets bourbon date.
O - Glad to have experienced this with a few years of rest, the feel connotes dessert, the slightly boozy tends to the adult side of our desires. Well worth seeking out, I will try a fresh version against the last 2015 bottle I have resting comfortably. This will be a nice taste test"
Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.3,"The oak barrel aging definitely smoothed out the rough alcohol bite that the regular yeti has. In addition to, the oak barrel has also lessened the chocolate brownie notes that I got with the regular yet, Those notes have mellowed a little bit. It's easier to drink because I don't want to drink a beer that taste like a boozy piece of fudge brownie, but it's nowhere close to being better than the Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. Cheers! A-"
Pirate Bomb!,4.15,"Black in color with no penetration to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and and covering a third of the top. The aroma is of chilies, rum, and coffee. I’m tasting chilies, vanilla, cacao, and rum. The mouth is warm from the chilies and otherwise chewy."
Pirate Bomb!,3.61,"12 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase.

Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.

Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.

Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky. The vegetable note really throws me. Maybe this one sat too long, the date code is all but invisible on the bottle."
Pirate Bomb!,4.99,Fantastic! The rum taste really comes thru.
Pirate Bomb!,4.44,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Aroma first of fusel alcohols, then molasses, rum oak cask, vanilla, coconut, chocolate and roast malts. Rich and warming mouthfeel. Outstanding flavour, medium sweet and roasty, no sign of fusel, otherwise all the delicious notes from the aroma are repeated and strengthened here. Nice chili heat in the finish. Perfect!"
Pirate Bomb!,4.5,Pours black. Brown head. Aroma is a combination of vanilla bean and Chile pepper coffee. Taste is the same. Silky smooth. Rum barrels round everything out. Overall delicious with that spicy punch.
Pirate Bomb!,4.25,Good. But not as good as bourbon paradise
Pirate Bomb!,4.25,"On tap - this is the July 2019 batch, so 15 months old.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing.

Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it.

Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.

Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts.

Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board."
Pirate Bomb!,4.52,Didn’t get near as much chili in this one as the original bomb which made me enjoy it more. I really enjoyed the rum finish
Pirate Bomb!,4.58,"**
09/06/20

Bottle to snifter. Bottled in July 2019, so about 13-14 months old.

Labor Day weekend picnic.

LOOK: thick oily black, small medium brown head.
AROMA: coffee, cocoa, rum and vanilla very nice.
TASTE: cocoa. Coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper kick is just right. Very tasty.
FEEL: full bodied, light carbonation, sticky on the tongue which allows the pepper to linger just nice.

Very special stout. Glad I have 2 more of these to age since in general I've found rum BA to need a bit more time than Bourbon BA to mellow out.

Probably my favorite Prairie now.

Blue Moon Belgian White,3.95,"Only really enjoyable as a draft beer, but a great choice to sit on the patio with in the summer."
Blue Moon Belgian White,2.46,"It's, by all definitions, a beer. A Belgian White beer, even. Looks like a Belgian White. Tastes like a Belgian White is supposed to taste. Cloudy appearance. Crisp. Delicate malt. Orange peel notes.
It's okay. It's a beer. Not bad at all. Easy on the way down. A little lacking in all its flavors. I find myself wishing for something more.
I buy it because it's everywhere, literally everywhere, usually inexpensive, and because for all it lacks as a drinking beer, it is more than adequate for deglazing caramelized onions (5s across the board to caramelized onions). And then, when I'm done making caramelized onions, I still have 5 bottles of Blue Moon left, and I drink them between my usual picks (which are not as good for caramelizing onions), and I don't complain about them. Decent beer. Drinkable."
Blue Moon Belgian White,5,"Blue Moon is definitely one of my favorite beers, very tasty. U can definitely taste the orange and it goes down easy. For some reason I like Blue Moon as a draft beer, I like how it looks in a beer mug and it just taste real fresh."
Blue Moon Belgian White,2.96,It’s a decent beer that you can get anywhere
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.18,"Nice color and head as well as a good aroma for a Belgian white. The flavor, however, leaves more to be desired. Softly malty with just the slightest touch of clove and orange. Very summery and a decent introduction to the style, but I wish it were a bit more robust."
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.76,Goes down easy. Nice summer brew.
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.5,"Anyone who buys beer for social events knows that there are two choices: dirt cheap light beers that you drink not to enjoy, but to ""crush"", and higher quality inexpensive beers that still might not taste good, but leave your guests with the impression that you give at least half a damn about them. Blue Moon and its derivatives fall into the second category. This one, being the flagship beer of Blue Moon (read: Coors+), can be found in anywhere there is running water and electricity. I admit I've never smelled it because I don't want to be the guy at the party who freakin' smells a beer. The taste is mild wheat with a touch of sweetness. If I close my eyes and use my imagination I can make some citrus and spice appear. Not much besides breadiness, but it is a good breadiness. There is no industrial quality to it that you typically get from mass-produced beers. No complaints about the carbonation or mouthfeel. I might even say that I enjoyed it (a bit). Of all the wheat beers I've had, this is certainly one of them. It's hard to feel enthusiasm for a common wheat beer (it would be like getting excited over sliced bread), but for what it's worth, this is one of the better macrobrews."
Blue Moon Belgian White,4.47,"My favorite feel from almost any beer I've had! Taste was pretty good, but the feel and look were the highlights for me. It was really crisp, with the right amount of bubbles. Great!"
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.45,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pilsner glass at around 55 degrees. Huge head on aggressive pour. Head slowly dissipates. No lacing to speak of. Hazy light golden color.

S - Citrus scent is font and center. I get a juicy scent as well. A little light grain malt. Sweetness on the back end.

T - Taste is much more subdued and less in-your-face citrus. The citrus scent is balanced out with the light hop flavors. Mild grain malts.

F - Mouthfeel is very good. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

O - Overall this is an enjoyable beer. It’s no wonder Blue Moon is so popular. To me this is one of the better beers for enjoying outdoors. Very refreshing, but has more to it than other macrobrews. I’ve somehow avoided this one for years, but I think this will be added to my summer and camping beer rotation."
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.24,On-tap; hazy bright orange. Modest wheat/malt breadiness and a good dose of orange peel; the nose delivers some fruity citrus character but the body and palate is more flat and basic. Decent.
Blue Moon Belgian White,3.31,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Fresh Market for $1.78. Poured into a nonic pint glass. Served sans orange slice.

L - Hazy goldenrod, with a quick-to-dissipate two-finger pale white head.
S - Faint orange peel. Hinting at some sort of spice. Wheat.
T - First off, crazy well-balanced! Starts off on a chewy wheat note, and continues to a coriander finish. Notes of very light caramel throughout.
F - Smooth. Oily on the finish. Medium-light body, with medium carbonation. Chewy. Easy-to-drink, and refreshing.
O - Not bad. Not the first time I've had this, either. This is probably the tastiest beer you could bring to a party and not look like a douche. A great lunch beer. It's everywhere beer is sold, too - so bonus points for that. I'll definitely buy this again, but I won't really go out of my way for this. It's my go-to for beer runs and BBQ parties."
Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.45,"Bottle, graciously shared by Clark at Peg’s. Dark brown pour with a light brown head. Inviting vanilla bean and coco puff aromas. Sweet with delicious vanilla, rich caramel, decadent chocolate, and woody notes. Some heat from the whiskey, but not overwhelming. More of a backbeat really. Doesn’t drink like a 12%er. Smooth, but complex with a very good mouthfeel and body. Bravo......"
Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.68,"Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 (had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations, making me 20 short again...)

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.

Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.

The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.

The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!

Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts! The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something!"
Vanilla Bean Assassin,5,"As far as vanilla barrel ages stouts go, it is hard to name a better one than this. Very sweet, but just short of cloying. The huge fudge notes blend perfectly with that intense vanilla marshmallow presence. Don't miss out on this one if you have a chance to get some!"
Vanilla Bean Assassin,4.69,2019 bottle
Exponential Hoppiness,4.4,"From a month-old pint can, pours a very clear darkish-gold. Small white head with little lacing, as you'd expect from this ABV. Smell and taste are classic West Coast IPA, with pine and honey malt in balance. Good hit of bitterness in the finish. No trace of alcohol, medium feel. Great beer."
Exponential Hoppiness,4.37,"Notes from 12/20/2019

On tap in a half pint snifter at The Draft House Austin Texas.
Look is golden and a little cloudy. There is almost no head because the staff pour carefully to the brim to give you more beer. 4.25
Smell is hops, citrus, stone fruit, and a little spice. 4.00
Taste is mango, citrus, alcohol, some malt, pine, and moderate bitterness. 4.5
Feel is medium and a little slick. 4.5
Overall it is a big IPA with a lot going on. It's too much for me to drink it offten but it is a great beer. 4.5"
Exponential Hoppiness,4.36,"On tap at SD Taproom. Pours a slightly hazy golden with decent off white head. Aroma sweet citrus with some pineapple and ample hoppy pine. Taste is sweet malty with pine, citrus, some peach - resinous hoppy pine bitterness hits at the back end after swallow. Alcohol is well hidden in this full bodied slightly oily sweet but pleasantly bitter monster IPA. Absolutely great."
Exponential Hoppiness,3.71,"Bottle at RBSG. Light haze, golden body, substantial head. Aroma is equal parts hops and citrus. Nice feel and consistency, hops get more astringent on the palate. Citrus finish with a bit of warmth."
Cable Car,4.53,"2019 version, drank 06.19.22 out of a Hill Farmstead bulbous wine glass. Straw color with very delicate islands of head but other than that, not to much there. Not too much nose either. Funky and acidy taste, strong. Very pungent, strong and tasty. Pretty amazing beer. Just wow."
Cable Car,4.9,"#71, yum!"
Cable Car,4.59,"2016 poured from fridge on 5/20/21

Pours a clean straw. Nose of white wine, somewhat jammy (cherry, strawberry?), Funk and barnyard, and honey as it warms. Taste of funk, jammy characteristics, vinous. Feel is light with medium carb. Overall, wow! What an excellent wild and held up very well."
Cable Car,4.53,"I assumed this beer wouldn’t live up - but it was great. Not too sour, complex with some interesting wine character, went well with Portillos Italian beef!"
Cable Car,4.43,"Clear straw and slightly golden with a little carbonation and no real head.

Smells of Fresh grain, malt, sour
White wine and white grapes.

The taste is All sour, fresh but light lacto with Cantillion like oak and dusty cellar. Continues with fresh harvested apples and white grapes.

Light and tart body with moderate carbonation

Cable Car,4.06,"Culmination Festival, 07/28/2018."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.4,"Pours a golden blonde color with a near crystal clear transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam, with more build up after a light swirl of the glass. This frothy, pillowy foam sits a top for a long while after the pour. There is visible sediment at the base of the bottle; however, only the first 3/4 of the bottle were poured into the glass for this review. Aroma is punchy grass, herbal, medicinal, and spicy hops with a big cut of spicy yeast just behind. This yeast comes paired with clove, apple cider, and earthy malts. It smells light, and yet thick; that is to say, the breadth of notes is pretty simple, but the depth to each note is huge. Flavor profile driven by the same characteristics. It pits resiny, herbal, grassy, spicy hops against earthy, bready malt undertones. Clove pairs with spicy yeast for a little further zest and grit. Mouth feel has a sharp effervescence, at least, initially. Effervescence bubbles down to a thin crisp texture. It has a medium thickness. Overall, really stellar depth here, while remaining easy to drink. It's on the 'easier drinking' side of the Belgium spectrum, and yet still retains a remarkable depth.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.66,"More yellow than copper, lacing foam.

Clean hops, maybe salt, no malt.

Finishes with more than a touch of hops, hardly bitter, touch of honey. Nothing's really jumping at me.

Nothing if not easy going and clean and dry."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.56,"A lot of the time one simply wakes up because they are alive, but not that they want to. With Westy Blond in the fridge though, I sprung up like James Brown on a line of snow.

And?

Glorious. Just glorious. It doesn’t hit you, it caresses you like Adriana Lima putting on a pair of panties.

I can’t anymore because I need to get back to it.

Be well. Be oh so well."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.77,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Pale gold, it was pouring clear until some minor sediment lifted right near the end. 3Cm creamy/lumpy white foam head with some sediment left in the bottle. There is unusually vigorous ongoing small-bubble rising CO2 in the glass. Holds well and forms lacing on the way down.
S- Classic Belgian yeast notes, lightly estery + a hint of spice. Overall a bit subtle though.
T- Follows the smell^ but the hops are brighter and dryer than anticipated (that was my 1st sip of beer today). On swallowing the hops leave a zingy dry brush over my palate that lingers for 10+ seconds. There might also be a fruit note within it too, perhaps apple. - In one respect you could feel this is like a 'hipstered' wheat/wit/weiss beer, it has most of the latter notes but the hops are notably amped up.
F- As above, bright, refreshing, one for a hot summers day.
O- It's very nice and elegant, there is nothing that seems out of place or balance. - But apart from what I paid for it is it something seriously amazing, well I'm not pursuaded. I've had plenty of other similar style beers to this and this isn't *that* stand-out. So I'll rate it honestly based upon that.
Review #1900. 330ml bottle BB: Not marked, though it tastes fresh and I understand this one has a 12month shelf-life, and the 'Westie 8 and 12' have three years. Bought from Belgium."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.1,"Shared with a friend on June 6, 2021.

It looks the part with its light amber golden and very heady pour.

The aroma is toasted bread with light Belgian yeast. It is all very subtle.

The body is smooth and light to medium.

The taste was sweet, toasty, and bready with a vague spiciness behind it. It was quite a treat."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.92,"Poured the color of apple cider and was opaque enough to not see through but it seemed to block no light. The head was impressive and slow to recede, never going away completely. Beautiful beer.
The aroma was spice forward and hinted at fruit, but I couldn’t define which. I can say it smelled wonderful.
The taste followed the aroma- spice would lead the way and be enveloped in the malts midway through. So enjoyable and refreshing.
Flat out an amazing beer, thank you Mark for sending this my way!"
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.5,"I reviewed this blind, courtesy of my beer nerd friend wunderlama.

The pour is a hazy golden color with a white head. So definitely not Westie XII. But could it be another member of the Westie family? The nose features that estery fruit quality noted with the Trappist beers, so check. There’s also something that reminds me of coriander. And lemon. Definitely lemon.

The taste has that coriander flavor, and there’s a significant lemon note, and those fruity esters are prominent as well. The mouthfeel is fairly dry.

This is truly a phenomenally delicious beer, rated 4.5. I’m calling it Westie Blond, only because the color says it can’t be 8 or 12."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.02,"330 ml bottle (green cap), at Amundsen, Oslo. ABV is 5.8%. Served in a Chimay chalice. Golden colour, large white head. Pleasant spicy / peppery aroma, also notes of yeast and white kandij sugar syrup. High level of carbonation. The flavour is fairly dry and crisp, peppery with fairly bitter hops in the finish."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.31,"Foggy straw gold with a tall pillowy eggshell white head settling in lumps with thick retention.

After all the whacky American Blondes I've been having lately, this old world perfection is a refreshing knockout. It's body is just a perfect medium fluff, delivering mild phenolic spice, light wheat, and even a touch of pils-like bitterness. As it warms, it also get some light toast, some corn, and a hint of clove, finishing with a semi-dry tingle.

Delicious."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.21,"Bottle from Etre
Pours a brilliant light gold color with a huge rocky white head that shows great retention. Rich bready crackery maltiness with a touch of honey. Earthy spicy hop and peppery yeast phenols to counter. Delicate flavorful well crafted beer."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.47,"330ml bottle poured into a stemmed tulip

Serving temperature is 47.8 degrees F

Massive three finger, dense , creamy white foam cap. Looks like I could float a cap on it. The mass of white recedes like a slow elevator, in mass and slowly descending. Lacings are dappled all across the glass and after five minutes it rests at a pencil thick rich creamy island. Yellow liquid is translucent with an occasional streams of carbonation . I believe the technical term that cicerones would use to describe the appearance is , “F**king awesome.”

First aroma is lemon citrus rind, whiff of yeast . I swirl and cover the glass and get lemon, coriander , cloves and fresh ground peppercorns . Third aroma is lemon , yeast and peppercorn

Taste is gentle lemon on the first sip followed by yeast and cloves with a hint of Peppercorns . Not overbearing but subtle and delicious

Smooth , very low sudsing mouthfeel , quenching

Trappist Westvleteren Blond,5,"Once again the Sint Sixtusabdij monks have created a near perfect blond ale with nice light not notes and a distinctive ale flavor that is refreshing, aromatic, lightly effervescent, and most enjoyable when served slightly chilled. While the aroma is not strong, it is nice a subtle giving hints of the refreshing flavor within the liquid. Like the other abbey products this one bottle ages very well and if you can hold off for a year or more the results are worth the wait and make a great beer amazing!"
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.29,"(330 ml bottle, cap date 06.20; purchased in Belgium by my bro, shipped to US; chilled for 5 days before opening... decanted into fat tulip)

L: yellow (blond) liquid, slight haze; tall, rocky, white mountain of foam on the pour, slow recede, leaving several thin rings of lace, a thin-skin cap, and a cauliflower island clinging to the glass to one side

S: dough, flower juice, dried lemon peel; bold spice accents off mild grapefruit and bubblegum (and maybe champagne) undertones... nothing particularly unique, but moderately-bold intensity and expression... two sips in and a latrine scent develops

T: spicy kiss ahead of dry, bready malt wave; actually relatively bready in the initial aftertaste... after the second sip, a citrus pithy bitterness starts to emerge in the aftertaste, coupled with a floral spice; still rather dry... the addition of the dregs enhances the biscuity quality of the malt

F: dry, extra-light, subtly-oily finish, with the ample foaming providing a soft, feathery texture; bit of spicy warmth builds in the very back of the palate, giving the lean, shapeless body a bit of needed contrast

O: perhaps a touch too dry at this stage of its bottled life... I've tasted all these flavors before, but they're lovely and bold here, and I do love the malt expression in this, a great balance in that direction instead of a sugar-derived character... glad to have finally tried this, but only worth seeking out for the tick (1593)"
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,4.1,"Drank at the source
Slightly hazy solid golden color with a thick thin head.
Aroma with notes of fresh local hops, mild banana, pineapple tartness, pears, orange-lemon and candied sugar.
Flavor with notes of floral, medicine and piney hops, lots of pears, bread malt, oranges, coriander, yeast, elegant tartness and lemon drops. Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness.
Light to medium body with perfect carbonation.
This Belgian Blonde is far more balanced than other Belgian counterparts that puts too much candied sugar and not enough hops. Best I had for the style. And to have it really fresh is priceless, hops are shining through. Likely you won't have it similarly elsewhere with all non-official exports."
Trappist Westvleteren Blond,3.76,"Bottle bought at Oasis Beer some years ago, served at home in a Westvleteren glass. Pours a pale golden colour, small head with very short retention, no lacing.
Aroma of citrics, malt, pear, banana, ripen fruit, and, because of the time that has passed at home a bit of acetone.
Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Sugary finish.
Taste of pear, ripen fruit, citricas, banana, brown sugar.
Guess I have to try some time another one that is no overaged, but at first impression, is excelent."
Expedition Stout,4.24,"New to me, and a solid daily drinker; for an RIS, to me at least! I use Old Rasputin as my benchmark, but this one is not expensive and delivers on flavor! Unlike the famous ones that have 10% more flavor and 50% more cost. Dark pour from chilled bottle in to 12oz. pint glass. Some head, decent. Motor oil consistency; can't see through it. Just a hint of fruit sweetness, but not overly so. Not sure where the sweetness comes from, but it is muted. Great roasted, coffee, dark chocolate, malty flavor. Nice mouthfeel; just about right for RIS. This has some smokiness to it (for me), and I love that. It has both a bit of sweet and bitter finish. But walks the line pretty well here; not going overly one direction. Nice after dinner drink by the fire!"
Expedition Stout,3.43,"If you’re looking for a really thick, heavy beer, this is it. I like Guinness and Leine’s dark (among others), but this one is a bit thick and heavy for me. It certainly has chocolate tones."
Expedition Stout,4.23,"L - Deep black with a tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind a thin cap and some lacing
S - Roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some dart fruit. Smell is pretty faint however
T - roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, some molasses, some hop notes. Some charred notes. Hints of coffee.
F - full bodied, light carbonation. Smooth.
O - a well done, yet simple imperial Russian stout."
Expedition Stout,4.74,"12 oz bottle, born on 11/11/19, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:

T - Roasted malt, molasses, char, dark chocolate, coffee, lot's going on
F - thick mouthfeel minimal carbonation
O - excellent, my favorite Bell's beer"
Expedition Stout,4.54,"Found this one in our local grocery store known for a manager who loves his brews. After opening the first bottle, I immediately lifted the bottle to my nose. The aroma of a malting barn hit me. The heavy, rich, sweet aroma took me back to my days baling wet hay on the family farm. Organic, real, substantive, with sweet smells. Very few beers have hit me this way. The taste was rich and full. I may have found the beer to replace Dragon’s Milk as my second favorite after Founder’s KBS."
Expedition Stout,4.46,"One seriously tasty brew. I haven’t tried it much due to the price point but I think that’s been my loss. Bottled 9/21 consumed 10/21. Great now but what might happen w time?
L: from the bottle. Classic stylish.
S: coffee chocolate. Toffee? Nice!
T: almost smoky. Bittersweet chocolate. Lots of bitterness. Powerful. I like it.
F: kind of forgot about it. Nice but after the taste who cares?
O: helluva offering. Worthy!"
Expedition Stout,4.37,"Bottled 9/3/20. Poured at 57°.

Roast bitterness, char and burnt brown sugar up front; bittersweet dark chocolate, chocolate brownie batter; raisins; roast coffee as beer warms; star anis and molasses on backend. Medium full body, moderate minus carbonation; some warmth from 11.5% abv; dryish finish. Overall, layers of flavors, however, at almost one year old the char/bitterness is still strong with a long bitter linger; a tasty RIS, yet more bitter roast than I want…it would be interesting to see how this beer tastes in a few years."
Expedition Stout,4.44,"Black beauty with a nice tan head. Unusually complex flavor profile brings chocolate and dark fruit on parade for your palate. It is hearty, in your face, yet smooth and beautifully blended."
Expedition Stout,4.31,"Bottle conditioned. Cellared since 2015. Almost black with a dark tan, frothy head which recedes to a lasting thin layer.
Rich aroma of chocolate, coffee with dark rum and raisin fudge.
A bittersweet cacophany of flavours reflecting the bouquet. Charred bitter finish.
Full in body. Viscous. Soft carbonation.
Deserves the accolades."
Expedition Stout,4,"Had it a few nights ago. Have had it before. Delish Imp Stout. Mapley, molasses notes."
Expedition Stout,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass

Look: Opaque pitch black with a thick mocha head

Smell: Rich bittersweet coffee, hops, coffee,

Taste: Big bold bittersweet coffee up front that gets blasted away by bitter floral and pine hop that stick to the palate and slowly fades to notes of coffee and honey toast

Feel: Big and rich. Not cloying but still clings to the palate with bold bitterness. Medium alcohol. Good carbonation.

Overall: A Russian imperial stout that isn’t afraid to show off the hoppy side of the style. Solid."
Midnight Still,4.53,2020 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. This is nicely thick with a strong fudge flavor.
Midnight Still,4.33,"Poured oily black with a brown head. Most of the head disappeared pretty quickly, but coated the edges of the glass like the ring of a solar eclipse. Aromas of leather, pipe tobacco, coconut pudding, black cherries.
Flavors are rich, with a ton of dark chocolate, oaky bourbon, and charred marshmallow.
Mouthfeel is full, and the dense carbonation smooths it out. Finishes dry with dark chocolate bitterness on the palate."
Midnight Still,4.18,"2020 vintage (released on 2/14/20, so presumably bottled within a few days of that date); consumed on 2/4/21

Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end, as well.

Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.

Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.

From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings."
Midnight Still,4.52,"2020 vintage - split with jrc1093 because wowweeweewoah what a champ he is.

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill.

Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth.

Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation.

Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books."
Midnight Still,5,2020 Edition. Bourbon Milky Creamy Delicacy.
Midnight Still,4.34,"Had this Sep 3, 2016 as part of corpulent's birthday jam. Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe.

Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient.

Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9.

I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch."
Midnight Still,4.77,"Novare Res Stoutfest 2020.

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.

S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.

T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.

MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.

The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day."
Midnight Still,4.6,"2019 bottle purchased at the July 2019 release enjoyed on 9/26/19.
L: Dark deep brown black with fizzed lacing. No retained head.
S: Inviting pleasant bourbon, chocolate, boozy raisins, and stone fruit.
T: Smooth barrel aged roasted stout malt. Sweetness of layered chocolate, essence of coffee, whisky barrel and toasted sugar caramel.
F: Sticky, silky, just thick enough. Subtle bourbon bite, and lingering tacky sweetness.
O: Beyond expectations, smooth, and extremely drinkable for the strength. Delicious."
La Folie,4.75,"Great example of the style. Well balanced and delicious! Just the right amount of sour, and a wonderful depth of flavor. Just right for a before dinner quaff. I love this beer!"

Great outside on a Late spring evening!"
La Folie,3.94,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. 2017 vintage.

Ruddy brown hue. Minimal to no head.

Aroma of oaky tannins, light cherry-berry, dark maltiness.

Flavor is also dominated by oak tannins, dark fruit like date and prune, and a lighter but pleasant lightly sour bacterial note.

Mouthful is surprisingy light.

A very nice approachable sour brown ale."
La Folie,3.58,"I definitely need to have this a couple times, this is the first of this specific style I've had as well so I've nothing to compare it to. I feel like I've had other things I like better that hit similar tasting notes but this definitely isn't bad. Will need to have again for sure."
La Folie,4.09,Good stuff but quite sour and not that complex. Still it's really in style and it's balanced overall. The sourness takes you for a ride. Almost citric
La Folie,4.5,"Look: Clear, very dark brown/amber color with a nice head and decent lacing.

Smell: Cherry, oak, flanders' funkiness, and yeast.

Taste: Taste is similar to the smell. Cherry, French oak, funk, and yeast.

Feel: Mouthfeel is surprisingly nice. Not overly sour, nicely carbonated, very easy drinking.

Overall: This beer really surprised me. I'm rating it higher than it's current score."

La Folie,2,"Notes from 5/19/2020.
Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is dark amber with 1.5 fingers of tan head. Retention is average leaving a thin island of foam.
The intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of fruit, some funk, and oak. Also, there's a dirty diaper smell. It smells like a disposable diaper that's full of baby shit. How unfortunate. I hope it fades and fast.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. The taste has berries, oak, and is super tart. There's a strong wine quality. The shit filled diaper smell comes and goes. I find myself taking a whiff before each sip to make sure the coast is clear of dirty diapers.
The feel is medium in thickness. It's slightly syrupy, has almost no carbonation, and a medium astringency.
Overall, besides the dirty diaper smell, it's far too tart for my taste. With the shit filled diaper smell, it's appropriately ranked #2."
La Folie,4.28,"A: appears opaque and cola brown, but if held to the light, it's mahogany and crystal clear; 1 finger tan head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;

S: funky, fruity, vinegary, sour, white grapes;

T: sour cherries and vinegar with a hint of vanilla; a little green apple at the end;

M: light to medium bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish;

O: surprised at how well the head stood up; really nice complexity in the aroma and flavor; I didn't notice much oak character;"
Organic Chocolate Stout,3.9,"Remember when you were a kid and poured chocolate syrup all over your pancakes at a restaurant? This is the beer equivalent: a nice mellow porter with a rich chocolatey taste, a little bit acidic toward the high end, but thankfully not too sweet and with a bassy bottom note almost like Italian roast coffee. In an age of brands committing suicide by cutting quality, Samuel Smith's has kept on providing one of the best beers out there, even if a bit pricy."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.74,Incredible chocolate flavor. This is how a chocolate milkshake would taste if it were a beer. Great body and not overly cloying. Definitely worth a try.
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.37,I wish it came in a can
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.63,"Phenominal beer. The texture is unbeatable in how bold and full bodied it is. Flavor actually retains some chocolate so it's not just in the name, smells like it too."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.3,"Black to dark brown body. Quick flash of a brief, short beige head. Highly carbonated and tasty. A nice sipper, a bit of chocolate and smooth malts. The barley is more discernible than the chocolate, to make it clear where the focus is here. But it's well done. Usually when a beer gets to its last few sips it becomes less bearable, but all throughout this beer is of very solid quality and retains good flavor."
Organic Chocolate Stout,3.82,"Had this from a bottle.
A: pours a dark brown body with no real head; small lacing
S: smells like sweet tootsie roll pop; pretty good overall
T: sweet, chocolate milk tasting beer; milk chocolate tasting with a subtle, dry chocolate finish
M: medium body and pretty smooth; slightly filling
D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking sweet stout"
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.25,"Bottle poured into a nonic

Brewers Notes: Brewed with well water (the original well, sunk in 1758, is still in use with the hard water is drawn from 85 feet underground), the gently roasted organic chocolate malt and real organic cocoa used in this ale impart a delicious, smooth and creamy character, with inviting deep flavours and a delightful finish - this is the perfect marriage of satisfying stout and luxurious chocolate that will lead to smiles and refills. Samuel Smith's brews in traditional coppers, uses stone 'Yorkshire Squares' for fermentation, and ships every bottle from the brewery with great pride.

Dark cola brown liquid topped by a two finger creamy taupe crown

Aroma is sweet milk chocolate

Taste is sweet milk chocolate with faint roast malts

Sweet, low sudsing , smooth

Good beer"
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.04,"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint Glass

The beer pours completely pitch black with about two fingers of khaki/tan head that slowly recedes leaving behind a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is overpoweringly chocolate! Once you get past the initial punch of chocolate there are notes of vanilla and roasted malt

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The milk chocolate is complimented with some notes of roasted malt. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and vanilla. Medium/full bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, even if they are a little heavy handed with the sweet chocolate"
Organic Chocolate Stout,5,"Look: Poured from a pint bottle refrigerated temperature - Extremely dark brown pour with strong notes. Can tell it's brown by holding it up to the light and seeing the hints of brown that seeps within this one. About a inch of foam risen to the surface.
Smell: Getting a strong metallic smell as if I opened a Guinness. Maybe it's the way the Irish brew their beers? Noticed this on quite a few Irish stouts before. Especially Guinness. Got hints of metallic, chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end.
Taste: Wow!!!! Got huge notes of chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end. Initial contact was chocolate and the end flavor was the cocoa. Very good!!!!
Feel: Medium bodied beer - Silky smooth chocolaty rich and very delicious.
Overall: I'm going to say this is the BEST chocolate stout I've ever tasted and if you see this in the store - well it's your lucky day if you decide to buy it. I'm going to buy it in bulk tomorrow."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.3,"2/7/22 strong chocolate aroma. Tan, creamy long standing head. Low ABV at 5%. Smooth, malty, dark chocolate taste. Not too sweet. Just a bit more thin bodied than I expected. Would do again."
Organic Chocolate Stout,3.87,"A little too chocolate-sweet for me, but otherwise good."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.65,"Samuel Smith never disappoints and this is one of my all time favorites. I don't ever know where to begin other than make sure you grab one of these and experience ""The Best"" Chocolate stout there is."
Organic Chocolate Stout,3.88,"1/29/22 The color is strong black coffee, thin tan head is persistent; First sip leaves a thick lace that slides down the glass, leaving it's lacy trail. as the glass empties, the lace becomes dramatic; ; it's a mild stout, but not too mild, much better than my recollection of Guinness; As I was tasting the mouthfeel reminded me that this is an English stout. my taste buds must adjust if I am to enjoy the four-pack. and lo the flavor doth improve as the level falls in the glass."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4,"I wasn't mindblown but I did get the extra chocolate taste, it just blends into the base beer and comes of more subtly at first. I can see how this beer has been influential."
Organic Chocolate Stout,5,"Delicious stout with a pleasant but not overbearing chocolate flavor. Surprisingly refreshing for a stout, not too heavy or light. Delicious from the first sip."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.49,"The chocolate smell is so wonderful! The flavor is chocolate goodness as well, but not quite as much as the smell. The flavor is slightly less chocolate, and has the malty goodness of a stout. A great beer."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.75,"This is a chocolate stout to remember. Samuel Smith delivers a delicious stout that has remarkable chocolate flavor. It also contains hints of coffee and has a very good aftertaste. It’s smell is sweeter than it’s taste, but barely. This is a quality beer at its finest and it is one to tell your friends about."
Organic Chocolate Stout,4.76,"Drinking this right now and holy-hell is this stuff good. Finally a chocolate stout to hit the dot. Nothing is too overbearing, but it is very tastey."

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.83,A good old standby!
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.85,"A revolutionary beer in the craft industry and appropriately named after an American Revolution figure. This beer changed the way the beer industry crafted this fine malty beverage and in the American spirit, pushed others to strive for greatness. We are now blessed with many fantastic breweries who followed in the footsteps of this wonderfully balanced and flavored malty lager. A beer that will always satisfy and has not aged a bit since it’s introduction in 1984. On this Independence Day, lift up your glasses of Boston Lager, and continue to innovate and improve!"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.68,"Brief review from when I had this at a restaurant

Big frothy head that quickly dissipates, it has a very lovely, crystal clear amber colour.

Noble hops present in the body of the beer, pleasant bitterness backed by a predominantly caramel malt backbone. Very crisp, light-medium bodied. Loved the bitter ring on the finish, with the malty vanilla grain notes gently riding out as well.

One of the best macro offerings for sure. Had a lot of craft that was even as good as this."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.96,"Beautiful medium amber color with thin off-white head. The smell is average, with a hint of malt. The first sip is malty and bready, that turns into toffee. I am a big fan of carbonation and wouldn’t mind a little more in this brew- but it is an adequate amount which allows you to experience the transition of flavors. I typically don’t notice this much flavor movement in macro beers, but this one is prevalent and welcomed. The finish is semi-dry with nearly no bitterness. It is like drinking a full bodied beer without the full bodied fullness. I had one once before, but I was already pretty drunk and didn’t appreciate it for what it is. It’s no Coors Banquet, but it definitely is worth revisiting if you haven’t become a total beer snob! (Haha) …and who doesn’t love their commercials?! I give this a solid 4 in my humble opinion and I would not turn this down if offered. When it comes to complexity of taste- this is truly the King of the macros."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.69,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a quarter finger off-white head on an aggressive pour that fades down to a bubble film that stays throughout the drink. Medium amber brown color. Clear with no haziness. Medium lacing on the glass.

S - Malts up front with a bread or cracker scent. Some mild toastiness. Some mild earthy tones as well.

T - Caramel Malts are front and center. Light toastiness on the back end. Some sweetness in there. Minimal hop flavors with almost no bitterness.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some frothiness. Medium carbonation.

O - Overall, this is a solid malt-forward beer. Sam Adams Boston Lager has been a standard beer for me for many years. It’s one of the better all-around beers for someone who is not a hop-head. Great smooth malt flavors. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to all."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.77,"Look - color is somewhat copper and pretty clear. Head was about 1 finger size and dissipated quickly.

Smell - A little malty with hints of toffee and vanilla.

Taste - The taste surprised me because the hops are more present than I expected based on the smell. It was a nice surprise and gave good depth to the beer.

Feel - Good, standard lager with moderate carbonation.

Overall--a good, but not fancy beer. It seems like a pretty safe choice and should appeal to a lot of people, but doesn't have the complexity of so many of the craft beers out there. Still, probably my favorite macro lager that is available most places."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,2.88,"An okay beer, the problem is, it's never my choice but something that's forced upon me via variety packs."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.62,"A nice looking crystal clear, cooper body with a thick head. Not very intense but pleasant aroma, fragrant grain & floral hops. Very mild hop bitterness with a dry finish. Crisp, clean taste: malty goodness with bread & spice. Average viscosity for a lager. Nothing special but still very good."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.87,"My favorite, because it allow me drink a great beer everywhere. I have tried others as good but all are locals this one is in all US. Best comercial beer so far."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.46,"Pours a translucent copper/burnt orange color, with a fast receding foamy whit head. Smell mild hints of toffee and vanilla. Taste is bready,malty and nicely hopped. This is a tasty beer.Feels almost thin bodied,finishes semi dry. Overall this in my opinion is a different brew than 35 years ago when they were trying to make a name for themselves. This was my go to beer and if I moved to another State that did not stock it , I would tell the owners how fantastic this beer was. ( I may as well have worked for them) it was the best beer, (also Anchor Steam) at the time in the US market- This seems like a cheapened version on every level of ingredients. It was a beer I would have rated a 4.5. This on the other hand shows what mass production can do to quality of ingredients. Last time I drank this ,SAM Adams was trying to impress, now they are a small conglomerate who makes mediocre beer. Sad that success destroys the product-"
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,4.16,Only pick this beer up when it's very fresh. I wouldn't even recommend picking this up if it still has 2 months left on it's freshness labeling. Big fluffy head that lasts throughout the beer. Well balanced malt and hop flavors. I swear this beer used to be under 5%. Either way it's miles ahead of the majority of craft attempts.
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.58,"Dad's go to, so became the first beer I familiarised myself with."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.38,"This is a beer that I could drink over an hour or 45mins. It has a nice color to it, and a crisp flavor that hits your tongue right away. Had a dry feel to it with some bitterness at the sides of your mouth. You can definitely taste the hops, leaving it more honestly bitter than I expected and some spice notes with that. The IBU rating will deceive you. It taste like an inoffensive beer with a strong hop flavor. Was excited to try this and it disappointed. Not bad."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.66,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (beers for cheers)
The look is a nice solid to light amber with average carbonation. Head on the pour isnt spectacular, but what does form sticks around for a while. Crystal clear

Hops are very present on the nose, but almost all bittering hops. Very classic hop scent blending very well into the malt backbone. Very pleasant scent. Herbal earthy and malty.

Taste almost resembles a pale ale. Hops largely overpower any lager characteristic, much unlike their winter lager. Still easy to put down and inoffensive but much more bitter than most lagers I've had despite the claim of 30 IBU on the bottle. Wish the malt was stronger on the taste. It does come through in the after taste though.

Feel is like most lagers easy to put down not too heavy and pretty refreshing the strong hops detract from refreshing as much but that's not a huge deal it came in a winter pack.

Overall a pretty good hoppy lager. Choppier than a traditional pils, but nothing crazy. Flavors are all ones you've had before, but maybe not in a lager. Pretty good definitely better than most macros flavor wise but maybe not refreshing wise."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.98,"Pours clear amber gold with white head. Light malty, grassy smell. Bready, hoppy, taste with some bitterness at end. Smooth, easy drinking."
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,5,My favorite beer. Very balanced with just enough hops and a very slight sweetness
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,3.77,"Dark copper colored with a quarter inch of beige head on top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark, bready malt and a touch of grassy hops. I’m tasting caramel and marzipan with a touch of grassy hops in the fade. The mouth is crisp and refreshing."
Kellerweis,3.87,"I think their label got it right on the nose ""Our Bavarian-style wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove. This hazy-golden beer glows with suspended yeast, creating a velvety texture and refreshing finish."" This is one of the few beers where the label is spot on. Very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on, as well as the very smooth finish."
Kellerweis,3,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. I turned the bottle upside down before opening. Hazy yellow colour, small white head of poor retention. The aroma has notes of citrus, and less pronounced notes of cloves and banana. There are also some less pleasant hints of solvent. The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel.

Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent. The aroma and flavour have some of the typical notes of a hefeweizen (banana and cloves), but this beer was far from the best h.w. I’ve had (and I love hefeweizens). Fizzy mouthfeel."

The aroma is the wheat banana. The aroma is not over powering, but it is noticeable while preparing for the sip.
The taste follows the nose, banana wheat flavors, the cloves are very faint. There are just enough hops to tame the sweetness on the finish.
The feel is a nice smooth,creamy mouthful.
I like the taste of this beer, the feel is very good, the cloves are maybe just a bit faint, but overall, very good."

M: Body is medium to low. Carbonation is medium to low. Alcohol is unnoticeable. Sweetness is mild.
O: Wasn't expecting this to be this good."
Kellerweis,3.9,"L: Slightly hazy golden color, two finger white head, nice lacing, goof carbonation.

S: Wheat, hops, banana.

T: Wheat, hops, banana.

F: Light bodied, extremely drinkable.

O: A pretty good weissbier."
Kellerweis,3.75,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; bottled on 09/25/18.
A: Pours a nearly clear, straw to golden color with a one finger, white head, fairly modest retention for the style, and spotty lacing.
S: Tangy/tart upfront, but mostly the light aromas of banana, cloves, and maybe caramel or toast.
T: Semisweet to semidry. Flavors are equally light versions of the nose. Low bitterness and little aftertaste.
M: Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.
O: Drinkable and enjoyable. I've had quite a few Bavarian-style Wheat Ales and this is not on a par with those."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Looks dark brown almost black with a nice foamy tannish head.
Smells malty, sweet, chocolate, coffee.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a nice stout that I would definitely drink again."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.99,"RBESG 2006 Grand Tasting. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Very nice roasty and hoppy aroma, some sweetish bakery notes in the background. Nice roasty flavour, not overdone, notes of good coffee, hints of dark chocolate. A very good stout in my book."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.4,"On tap at Rogue in Newport. The color is opaque black, with a nitro head and huge frothy bubbles that are retained on a solid crown. The smell is super oaty, sweet, mollasses, cream, and dark rich malt, not much toast. The taste betrays the smell with licorice and rich oats up front, shifting into sarsparilla and rich toasted malt, finishing on a lingering hop notes and mollasses sweetness. Finish wise this is a dry stout for me, and the mouthfeel is thin for a typical stout and finishes moderately dry, which i find interesting.

This is a great oatmeal stout that stands out different from others that rely on heavy cloying sweetness so often. Great job!"
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.1,"A- This one pours a very dark brown color and is fairly hard to see through, but some light does pass. The head is rich and creamy, about two fingers in thickness initially and settles fast into a thick layer of foam above the brew itself. Carbonation appears to be about average for the style, while the lacing is tan colored, with very little in terms of cling around the inside of the glass. Decent looking overall

S- Lots of cocoa initially, which gives way to a slightly soapy tang. Underlying notes of black coffee, grassy/grainy oat flake, dark fruit remnants, dark chocolate nougat malt sweetness, and dare I say a piney quality that reminds me of the outdoors....interesting!

T- There is some citrus peel zest, piney resin and overall this isn't good for the style. Unfortunately, it overtakes the chocolate/coffee/char that I was hoping for. As for the more traditional flavors, they are there, but are all over the place, and are more noted on the finish than rather in the middle of the taste. There is a weird lingering aftertaste that is more of hops than anything. The oat dryness is present and I think this is enhancing what I am not liking about the flavors here, which is unfortunate, as I normally like a good Oatmeal Stout.

M/O- Medium bodied and the carbonation is fairly robust too, providing more of a pale ale vibe than anything. Drinkability is poor for this reason and overall this falls short in what I was expecting this to be. Rogue is generally a favored brewery with its offerings in my opinion, but this is about as interesting and enjoyable as a Shakespearean play. Not good."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a stout glass.

Pours a very dark-brown (nearly black) opaque with a creamy dark tan head that lingers for the last finger, giving way to exceptional foam and lacing.

Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roasted malts, and dark fruits.

The brew hits the tip of the tongue with bittersweet chocolate and hints of coffee and roasted grain. And then---the main event arrives in midstream. BIg oat flavor rises above the din, with the grainy oats blending with some subtle but solid dark fruit flavor. Deceptively hidden grassy and earthy hops augment the coffee and chocolate bitterness and bring it all home.

The brew is just shy of full-bodied, with the grainy oats providing a drying finish. Very drinkable for the style.

Exceptional representation of the style."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.09,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Pitch black, no light passes.

Nice khaki head which dissipates but doesn't disappear.

Strong lacing.

Mild cocoa nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Oats kick in with the taste; hops are clearly present as well.

A lot going on here; the oats & hops mixing creates an odd metallic effect on my tongue. For all that it's really drinkable and certainly unique."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,3.88,"If you like dry oatmeal stouts, you'll like this one. Rogue makes good stuff, but I expected just a bit more here. It's very oatmeal-heavy, with just a bit of creaminess but not as much as I'd have thought, and a bit of smokiness as well. Yes, it's very dry."
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4.36,"(12 oz bottle, 19559... poured into a nonic)

L: relatively high-rise dark tan foam stand on pour; collapses slow, holding a tight, creamy construct; dark brown liquid, reddish highlights... chunky collar and dark tone to foam remains; a few nice wide bands of lace

S: dark chocolate milk, chocolate cake; subtle toasty-roasty and char notes; earthy, woodsy/piney background hop essence... shows a lil old leather as it goes

T: smooth roasted barley wash up front, cakey malt middle, hint of dark coffee in the finish; big robust piney bitter afterburn humming with the charred roast in the aftertaste; back end is relatively dry - majority of sugars express burnt caramelization... roast and bitter last a long time; delicate toffee-ish sweetness builds

F: the bitterness, roast, and ample carbonation fray the ends, balancing out the husky milkiness of its body... alcohol plays real light... feels like a meal unto itself; soft oily, resinous residual film

O: takes me back!... this used to be a regular (bomber-size) swill of mine back in the early aughts - moved on to other breweries, styles... don't see this too often anymore; happened to find this at State Line, thought I'd take a trip down fuzzy-memory lane (1403)"
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,4,"From Labirratorium. In Teku glass. Playing Khimera. Dry and bitter,with soft roastyness and some chocolate and coffee notes.Nice but I expected more smooth and creamy body and stronger flavors"
Fantôme Saison,4.49,"I am so happy I finally got to have this beer! Wonderful beer! So smooth and full bodied. Funky and sweet, great taste! Nice hoppy bitterness. Lemony and spicy. Poured from a bottle into a tumbler. Beautiful foamy, creamy head atop a hazy golden yellow body. Excellent curtain lacing. Hope to get more!"
Fantôme Saison,4.28,"750ml green bottle. Corked and capped.
Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. Lots of pillowy white head; it takes a few pours to get a full glass. Keeps the foam as the beer is consumed.
Aroma is clear with Belgian yeast, with green apple and citrus.
Taste is similar to a champagne but with more yeast (slightly sour, but in a good way). Citrus and pear. Long fade out in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel with some effervescence. Hints at dryness, but this is from the yeast. Very expressive carbonation.
Thirst quenching, and has that yeast bite. Yummy."
Fantôme Saison,4.31,"750 ml bottle poured into a tulip

A- A hazy golden copper with a large fluffy white head.

T- Funky, musty, pears, some wheat, hints of apricots, cloves, earthy spices, touch of lemon zest.

M- Smooth, lively carbonation, light body.

O- Best Fantôme bottle I’ve gotten so far, taste doesn’t live up to the nose but still a great saison that gets better as you drink it."
Fantôme Saison,4.75,Awesome. Very tasty!
Fantôme Saison,4.42,"750 ml bottle.

Pours a hazy golden color with a significant off-white head. Leaves beautiful cobwebs of lacing along the glass.

Strong aromas of hay, musty oak, and lemon zest. Some very light coriander and apricot. Lightly skunked.

The flavor has notes of coriander, white wine grapes, bubblegum, mint, and lots of apricot and pear. There's also some lemon, honey, ground cinnamon, clove and apple slices with a bit of cracked pepper. Moderately hoppy on the finish. Grassy and herbal throughout. A lot going on here.

The feel is medium bodied with nice, bubbly carbonation. Wonderfully crisp with an incredibly smooth finish. You wouldn't know this beer is 8% if you didn't read the bottle.

So this has been a beer I've wanted to get my hands on for years. As soon as I popped the cork I got a tidal wave of skunk in my face. Naturally, I feared the worst. The aroma itself is good, but the flavor is just indescribable. There's just so much complexity. It perfectly straddles the line between balanced and muddled. Everything just works somehow and I love it."
Fantôme Saison,4.06,"Pours a golden with very limited haze. Some white head. Some lemon, some pear. Maybe some dried apricot on the nose. It's got some of the green bottle skunkyness, but not a lot. The main flavor, and I'm not sure I can put wrap my head around it fully, but is kind of got an overripe basil flavor to it. Maybe some bitter green arugala/kale character as well as some minty spearment gum character as well. It's incredibly complex. I enjoyed this."
Fantôme Saison,4.39,"Pure gold body, hazy due to being unfiltered, and with yeast sediment; vigorous effervescence rapidly forms a huge, fine white head with good retention, it forms right back up with a swirl.
Fresh sweet apples, and the orchard they came from, hints of coriander, grapefruit zest, lightly floral, honey, even touches of bubblegum. It's not a particularly strong aroma, but it is interesting.
The flavour is like running through meadows and orchards - honey, apples and pears, wheat grain and hay, balanced perfectly by a spice from both yeast and hops, and a deft hop bitterness and dry finish. Champagne-like carbonation and almost buttery texture give it a luxurious, sophisticated feel.

This is irresistible. Can't stop taking sip after sip, seeking and finding something new each time. A symphony, with highs and lows, balanced beautifully. Must try."
Fantôme Saison,4.41,"Just recently discovered that one of my favorite beers, Spotted Cow, was considered to be a Farmhouse Ale - Saison so I have gone on a search for saisons available in my area. Came across this one my local bottle shop. Honestly it is one of the best most drinkable beers I have come across in sometimes. The smell of this beer made me concern but the taste of the beer proved to be exceptional. If you like drinkable beers and enjoy cinnamon / cloves then this beer is for you. As an added bonus the feel of this beer is magnificent silky and bubbly at the same time. Kudos to brewers."
Fantôme Saison,3.73,"750 ml capped and corked green bottle, as Fantôme bière artisanale sur lie, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8%. Hazy deep golden colour, huge white head. Pleasant aroma of spicy yeast, citrus and oxidised apples. Distinctly spicy flavour, some citrus and medium bitter hops in the finish. I’m upping it a couple points. Original rating: Shared bottle at local tasting. Hazy pale yellow colour. Slightly lemony and mildly spicy aroma. Refreshing flavour, moderately lemony and mildly spicy again. Light bodied. Low bitterness."
Fantôme Saison,4.03,"I really wasn’t sure what to expect out of this one because it’s a biggie. I mean, it’s not gonna knock Raul out, but it’s a well respected one. It’s kind of like going to the flop house and getting the madame; I’m excited, but I’m also a lil nervous. But then after brother Raul took a sip, nervous he was not. It’s just straight up clean and smooth. That’s it. This dove did not have BO!

Peace!"
Fantôme Saison,3.96,"Small pour at Alefort. Cloudy, milky yellow, with a small bubbly head. Grassy aroma, lemons, floral. Taste reflects this with the addition of sourdough, yeast. Pretty full , complex."
Fantôme Saison,4.25,"The house yeast that, then, turns dry. Different, but gives Fantome its zesty panache’ and authentic farmhouse touch.

Given how there seem to be consistency issues, I'm glad I Had this Saison on tap from The Beer Temple. The hazy yellow and inch of foam was fine but only mildly intriguing. Smells tell a different story, very fruity; mostly apples, but citrus in the background. How the yeast is working those malts sweetly is in the immediate attack, but then the spicing (yeasty pepper and hops) take over. Finishes dry, perhaps a bit too dry to let a good meal show its stuff also. But, that is part of the Fantome Panache to me."
Fantôme Saison,4.38,"Pours a clear, deep golden coloration with an amber hue, large, fluffy, stable head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy malt and strong fruity and slightly spicy yeast esters, with notes of green apple, pear, apricot, gooseberry, lime peel, clove and black pepper. Taste follows the nose, with some sweet'ish doughy, slightly grainy malt upfront, but being absolutely dominated by the quite complex and fruity yeast esters, with lighter spicy notes also coming through, as well as a very mellow tartness and just the merest hint of musty funk and a surprising bitterness in the finish, with notes of tart green apples, sweet pears, juicy apricots, tangy gooseberries, zesty lime peel, clove, black pepper and just a hint of star anise. Finishes with a light/medium bitterness and some fruity/spicy yeast esters lingering in the aftertaste. Sparkling, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and strong carbonation.

While this is not quite what I imagined, it's still an excellent Saison that is a lot more tradtional and less funky than I expected though. However, there really is a marvellous depth and balance to the estery flavor profile here that is rather impressive, with quite vibrant fruity and spicy notes as well as a mild malt sweetness."
ApriHop,2.38,"The hops drown out any apricot flavor
This stuff is horrible."
ApriHop,4.71,"One of my favorite beers ever, the dark, almost caramel flavor of the apricot is a much better compliment to the IPA style that you might think. A perfectly balanced beer and a great pickup if you can find it."
ApriHop,4.16,"The appearance was always a nice amber to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace to a semi-filmy lacing. The aroma, woah, absolutely freakin’ awesomely apricot to peachy goodness filling a super nice semi-bitter piney hoppiness running about the nose. The taste was mostly bitter but lead to a nice semi-sweet citrus-ness concerning itself to try to run itself about a nice aftertaste and ended up leading to a fairly same finish. On the palate, this one shows a nice sessionable quality running about it and still lends a hand to a nice carbonation running about its body and shows that there is nothing overbearing of the sorts on any end. Overall, good fruit beer that shows a decent bitter hoppiness trying to make it come across as an AIPA."

Le Terroir,4.43,"While I've had 73 ales in this style, I understate the situation and say that I am no fan for Wilds. Of the first 200 Wilds listed by their number of ratings, I've had 22 and only 1 did I rate above the average.

Le Terroir is the second.

Since I am such a sour-puss, I should like sour ales. Only rarely is that pairing made.

But this review is supposed to be about Le Terroir. It Looks better than the competition who often look confused and few are foamy. Terroir Smells like tart fruit. And it Tastes that way; yet its sweet and sour combo has this rare drying sensation that continues. Best yet, it does not interfere with my meal of soup and spinach. Too many Wilds overpower. Terroir stays within itself and treats food as a friend.

I suppose that comes from hiring Rodenbach's brewmaster and the mark he left.
I've made my micro-review of New Belgium elsewhere and admire the founders who cut their workers into the deal who, in turn, sold the company to a big brand manager. I hope they made the right decision and the creativity of Le Terroir continues.

This is my second addition to purposefully climbing Beer of Fame, now @ 163. A Votre Sante' !"

Negra Modelo,3.27,"This is my go-to drink but while it has a good molasses and honey dark beer flavor, it is still too bloody sweet to enjoy on a regular basis. For that reason, I tend to mix this with a light IPA for a primitive black 'n tan, but if you go to some random bar or pub it is a good beer to order that will not make you ill and if nothing else tastes too much like the chocolate chip cream cake you got for desert."
Negra Modelo,3.24,"Bottled Negra Modelo (Constellation) tasted at a Long Island bar/restaurant in August, 2022. I chose this beer as an alternative to the many high alcohol draft options I faced. This oscura beer is a fairly straightforward example of a generic dark lager. It has a brown body topped by a tan head. The pleasant taste features some caramel or roasted malt and just a hint of bitterness. Drinkable but unexciting dark beer option."
Negra Modelo,2.88,"On tap at Fiesta Mexicana, Mrytle Beach, into a giant mug, maybe 28oz?

Translucent dark brown. Little to no head or lacing.

Negra Modelo,3.34,"A pint glass with a centimeter of tan fizzy head was served to me a Tacos and Tequila. Very dark amber color, clear with red highlights. The scant head dissipated quickly leaving no lacing behind.

Dark bready smell with alcohol and faint bitter hops.

Neutral taste with average bitterness. Faint caramel malt adds no sweetness, some roasted character and astringent alcohol. Faint indistinguishable hops. Fast drying finish with that alcohol astringency lingering on with roasted bitterness.

Medium light bodied with average carbonation. Adjuncts (mostly corn) are hidden behind the booze. Not very balanced for the style."
Negra Modelo,4.51,"I enjoyed the taste, and when vacationing in Mexico, it was the closest I could find to my stout of choice."

S - Corn, wheat, and slight ethanol.
T - Corn is present, but shadowed by dark bread notes. Toasty. Balanced.
F - Medium-light bodied, with medium carbonation. Refreshing. Super drinkable.
O - Surprisingly good. I've had it before, and I'll end up getting it sometime again in the future."
Negra Modelo,3.31,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by Nov 2022

On the pour a 2 finger head forms, which gradually recedes to a thin covering over the top of the beer. Color is a dark brown/copper to amber. Very lively carbonation. Some lacing tries to form but not the best.

Aroma is mostly oxidized lager yeast with some extra malts in from traditional modelo. Some dark notes but no real malt sweetness comes through. Maybe some very very light mexican hops similar to corona but less light struck. Not a lot here.

Taste is more complex than the aroma. Lager feel right at the front of the sip with a slow evolution to a fuller bodied malty flavor with very fleeting and light bitterness. Not really a bitter beer, but not completely hopless. Aftertaste is subtle dark toffee malt, still penetrated by some mexican lager yeast flavors and it slowly fades out to a more bready note.

Feel is light for the style but not a watery beer. Head still gives a good amount of mouthfeel but it's on the lighter side of things. Similar to modelo maybe a bit bigger.

Overall for the brand a decent dark lager but for the style a bit disappointing and overridden by generic lager flavors, especially when drinking from the bottle. Not a bad beer by any means but not a great example of a Dunkel. It was my Cinco de mayo beer since I wanted something more than generic Mexican mass market lager."
Negra Modelo,3.37,"On tap at Rey Azteca served into a large mug

The beer pours a clear dark copper/amber color with a large off white foamy head that recedes slowly leaving behind no lacing

The nose is mild with bready, caramel and toffee notes, and hints of chocolate. Lightly sweet with a faint fruitiness.

Like the nose, the taste is clean and bready, with bits of caramel. Fairly mild and medium/light boded with soda-esque carbonation.

Overall, a nice little beer that is at the crossroads between being a Euro style dark lager and a Dunkel"
Negra Modelo,3.7,"12oz bottle BB SEP 2002 poured into a shaker pint at fridge temp 5.4% ABV per label. The beer pours mostly bright light brown with dark khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles and lasts. The aroma is very slight with notes of cocoa and grain. The taste is bittersweet with more cocoa, pale malt and a hint of corn. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, good beer, but not fair to score it as a Dunkel."
Negra Modelo,3.44,"For a budget beer, fantastic! Not too bubbly, nice notes of rye, caramel, smoke, and nuttiness. Nose smells like wet wonderbread. Goes great with food, with a slice of limón, or prepared michelada style."
Negra Modelo,3.42,"355 mL bottle from a six-pack bought at the LCBO; dated Nov 26 2021 and served barely chilled. One of a dwindling number of widespread macro lagers that I haven't gotten around to reviewing for one reason or another.

Pours a clear copper-amber colour with some effervescence; gathered atop is an inch of soapy, lumpy, cream-coloured head that dissipates within a couple of minutes. It leaves behind a messy coat of lacing, in addition to a sudsy collar and filmy cap - looks good to me. Subtle aroma of caramelized sugars, with toasted grains and bread; maybe a teensy bit of nuttiness and some metallicity.

It's a serviceable dark lager: a little sweet, but nothing unusual for the style. Toasted grains and lightly caramelized sugars, with doughy sweetness on the back end; just a hint of grassy, herbal hop bitterness on the back end for balance. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and nutty, fading within a moment or so. Medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation that gently prickles the tongue; smooth mouthfeel, not much bite. Fantastic drinkability - I don't tend to consume dark lagers in large quantities, but six of these around a campfire wouldn't present much of an obstacle.

Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. For a Euro-style dark lager, Negra Modelo is average at best - but I can't rightly claim that it was unpalatable, or that there was anything especially wrong with it. If anything, it's one of the better macro lagers I've had in recent years, and easily the best Mexican macro I've tried to date. The main downsides (at least here in Ontario) are the format and price point - in fact, my unwillingness to pay $14-16 for six bottles of macro lager is the biggest reason I've avoided reviewing this until now. I still don't think it's worth that, but the beer itself is nice enough, and worth the tick."
Negra Modelo,3.43,"Appearance: golden/caramel/brown

Total: I like this beer sometimes. While it is a bit on the watered side, it seems built for hot weather."
Negra Modelo,3.75,"Bottle served with a lime at fiesta Mexican a in moab , utah

Notes: Negra Modelo, better known as ""the cream of the beer"", is a Munich-type beer with 5.3º of alcohol that offers a balanced flavor and a delicate aroma of dark malt, caramel and hops.

Today it occupies the first place in sales among dark beers in Mexico. This beer is accompanied by a bright deep amber color, which is adorned with abundant, white and compact foam.

Negra Modelo was introduced in Mexico in 1925 as the dark beer called Modelo, to begin its great tradition. In 2014 it changed its image to a more sophisticated bottle but with the same content.

Ingredients - Water, barley malt, non-malted cereals, hops

Goes well with Mexican food, malty , fresh clean,

Good beer"
Negra Modelo,3.75,"Easily my most favorite massed produced beer. If they have only basic beers, I happily reach for this."
Negra Modelo,3.8,"Overall:

People rating this in terms of depth and complexity are missing the point. This is right up there with Yuengling as a widely available, cheap, and easily down-able beer to go with food or just to kill several of without hurting your wallet. Great for the price, solid Vienna lager with macro-availability, easy go to choice when there are limited options."
Pure Hoppiness,3.93,Canned 5/11/21.
Pure Hoppiness,4.25,"I get a lot of herby hops and just a little bready sweetness.

Bitterness and an herbal dankness dominate an extremely clean taste that only has a slight hint of malt.

It's really thin and has medium carbonation.  The finishish is dry, bitter and quick... like John Oliver's wit.

Overall it's a delightful, clean and interesting IPA that I give a 5.1 out of 6."
Pure Hoppiness,4.33,"Poured out a clear golden amber with a barely sustainable head.
Fresh citrus with orange peel, some dank hop notes.
Pucker upon first sip, resin and a biting hop flavor. Lemon and grapefruit rind.
Nice bitterness and okay carbonation.
Great hop experience with this one."
Pure Hoppiness,4.21,"This is a big, classic West Coast double IPA and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. Juicy, piney, and full bodied while achieving a dry finish.

Smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow.

On the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with.

It’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.

I loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:

By: Tracy Hensley lJudges Rating:

Overall Impression:
18 / 20

A consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“"
Pure Hoppiness,3.88,"[Original rating 2015-11-19] Bottle. Pours clear dark gold with a thin white head. Aroma is a little citrus, alcohol, grass, malt. Taste is super hoppy, resiny, bitter but with just enough malt to balance it out. Nice thick mouth feel."
Pure Hoppiness,5,"One of my favorites, follows closely behind Alpine's Duet!"
Pure Hoppiness,3.75,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. No freshness date.

L: Nearly clear light golden amber pour. Fluffy white head leaves solid lacing.

S: Pine and caramel malts. Sweet and hoppy.

T/F: Malts up front... caramel and toasted grains. Pine and citrus rind hop profile. A bit of spice. West Coast style... good bitterness for balance. Medium bodied... sticky on the tongue.

O: A decent West Coast DIPA... may not have been at its freshest, so could be even better right out of the gate. One I'd enjoy having again."
Pure Hoppiness,4.34,"Not sure how fresh this is, as it was on the discount shelf. Pours a clear amber honey with a thick white head that recedes to a thin cap and leaves great lacing. Aroma is orange rind and pine. Flavor is sweet citrusy fruits followed by a bitter pine with some caramel malts in the mix. Feel is a bit heavy but overall a very nice brew. I'd like to try this fresh and/or on tap."
Pure Hoppiness,4.5,pours golden. The smell is citrusy and hops. The taste is how it smells. The feel is crisp and clean. Doesn't feel like 8%. Very refreshing beer.
Pure Hoppiness,4.19,Poured a deep gold leaning toward orange rather than amber. Aroma hits you with exactly what the name told you to expect. Hops hops and more hops. Lota of pine and citrus scents with an inderlyings carmelly malt. The taste is very deep pine with orange rind bitterness. The hop lovers dream beer.
Smooth,4.42,Pours an amber orange with white head. Aroma of oranges and grapes. Hits you with a sour pucker that fades. Lots of orange nectarine with vinous notes. Very well done.
Smooth,4.19,"Look - clear golden with great rimming
Smell - tart yeasty grain
Taste - fantastic nectarine tartness
Feel - light and crisp slight syrup
Overall - really nice beer"

Prima Pils,3.79,"Canned 5/23/22. Best by 11/23/22.

L: Pours a clear gold with a medium fluffy white head that thins to a sticky film. Irregular and thin lacing.

S: Bready aroma, with a bit of lemon and just a touch of dank.

T: Bread up front, followed by some earthiness. Finishes nicely; dry and slightly bitter.

F: Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.

O: Well-made, if not exceptional. The earthy/musty/dank element seems a bit out of place, but not unpleasant."
Prima Pils,4.29,"Pours a bright golden hay with a moderate head that dissipates slowly. Lacing is on the lighter side.

Lots of grassy hop notes touch the nose. There is a herbal quality there too.

The sip keeps the grassy and herbal notes going. A light grainy character sits in behind. It’s all punctuated by a crisp almost spicy finish.

Light bodied, well carbonated and very enjoyable.

This is an excellent American Pilsner. Up there with my favourites from Suarez, Live Oak and Olde Mecklenberg."
Prima Pils,4,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. This beer is often available in mix-a-six packs for $2/bottle. Says Best By 12 Apr 22; it's about 5 weeks past that date.

Look: Golden light straw color with a very small white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising up. Has the slightest chill haze.

Smell: Smells lemony, spicy, and earthy. There is a nice bready malt backbone with a good amount of sweetness too (think apple juice). I think there's a bit of skunkiness here too, and I'm okay with that. After swirling the glass, I get green bell pepper notes on the finish.

Taste: This is a very traditional German pilsner style. It's very light and slightly sweet on the palate up front, and the finish is crisp and bitter. This beer is very hoppy but it's not resiny at all; the hop character is slightly floral, but mostly citrusy and the finish is rindy / pithy without being juicy at all. A lot of spicy character also...lingering on my palate is an almost peppery, earthy flavor. There is a bit of skunkiness, but it's my own fault for not drinking and reviewing this sooner. That being said, I don't really mind it so it's all good.

Feel: Light to medium mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is appropriate. Very easy drinking.

Overall: This is renowned to be one of the better American-made Pilsners and I would say that it lives up to the hype. It's very easy to drink and fairly enjoyable without being boring. I just wish that it was easier to find this beer fresh; even though I live just outside of Philadelphia, it's not so easy to find and when you find it, it's often not so fresh. I think that's because so much of America is suffering from IPA-itis, a lot of beer stores are not having high turnover with beers like Victory Prima Pils so it tends to sit on the shelves for a while or a lot of stores have even stopped carrying it. I also with that Victory would brew their Home Grown Lager again, but that's a discussion topic for another time.

From the bottle:
A crisp yet distinct Pilsner brewed with German hops that bring vivid notes of floral and spice with citrus and lemon. This is truly brilliant, bringing nuanced complexity together with smooth, easy drinking.

Prima Pils,4.53,"I have never reviewed what is probably my most drank beer of all time so here we go…

Pours beautifully light straw color, crystal crystal clear. Vigorous pour leaves a nice big fluffy white head with good retention and some nice lacing to.

Smell is so much grass, spicy and floral hops and a bright snappy maybe grainy malt aroma.

Taste leans into the hops as well, the floral hop bite show more in the taste than nose. Grassy and cracker like and spicy hop finish.

Super super clean and easy to drink, dry and nice bitter finish. Grassy like bitterness that lingers well after the sip is gone, the dry finish enhances this aspect in a very nice way.

If you haven’t drank this beer go try it."
Prima Pils,4.15,"Drinking this at one of my favorite tap rooms, Tapped Craft and Drafts in Greenville NC.
Poured from a tap into a pint glass.
Looks golden yellow with a nice white foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap.
Smells lightly crackery, flora, grassl and sweet.
Taste follows the nose nicely.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a very nice example of a Pilsener that I would definitely order again.
Cheers!"

Prima Pils,4.22,"On tap at Brewers at Yancey Street on Charlotte.
Clear golden, two fingers head, reduces to clumpy surface island and full lacing curtains.
Grassy, lemon, peppery aromas.
Light lemony hop bite, floral, cracker, resin.
Definitely not a classic German pilsner but very enjoyable."
Prima Pils,4.06,"A - Pours a clear straw yellow with a large sturdy white head. Heavy soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is floral hops, cracker, white pepper and lemongrass.

T - The taste is crackers, toasted biscuit, sweet corn, lemon, white pepper and grassy bitter hops.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Soft mouthfeel with a nice crisp finish.

O - Really solid Pilsner."
Prima Pils,3.79,"12 oz bottle poured into pilsner glass.
A: Light straw color, crystal clear, small fluffy white head.
S: When first poured, a slight hint of sulfur. After a few minutes, cracker malt and grassy hops come through.
T: Crackery malt, grassy hops, then slight bitterness in the lingering finish.
M: Fairly light body, medium carbonation.
O: Haven't had a Pilsner in a while, been on the PA/IPA/DIPA train. Definitely a crisp change."
Prima Pils,3.27,"Labeled German Style Pilsner. Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils. That said, it is a decent American pilsner if you are looking to scratch that itch."
Prima Pils,4.08,"L: Clear pale gold, tight head
S: Citrus, crackery
T: Lime, bold floral hops, firm bitterness
F: Firm bitterness, medium carbonation"
Prima Pils,3.88,Golden color with excellent bitterness to match smooth beer flavor of grass. The overall picture of the beer is impressive where. Bitterness matches the beer
Prima Pils,3.06,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.3%. Clear golden colour, moderate to low white head. Nice aroma of floral, grassy and herbal hops, some sweetish malts in the background. Medium sweet and malty flavour, followed by distinct herbal hops. A good pilsener indeed, but some European ones are better."
Prima Pils,4.09,"From a bottle, pours a mostly clear yellow with a thin white quickly dispersing head. Pronounced aroma of floral hops and lemon. Tastes is a crisp bitter hops, plus grassy citrus (perhaps grapefruit) tang, plus, sweet malt. All this with refreshing carbonation and flavors that 'sustain'. Nice."
Prima Pils,3.55,"The beer is a crisp straw color with a good head that really lasts for a while. The malt and spicey hops are on the nose with lemon notes. On the palate, the beer is is sweet with herbal, spicey and lemon hop notes. It is well balanced. The mouth feel is fry and bubbly but the two don't mix here well. Overall, a decent pilsner but not great."
Prima Pils,4,"Pours an almost clear straw color with a short lived head and some light lacing.

Smells and tastes of bready malt and floral hops. At first sips have a mildly bitter finish. As the glass warms floral tastes come out.

Light body and medium carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel."
Prima Pils,4.29,"Single bottle from Party Town
Clear pale gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention.
Great pilsner."
Prima Pils,4.12,"12oz bottle, tulip, best by 11/23/20.

Light golden beer and a white sticky head that together just look crisp.

Sweet cracker malt, mowing sweet grass, and a whiff of sulphur.

The initial taste is corn and crackers. That sweet corn remains an undertone to very floral, sweet grassy hops that carry me through to a slightly herbal, crisp finish.

Rather a full body, but crisp with plenty of carbonation.

For some reason I had always thought this was a bohemian pilsner, probably because it’s hoppier than most German pils, which is also what makes it more to my liking."
Prima Pils,4.4,Kinda reminds me of blue moon
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4,2017
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.23,"2018 vintage - aged in rye barrels.

Pours a dirty river water brown/caramel color. Some sediment present. Decent head with a hard pour that dissipates as the beer sits.

Lot of sweetness comes through both in taste and smell - lot of caramel present.

I like Old Ales and BA stouts. Not sure I love the combination of the two with this beer. One to experience. Would I get it again? At $25 for 500 mL, probably not."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4,2014 version poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip. Cloudy gold in color. Plenty boozy at 14.44% with light syrup sweet flavor. Glad this one held on nicely in the bottle for 8 years.
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.08,"Old Stock Cellar Reserve pours brown, with no head. Rich aroma, sugary sweet, with lots of bourbon. Flavor is sweet, sugary, sharp malty flavors, and noticeable bourbon flavors, with a warm finish. Good body and feel. Overall, very rich, candy sugary flavors, with bourbon. Great to sip."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.1,"2017 Cellar Reserve, so this baby was nearly three years old when I opened it.

Pours a lovely brownish copper color with honey edges and over a finger of head. The nose is malty, bready and biscuity. The flavor follows the nose but it is more muted than I expected. No bourbon flavor was discernible. Perhaps this sat a wee bit too long.

The alcohol has certainly been tamed by the long dormancy."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.62,"2013 vintage, 14.1% abv

Pours a deep murky mahogany with a small tan head that reduces to a ring quickly, some particulate floating about

Aromas of chewy caramel malts, figs, dates, dark roast coffee, light bourbon punch. Boozy and sweet, highly intriguing

Deeply complex in flavor, this evolves throughout each sip and even in the middle of a sip. The big dark fruit presence starts it off before a huge wave of toffee, brown sugar, and molasses rush over the tongue with a bit of stinging barrel wood to back it up. The finish brings it back to that dark fruit, chewy with a chocolate like sweetness, long and contemplative, amazing

More carbonation than I would've expected, but this is a full bodied babe right here. It's heavy and finishes sweet and robust, just as a beer of this size should

Despite the less than stellar looks, this thing amazed me. So full of flavor and character, I would love for them to brew this again so I can try it fresh, as opposed to having 7 years on it. It is the oldest beer I've ever had up to this point by a long shot, but it's crazy how well this has held up. Absolutely worth the $7 price tag and I would gladly pay more, I wanna pick more up for special ocassions"
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.68,"2013 vintage -

Pours amber red with a light khaki colored foam head that eventually dissipates. Smells fruity, light and sweet, like dried fruits and bourbon. Tastes sweet upfront and ends fairly dry with notes of dried fruits, apricot, fig, prune, yellow raisin, cherry pit, red plum skin, light red grape, woody oak barrel, smooth bourbon, some marshmallowy vanilla, caramel, fruity molasses, toasty toffee, hints of chocolate, cedar, mild spice, leather, tobacco, cigar box, with earthy leafy hops. Feels medium-fuller bodied, thick, slick and smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real nice bourbon barrel aged old stock ale."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.55,"This is a truly wonderful slow sipping beer. Like good raisin bread it is heavy but so difficult not to sip more of. A great dessert.

Look: Murky dark brown with a finger thick off-white head

Aroma: raisin bread and whiskey

Taste: The flavor is sweet raisin bread, caramel, and lots of whiskey.

Body/Overall: medium to full body"
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.05,"Look: It is brown with a bit of hazing. It has a tan head with no head retention.

Smell: The initial aromas are of toffee and molasses with bourbon notes mixed in. The alcohol is noticeable in the aroma with some sherry like elements. There are very low notes of dried fruit.

Taste: The initial flavors are highlighted by bourbon mixed with molasses and toffee. The alcohol is very noticeable in the flavor. There is a background flavor from chocolate and dried fruits. It also has a slight sherry like quality to it.

Feel: It has a full body, but it is not quite chewy in texture. The alcohol is slightly hot on the palate. The carbonation is very low.

Overall, a complex array of flavors and aromas that blend well together."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.47,"2013 version, paid $19.99 for a 500mL bottle at Prost in North Hampton, NH. ABV 14.1%

Served slightly chilled in a tulip while grilling a fat steak.

L: A gentle pour gives 1 finger of taupe fizz which dissipates quickly on top of a clear tawny brown brew which displays ample carbonation.
S: It smells old. Similar to the aged oxidized sugar smell from aged madeira or dry sherry. Alcohol is fairly apparent but not unwelcome. Some notes of fresh cut oak.
T: Toasty tawny oxidized sugars, vanilla, EtOH spiciness, oaky bourbon and vanilla notes long in the finish.
F: A great balance between sugary thickness and sharp carbonation.

O: Refined and bold. A great sipper to keep me warm outside in front of the grill on this blustery winter evening. However I think it may be beyond peak age. Complexity is lacking and the sugars are thoroughly oxidized. Your mileage may vary depending how your bottle was stored and cared for. Mine was directly from the store today, so I have no insight on this point."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.54,"2013 version, 14.4% ABV, drank February, 2019.

Look - dark brown with a bit of tan head, a tiny swirl that lasted.

Smell - Bourbon and alcohol, hits you in the face right after you pop the cork out.

Taste - Bourbon and alcohol complemented with toffee, brown sugar and figs. Not bitter, more on the smoother side of things as it warms.

Feel - The slight burn kinda masked any real feel, but I'd give it a medium mouth feel.

Overall - Really nice sipper. Psyched that this beer held up so well as I've been keeping it in not the most optimal conditions over the years."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.5,2016
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.46,"A - Pours a dark reddish brown with a one finger off white head. Light amount of soapy lacing.

T - The taste is caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, plums, figs and bourbon.

M - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Soft mouthfeel with a dry finish.

O - This is a killer BBA Old Ale. This is deceptively drinkable at 14.1%. A nice slow sipper,"
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.5,"2013 reviewed in late 2018.

Pours a dark, nutty brown with half a finger of khaki fizzy head. Head is fizzy and dissipates quickly. Aroma is bourbon, char, caramel, toffee, burnt sugar and roasted, caramel, and toasted malts. It smells decidedly dark, with the bourbon hitting the nose first, and is immediately followed by complex and twisty sweet and bitter notes. It's like a SWAT team kicking down the door to aggressively deliver a hearty glass of bonded bourbon. The stage is set for a big, big flavor profile. Flavor profile is decadent, encompassing several levels. First, it hits notes of sweet caramel, toffee, molasses, and light burnt sugar before fading slowly into slightly bitter roasted, toasted, and caramel malts. Bourbon is running the mixer board, slowly cranking the bourbon from 1 at the start to 10 at the finale. It's smooth throughout the entire flavor profile. A little bit of char kisses the back of the throat and is mellowed by a soft caramel candy note. Decadent and dynamic. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a surprisingly smooth feel (although this bottle has been well aged). It slips down smoothly, with the loaded ABV tucked cleaning into bed. Overall, superb, splendid, and supreme. This drinks smooth - dangerously smooth. This bottle has aged beautifully, which is a compliment both to the quality of the beer, but also the quality of the packaging. Magnificent.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 500mL bottle."
Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Bourbon Barrels),4.46,"Pours a dark brown color. The aroma is quite nice - bourbon, brown sugar, fruits & malts. The taste is incredibly smooth and a great balance of caramel, brown sugar, malts and bourbon. The feel is medium body. Overall - really good"
Triple Citra Daydream,3.75,"A thanks goes out to the incredible woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz.can. Has a pretty, hazy orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, some mango. Taste is citrus, peaches, mango, a bit of alcohol is present. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I was expecting more."
Triple Citra Daydream,4.58,"Grabbed can at Perfect about 8 months ago. Lost/ Found in beer fridge today.
Unsure fresh, but this beer at 8 months is a monster across the board.
Gorgeous slightly orange hinted golden yellow; hazy with a creamy thick white head… which breaks down into layers of dense foam that cascade in multiple halos within glass.
Nose is citric orange; grass; melon, double bubble . Flavor mirrors with more noticeable apricot tartness and some banana like richness coming through as well.
Body is velvety smooth only lightly carbonated. Rich but not heavy or sluggish. Not for everyone but spot on in my wheel house. Seems almost hand pulled from cask. Absolutely no double digit ABV noticeable at all. Mastercrafting here.
Overall I just had to bump it up a bit the sum is even better than the amazing parts. Big bow here."
Triple Citra Daydream,4.85,"L- a bright hazy OJ

Triple Citra Daydream,4.18,"Poured a golden-orange body with two-finger head that slowly died and left a lace ring down the glass. Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer."
Triple Citra Daydream,4.79,"So first question: Is this the same as the HDHC Triple Citra Daydream Collab with EQ? Second question. Have you ever walked into a brewery right after the brewers throw hops into the boil? Well that's exactly what this beer smells like once it's poured. Light hazy gold. Thick white head. Crazy, ridiculous long lasting head and thick lacing. Really something else for a beer of this ABV. Super green hops and sweaty gym clothes followed by bubble gum, berries, mango..... Taste is more bubble gum, grapefruit, green, mango. Feel is medium carbonation. Fluffy body. Overall, a hop lover's delight."
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.52,"Man, this beer RULED when I first had it. Definitely one to drink fresh and not age. Ton of coconut and barrel. I dont hear a ton about FB these days, but this beer was great!"
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.29,"Both last snow and this in the same year, neat! Jet black body with a brown head, standard but well done. Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more. Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter. Coconut fans this one is for you!"
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.8,"Pitch black with a reddish pink brown beige head of one finger.

Bourbon, coconut, vanilla and chocolate creme. Smells like that amazing suntan lotion on the beach.

Tastes of chocolate, coconut cream, chocolate icing, bourbon, vanilla, all to perfection.

Medium light body with moderate carbonation.

I got this in Waynesville NC, and am drinking it in Redding, September 23rd, 2020. One of the best beers ever."
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.5,"Tried the 2017 which was one of the best Porters I've ever had. Great all around nose, balance, mouthfeel, flavor profile and finish. Wonderful fresh and still great a couple of years later."
Last Buffalo In The Park,1.34,"A tremendous let down. The barrel aged version of Last Snow, and just as big of a let down.

Look: Pours what looks to be light-medium bodied. That’s immediate disappointment. You’re a barrel aged porter, you should look robust and either full bodied, or the high end of medium bodied.

Nose: What’d you expect: Coconut and Barrel mostly.

Taste: Barrel Aged Coconut Water

Feel: Far too light in my mouth for what I’m looking for.

Overall: Like the other porters I’ve recently tried from Funky Buddha, I had high hopes, only to be let down. Beer Advocate has about 150 beers with a 100 rating, and this is one of them. It is not deserved. This is total swill."
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.19,"Drank 03.24.20 out of a tulip, bottle dated 2016 or 2017, properly cellared.

Hate to say I was slightly underwhelmed. A nice looking beer with a nice feel, not at think as I've come to expect from FB, but still good. Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts. And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me. So be it, my opinion. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, but given the cost, probably only if I'm gifted it some day...fat chance at that! Cheers!"
Last Buffalo In The Park,4.48,"A - Pours pitch black with a thin tan head. Good amount of soapy lacing.

Hop 15,4.03,"Slightly hazy orange amber look. Has the classic West Coast DIPA basics. Citric and piney smell, with taste of the malt sweetness. Piney resinous and grapefruit flavors linger. Thicker and sweeter feel and taste than I would like. Minimal carbonation and not overpowering bitterness. I’m a Pizza Port fan from S.D. This is a beer to pair with dinner or lunch but at 11% ABV, you’re better off doing it closer to bedtime!"
Hop 15,3.94,"September 19th, 2015 - Port's 15 Double Hop is a no frills, no thrills Double IPA. Clean and consistent, this is like the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale of DIPA's, and I love it. The color is a nice orange marmalade shade, with a generic IPA smell, and it's not even especially hoppy. But the flavor is where that brilliant familiarity lies. Balanced, good hops and a clean taste balanced on a comfortable body, this is a great beer to pair with food."
Hop 15,4.05,"From the large can, it pours a clear amber with a modest head, but leaves lacing as you enjoy it. In the nose, it is solidly hops. In the mouth, the same. It is a classic West Coast IPA."
Hop 15,4.17,"Poured on draft.

Pours a lightly hazy golden amber color with a finger of creamy white head. The head leaves some cobwebs of lacing before settling into a ghostly thin sheet.

The aroma brings loads of pineapple and grapefruit as well as some orange and honeydew melon. The pine cones through in the back.

The flavor brings grapefruit, pineapple, and caramel malts followed by a bitter, piney finish. Classic West Coast right here.

The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, yet a touch syrupy and sticky. Alcohol is definitely present.

Overall, a great DIPA that punches you in the dick with hops yet has plenty of sweet malt for balance. Would drink again."
Hop 15,4.31,"19.2 oz can from Winooski Beverage, Vermont.
Stamped on the bottom ""freshest by 12/17/2019.""
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber bronze color with a level foamy white head slowly dissipating to leave some wispy messy lace.
The aroma seemed to lead with a blend that reminded me of ""honeydew coated biscuits."" Some light dry citrus rind underneath with an ever so slight whiff of clean laundry. Some floral hops lean in further underneath.
The flavor dryly took the sweetness and met it with an ample bitterness. Mellow aftertaste of biscuit malts, floral hops, and some honeydew.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. The ABV might be high in this one but it seems like the brewer was able to combine well enough to not let the ABV ""overtake"" in any sort of way. Some smoothness running along my tongue. Carbonation felt good like a West coast styled DIPA. Finishes with some malty sweetness but slightly sticky and dry, floral hop bitterness.
Overall, not sure why people can't distinguish between West coast styled DIPA's and New England styled ones, but those of out there loving on a great West coast styled DIPA, you should seek this out."

Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch creamy white head over a fairly bright, golden body with sticky lacing. Nose of citrus, pine sap, and slight, damp bud. Taste mirrors nose with a malt character and pine bitterness throughout. Bitterness is not too much but it is surely up front and personal. Nice feel and overall, abv is not too well hidden and I won't be driving anywhere tonight. Hey, pick one up, lose your car keys, and you won't be disappointed. Cheers!"

Hop 15,4.81,"A beer-bomb that always surprises me. Resins, pine, tropical, all held well together with the bitterness that accompanies all the well balanced drink until the hops explosion in the long end where the alcohol comes out to clean and heat the throat. Wonderful"
Hop 15,4.15,"Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip.

L: Clear golden copper pour with 2 fingers of foamy white head. Great lacing.

S: Grapefruit and citrus rind. Mild pine.

T/F: Bready malts... dark sugars and a juicy tropical hop profile. Grapefruit and citrus. Notes of apricot. Floral and tropical. Medium bodied. Warming. Finish is citrus.

O: This drinks like a really nice cross between east and west coast IPAs. Flavorful and tropical with some nice piney resin mixed in. Great stuff."
Hop 15,4.46,"Pours a semi clear orange, with a thick head of soft foam.

Smell is distinctly West Coast, with huge swaths of piney resin and grape fruit running up your nose.

Taste is just uncompromising, starting with a huge whallop of bitter, piney resin, and folows that up with some great citrusy goodness.

Mouthfeel is medium, and quite sticky.

Overall, just a kick in the teeth WC IPA. Very bitter, but still balanced. Awesome."
Hop 15,4.55,"L: Hazy amber color, one finger white head, ok lacing, good carbonation.

S: Hops, grapefruit, hint of tropical fruits.

T: Very hoppy, grapefruit, citrusy. Bitter on the back end. No sign of the 11% ABV. Delicious!

F: Medium to full bodied, full flavored, refreshing, very drinkable.

O: A superb DIPA. Highly recommended."
Curmudgeon,4.12,"A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout."
Curmudgeon,3.83,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again."
Curmudgeon,4.5,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent."
Curmudgeon,4.45,16oz mason jar on tap from the Craft Beer Hop Shop
Curmudgeon,4.04,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates, served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: It develops a thin, half finger head that disappears almost immediately and leaves behind a layer of big bubbles that stay until the end. It's a murky, light brown color.

Smell: It's a sweet smell of plums, raisins, molasses and malt with a hint of alcohol in the background.

Taste: It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. There's dried fruit, molasses and brown sugar. It finishes with an earthy, oak note and some alcohol.

Mouthfeel: It's smooth, slightly oily and strong but not heavy at all with a medium body and low carbonation.

Overall: Even though it goes heavily towards the sweeter side, it's not cloying and the sweetness is not one dimensional. There's a lot of different elements to unpack and discover which makes this a really good beer."
Curmudgeon,3.99,"Burnt orange in color with a nice light tan head. Update: the 2nd 12oz bottle was much flatter, headless. Pleasant aroma of molasses, plum & alcohol. Taste is bitter sweet. Nice flavor: plum, raisin, molasses,alcohol, brown sugar, oak flavors & malt. Medium viscousity. Excellent."
Curmudgeon,3.99,"Having lived in Great Britain for 4 years, I have a taste for English and, particularly Scottish ales and stouts. This is a full bodied brew that is very smooth drinking."
Curmudgeon,4,"Draught 8oz snifter at the Brass Tap here in Baltimore. Definitely, prefer this to the ""...Better Half"", and even the Smuttynose ""Really Old Brown Dog"".

Aroma is caramel, oak, and yeast
Taste follows the nose with a big malty start intense but not overly sweet caramel, golden raisin, yeast undertones, followed by oaky dryness and subtle bitter finish
The feel is medium-to-full bodied, syrupy feel, but has a medicinal dryness as well
Overall, I did not have this beer fresh (only bought it 'aged' recently) but this a super balanced complex easy drinking sipper, I'm really glad to have found this."
Coffee Bender,3.92,Tastes as close to cold steeped coffee as I’ve had in a beer.
Coffee Bender,4.18,"The beer is a very dark brown with some garnet peeking through. Medium-sized tan head. A little lace.
Coffee aroma, some roasted malt.
Strong coffee taste, espresso. Coffee taste lingers. A little bit of chocolate, some late hoppiness.
Medium-bodied. I liked how the coffee stayed present."
Coffee Bender,4.21,"Pours a rich brown color, some ruby color around the edges. Tall khaki head falls to a nice cap. Opaque color, can't see anything going on in the body. Smell is coffee, chocolate roasted malt, some hop aroma evident. Taste follows nose with roast malt up front, cocoa and coffee in the middle with a bit of hop earthiness and bitterness. Finish sees the coffee stick around until the next sip. Feel is medium bodied, slightly creamy despite the carbonation. Finish is relatively dry. Overall, this is a good brown ale with solid coffee flavor without tasting burnt or stale. I'd revisit it again."
Coffee Bender,3.83,Sixteen ounce four pack copped from Buy Rite in South Orange. Pours a smooth brown hue with semi-moderate frothing. Noticeable aroma replete with hints of cacao nibs and molasses. Similar overall flavor profile. Not bad.
Coffee Bender,4.23,"Review 1527

I just found this beer last year, alas I have never reviewed it. This beer is tasty, I am looking forward to finally reviewing it. This beer is 44 degrees and served in a Nonic. The pour of the beer created a massive three-fingered light tan head with excellent retention. The head slowly dissipated leaving lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 20, a dark brown with mahogany hues. The beer does have some clarity to it, despite it being darker. This beer is lovely.

I get coffee, dark roasted malts, and smoke for my initial sniff. Nosing further, I detect chocolate, toffee, a hint of caramel, and some floral esters. Lastly, I sense molasses, raisins, and a touch of herbal.

The flavors in the beer are dark roasted coffee, roasted malts, Maillard, chocolate, a hint of caramel, smidge of toffee, molasses, floral, herbal, and some earthiness.

The mouthfeel is somewhat dry and a touch bitter.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-low carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.

This beer is awesome. The coffee profile is not overpowering. The coffee does not give the beer any negative effects, like burnt or over roasted flavors. The brown ale is well done with a delightful coffee addition. The beer is well made, I have enjoyed drinking these beers."
Coffee Bender,4.04,"16 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Canned on 3/24/20.

L---Darkest brown color. Medium, khaki head has good retention and left nice lacing.

S---Strong coffee and lighter roasted malts.

T---Coffee, obviously. Some caramel and something sweet and vaguely fruity/berryish.

F---Medium bodied, but thinner than expected for the rich flavor.

O---Damn fine beer. I'd get this one again."
Coffee Bender,4.12,"Foamy white head. Roasted malt and coffee aromas. Flavor is pretty much as advertised. Dry brown ale with a strong coffee note. Medium bodied. Strong carbonation. Not a whole lot to say about this one, but a solid example of a coffee beer."
Coffee Bender,4.21,"5.5% ABV makes this an easy drinker. Fresh roasted flavor and aroma are dominant. Pleasant mouthfeel and the malty backbone provides a smooth finish. As good a coffee beer, without additional flavor profiles, that I have had since Rogue’s Fresh Roast. Drank from can dated 10-13-20."
Coffee Bender,4.46,"A: Beautiful roasty coffee flair pour from the pour with Auburn highlights from backlighting. The capping is impressive, dark tan color, firm and spongy texture and build, with large cavernous pits, but holds amazingly well despite. A good collection of carbonation bubbles gather on the bottom of the chalice. Full band lacing tops off an outstanding visual, finished with a milky band coating.

S: Big wiff of freshly cracked coffee beans, earthy roast and oily fresh, with beautiful tones of of deep chocolate malts. Earthy damp forest leaves, with a touch of fresh charred firewood. The coffee grounds are as fresh as can be, late addition rather kettle boil? Milky roast of good strength that I can smell all day and will surly perk you up on any morning with some vanilla. Some warming brings out a gentle smokiness.

T: Roasty flair for flavor, fresh grounded beans, dried milky chocolate malt with a soft bitterness, earthy and well rounded and smooth. Some black cherry and plum fruitiness, sweetly dark highlights the fresh roast along with some smoky charred character on the tongue with a good hold.

M: Nice fullness, malty, thick of malt and coffee oils, softly carbonated with a milky depth. Warming smoky charred character on the tongue.

O: Smooth and beautiful drinker of fresh cracked coffee bean aroma, and some vanilla rich coffee that has support of deep rich chocolate malts. Nice smoky character and an underappreciated style that doesn't get enough recognition. The fresh roasty character only builds on to the flavor with an innovative twist that blends so well together. Let this warm up a bit to really bring out the coffee aspect. Even love the redesigned can which looks like starbucks cold coffee."
Coffee Bender,4.25,Dark in color with a light brown to tan head. Nose is similar to colas but the coffee smell comes through. The taste is straight up coffee with cocoa and vanilla. Not too bitter I assume because of the vanilla I again assume has been added. Great follow through taste!!
Coffee Bender,4.21,"*2 month old can

a: super dark brown, almost black in color. quite silky. pours a 1.5 finger tan head

s: really nice punch of roasted malts, caramel, and coffee upfront. freshly roasted coffee beans, a touch of grassy hops behind that. milk chocolate powder and a little bit of a woody note. a touch more sweet malt and coffee at the end. not too complex in the nose, but very nice if you like coffee

t: rich roasted malts and caramel upfront. a nice sweet nutty flavor followed by ground coffee. a faint kiss of sweet chocolate and just the faintest hint of sweet berries. there is a touch of earthy bitterness in here as well, which tastes like faint tea. more coffee and malt sweetness to close out along with a nice bready note

m: mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium, a touch chewy. low carbonation - i think it could use just a touch more carb

o: a really nice Coffee Brown Ale. I thought from the aroma that the coffee would dominate the rest of the flavors, but it doesn't. the sweetness and nutty flavors that you want still shine through and have a really nice harmonization with the coffee. my biggest knock is I think it could use a touch more carbonation"
Coffee Bender,4.19,"A: Pours a deep brown color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap

S: Toasted malt, coffee, caramel, dark chocolate, and a touch of earthy hops

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of toasted malt, coffee, and caramel. Picks up some dark chocolate and earthy hop notes. Finishes with lingering coffee and light caramel

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation

O: A very good brown ale that takes the coffee treatment to a high level. Super easy to drink. Definitely coffee-forward. Worth checking out"
Coffee Bender,4.46,"The pour is brown colored. The taste is big & rich coffee, roasted malt, & faint caramel. I agree, this is a fabulous brown ale. Cheers! A-"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,"375ml bottle into a tulip. 2014 vintage.

Looks okay in the glass. Dull burnt orange body, on the hazy side. Brief bubbly head, but this quickly dies out, no lacing.

No getting anything on the nose, good or bad.

On tasting, all the elements are there, a little funk, sour, faintly tart, some bitterness, underlying fruit. However, the combination is a little bias towards bitter sour.

Mouth between medium and full, finish dry sour bitterness.

Overall, had hoped for better. There was some brownish goo around the cork, so perhaps something was off?"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.79,"Displaying beautiful gradients of foggy amber under a dense khaki head that slowly settles to a persistent blanket and unevenly curled collar, I can tell this pour at the renowned Avenue Pub of New Orleans is going to be a wonderful one.

Delicious qualities of toasted sesame seed and oaky funk meet the dichotomously attractive attributes of skunky aged hops. It's just super fluffy, just as the old lady described it, developing a sort of peach-grapefruit note as I dig in. Further on, as it warms, we also detect a touch of pepper and golden raisin.

The full, fluffy yet airy body delicately glides to a semi-dry finish.

I wish I had more time and room in my stomach for a few more of these."
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.34,"A: Pours a golden orange copper color with 2 fingers of head that quickly fades down to a tight, thin cap that has remarkably good retention

S: A good bit of funk and tartness up front along with some fruity notes such as apple, pear, and white grape

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of funky tart notes, fruit, and wood. A bit of some earthy mineral qualities as well. Finishes with lingering funk, fruit, and earth

M: Medium bodied with moderate, tight carbonation

O: A classic gueuze that lives up to the name. Definitely not the most funky or tart that I’ve had, but it allows for the other qualities to shine a bit. Worth checking out if you’re into the style"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.03,"375ml bottle, 2020 on the cork, no discernible date on the label, poured into a Tilquin Gueze tumbler glass.

The beer pours a hazy copper color, amber hues with a few bubbles rising to the top of glass where a finger of off-white head rests, moderate retention with no significant lacing. The aroma is nice, pleasant funk, earthy, grassy, lightly floral with a nice berry fruit quality and some pale grain and mineral water. The flavors are nice, lots of earthy funk, grassy, floral, dry dead leaves, mild barnyard qualities, mineral water, cereal grains and a nice bright fruit quality, berries and tart pitted stone fruits. The mouthfeel is good, coating and very lively, crisp medium body that has a nice heft and a tart and dry finish.

Verdict: A nice Gueuze from Girardin. Lots of nice funk, pleasantly tart and offering a complex spectrum of flavors."
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),3.85,"Rerate, 750 ml green ""champagne"" bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Sourer and even more complex flavour than noted upon first sample. Tart finish, some bitterness. Original rating: At Copenhagen Beer Festival. Hazy golden colour, sparkling. Decent aroma of brettanomyces (sour fruit, farmhouse, horse blanket), but not extreme. The medium sour flavour has also the typical brettanomyces character, but fairly well balanced and not too extreme. Should work well as a beginner’s gueuze."
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.32,"When I popped the cork, there was a nice bit of smoke clinging around the neck of the bottle. It pours a nice apple color. Somewhat clear. 1 1/2 finger slightly off white head. The head retention is poor. The head dissipates to a nice ring around the edge of the glass, that rides up a bit on the edge. No lacing otherwise. There's some carbonation rising in the glass as I watch it.
The nose is a really wild, and complex funky aroma. There's a bit of apple here, more of an apple cider aroma. There's a farm aroma here - no not cow pies - like a straw/hay aroma. Some floral aromas here as well.
Taste - Very wild. Up front it seems more into the funky floral that I was getting on the nose. I also get some lemon flavor up front. The apple cider seems to be a back flavor that lingers.
The body reminds me of champagne - really bubbly, and crisp. Somewhat ""dry"". Crisp feeling.
I do not have much experience with this style, but I think this is a good representation for this style. I'm enjoying it."
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.23,"Orange, lightly veiled. Foam, white, good.

Citric, lemon.
Taste, very, very satisfying.

L: Uncorked with a solid pop and poured a beautiful clear orange/amber with a tall foamy white head that slowly dissolved into a thick film
S: Sort of a mild cheesy smell with hay, citrus, barnyard, a little fruit, and a dash of cider vinegar
T: Some ripe cheese with horse blanket and stable, some lemon, some apple, another fruit I couldn't identify (apricot?mango?), yeasty musty funkiness, finished with a dash of black pepper
F: dry and full, with a leathery/oaky feeling over the tongue and sliding down the throat
O: An excellent example of a gueuze. Medium body, relatively low tartness, satisfying without being filling. I'll cellar my second bottle and see how it is next year."

I slightly twisted the cork and it popped out loudly and hit the ceiling, but didn't foam over, light fizzy pink head with low retention, avoiding pouring the funk at first yields an almost crystal clear amber orange color with some light sediment

Nose brings a nice cheesy funk, plenty of bacteria souring and Brett funk, little musty wet blanket and barnyard funk, touch grassy hay, and a little fruit notes, not as complex as some of the greats

Taste brings a bit of oxidation papery notes, but plenty of wet blanket and barnyard funk, as well as the cheesy funk and souring bacteria, a little fruitiness and nice souring acidity, a touch yeasty note, oxidation gets little much, mild flemmy finish, big funk on the finish

Mouth is med to lighter bod, big acidity and a little flemmy, med foamy carb

Overall a nice beer and sour funky, not a little watery and a little oxidized, not quite as complex as the big hitters, but still tasty"

FLAVOR - bright lemon with over-ripe pineapple"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.15,"Poured from fridge temp into a Cantillon Gueuze glass. Lots of head on a typical Belgian pour (aggressive). Tons of bubbles continue to rise to the top, even when the head has disappeared. A nice transparent orange color to the beer. Nose is funk, sour cherries, horse blanket, citrus (lemon!), and some lactose/vanilla. Taste follows the nose nicely. Not too mouth-puckering. More of a subtle sourness, with a bitterness on the back end. Definitely nice notes of lemon, floral, grass, leather bitterness, funk, peaches, grapes, and some wheat. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and dry. Very good gueuze!"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.3,"Solid orange golden color with a thin head that is short lived.
Nice aroma for a Gueuze with notes of apricot, nice funkiness, white pepper and grapefruit with lemon.
Flavor with notes of grapefruit, lemon, earthy, floral and spicy hops, some wood, pleasant funkiness, mango-apricot and chardonnay wine. Dry aftertaste with an elegant sourness finish.
Light body with perfect carbonation of tiny active bubbles that becomes slightly effervescent after laying down on my tongue.
Excellent beer with good complexity. One of the most refreshing and balanced Gueuze I had, no excessive acidity and with lots of citrusy and even some tropical fruits. If I could buy where I live at the same price, I did in a large beer store near Antwerp, this would be part of my regular go-to beers."
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4.25,"It was hot here in Texas and this Geuze was very refreshing and tasty.

Look: golden slightly orange with a thick white head

Aroma: lemon, apple, some yeast/funk

Body/Overall: light to medium body"
Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label),4,"Unknown vintage; drank 8/3/19 @ the Yarchives.

Cloudy dark orange appearance.

A slow pour yielded a small, noisy white head which quickly dissipated; almost no lace.

Apple cider, tart mango, mild funk & faint black pepper notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Tart mango & funk flavors up front; mild black pepper bite on the finish.

I found the black pepper aspect a bit distracting, but overall a fine gueuze. I'd have another."
Yellow Bus,4.11,"Bottle at share, batch 2. Pale straw color looks like white wine a bit, bubbly head. Fruity aroma, grapes, stone fruit and a touch of citrus. Lots of funk here. Taste is sour, white grapes and peaches. Finishes dry."
Yellow Bus,4.68,"On-tap at The Church at Lost Abbey, their new location in downtown San Diego. What an incredible beer! Bright, vibrant, super tart, yeast character is on point. Great peach flavor. Fizzy, fresh finish. Wow!"
Yellow Bus,4.6,"On tap at The Church at Lost Abbey. Bright, sharp, clean, acid, sour, incredibly drinkable. Pours a gorgeous golden yellow, minimal head, peaches more in the nose than on the tongue. Piquant, delicious,could drink it for hours."
Yellow Bus,4.2,"Had on tap. Typical peach wild ale appearance with a amber body and a white head that settles into a collar. Aromas of peach, bright oak, and funk in a delicate nose. Taste is much the same, but would has the elevated tannin delivery. Feel is delicate and bright with light sourness and a kiss of minerality, but the is oh so light. Good and artful, but doesn't stand out in a huge way"
Yellow Bus,4,"Very nice sour beer overall. Reminds me a bit of DDG w/out the complexity. The peach flavor was somewhat muted and did not pop out as much as I had hoped, but still very enjoyable."
Yellow Bus,4.32,"750 mL bottle. 2020 bottle. Clear golden with a few bubbles. Smells of oak, basement funk, light peach. Tastes of stone fruit sourness, lots of oak, earthy and winey notes in the finish. Simple, delicious, and a blast from the past when it comes to fruited sours."
Yellow Bus,4.3,"The beautifully foggy bright yellow body darkens to maize as it gets closer to the top near the short lumpy white blanket.

Quite tart, herbal and bright of stone fruity wonderment, this is very refreshing, lightly oaky, and faintly funky.

I'm so glad FOBAB could help me check a box I never in a million years thought I would."
West Coast IPA,4.02,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this."
West Coast IPA,4.18,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. Big time piney, resinous hop aroma, some citrus, with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering, long lasting finish"
West Coast IPA,4.3,"From a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). Ok retention and lacing.

Smells of fresh cut grass and pint. Also got a hint of marijuana.

Piney, resiny, bitter taste. 95 IBUs in their glory-Right in the wheelhouse for a WCIPA. Some malts in there as well-bit of caramel.

Very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. Strong bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This is a WCIPA. Hit the mark squarely. And stinking enjoyable too."
West Coast IPA,4.15,"Haven’t had this in almost 10 years so here go: pours a deep, dark gold with decent head. Smells of grapefruit and herbal hops. Tastes like grapefruit rind, melon, orange, strawberry, it’s bitter, and a little herbal with a string malt base. A little dry, also, and very drinkable and balanced. Whether this is close to the beer I had back in 2012 is hard to say, and I’m way more tolerant of hops now than then, but this is good and I’ll buy it again, cheers!"
West Coast IPA,4.35,"An outstanding example of the style, West Coast IPA. Pours an inviting amber/orange with 1 finger of foamy off white head. Nose is full of pine needles and citrus. Taste follows the nose. Grapefruit and Pine, rounded out by Carmel malt with a dry and bitter finish. Worthy of its outstanding rating."
West Coast IPA,4.1,"An all-around great IPA, bursting with citrus and tropical flavors amidst its dry hops. The rich orangey-amber color is particularly inviting. A solid, if not exceptional west coast IPA."
West Coast IPA,4.55,fresh 6 from MD; excellent WC IPA
West Coast IPA,4.21,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.3%. Orange to amber colour, moderate head, slightly off-white. Lovely and intense aroma of citrussy American hops, hits you as soon as the bottle is opened. Also notes of tropical fruits and pine. Some sweetish malts in the background. The flavour is neither too sweet nor too dry, and is a veritable hoppy explosion from start to finish. Grapefruit, bitter orange marmalade, pine needles, resin. A classic!"
West Coast IPA,4.16,"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a deep clear orange hue with half an inch beige head. Plenty of hops, pine on the nose. Taste is of tropical fruit with the bitterness of grapefruit. Pine, citrus. Very drinkable and interesting IPA...well balanced for the blend of hops."
West Coast IPA,4.1,"Excellent IPA, but not a double. Latest versions are more around 7%."
West Coast IPA,3.75,"Pours a crystal clear dark gold with a creamy white head.

Smells like sweet biscuit maltiness with pine and tangerine.

Sweet biscuity malt on the palate, finishing with a nice drying pine bitterness and a hint of grapefruit.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol warmth is present, but blends in.

Overall, a solid, textbook example of the style. It will scratch the itch if WCIPA is the itch that you have."
West Coast IPA,4.09,Clear amber body with a dirty beige head that crashes in on itself before too long. Piney scent combines the alcohol and hops in a spicy to near astringent aroma. Toasty malt base gives a hint of sweetness along with some pith before spicy hops start to wash over the malt. Pine follows right on the heels and dries the medium light-bodied drink.
Oatmeal Stout,5,"Absolutely superb. Poured into a pint glass at 52F. Pours the deepest dark cherry; almost black with a finger of khaki head which dissipates down to a ring with an island that sticks around. Smell is rich caramel and chocolate. Taste is caramel, chocolate, plum, with delicious creaminess. Somewhat dry and bitter finish that gives off coffee and toffee. This beer has some complex character with a low ABV. Great carbonation and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and the taste morphs and develops with each sip; the changes with temperature are epic and delightful! Couldn't ask for a better oatmeal stout! Highly recommend!"
Oatmeal Stout,4.35,"Pretty good Stout from Samuel Smith just wished the ABV % was higher, but very drinkable beer."
Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

The look it almost black when held up to light, only letting a little through and revealing its true dark brown nature. A one finger head forms, but it fades to a fine cap pretty quick. Lacing forms right off the bat however.

The smell is quite rich with a dark chocolate/coffee note, with some yeasty dried fruit notes as well. Sort of like Guinness but sweeter and more pungent. Has the signature ""sam Smith smell"" as well. Not sure what makes their beers so unique but all their dark Ales have that characteristic, but.its hard to decribe.

Taste follows the smell with malts being the main event here. Not very fruity in flavor until the aftertaste. Lots of coffee undertones as well. Beers flavor is not as sweet, but still has that sam Smith signature sweetness with it. One of my favorite stouts out there.

Feel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation bite to keep it balanced. Each sip is very smooth and almost velvety. Not super heavy though although it can seem that way at first.

Overall a delicious traditional oatmeal stout. Not americanized and really not hoppy at all, going more into roasty sweetness and focusing on mouthfeel and drinkability. Very good rich and malty."
Oatmeal Stout,5,Very delicious.
Oatmeal Stout,3.94,"Pours a deep and ruddy brown out of the bottle, resulting in an opaque body that borders on black when poured into a typical pint glass. A tight and creamy one finger thick head appears — over the next little while it collapses into a thick off-white cap that persists throughout. Thick lines of lace dot the glass throughout.

Wow, such delightful aromas of chocolate! For a stout that is not advertised as such, nor has any additives in that way, nor any ‘chocolate’ malts, it has a deep and rich cacao note on the nose. Caramel, toffee, moist cake aromas here as well, along with some toasted wheat. Very sweet character

Surprisingly silky smooth sip, the flavours following the nose but bringing out more of the oat character, which gives the beer a thicker body and a twang of bitterness. Though it is not as bitter as you might expect, not from any hop bitterness or any burnt/roasted malt bitterness. There is just a touch to balance out the sweetness. It is lighter than expected as well, which allows the sweetness to mix without being too cloying. Chocolate, roasted caramel malt flavours dominate here. There is a gentle dark fruit flavour such as dark cherries you may notice on some sips. Some coffee on the front of the tongue but it fades quickly.

Silky smooth body, the carbonation is lower and only gently pricks at your tongue, giving this a supremely smooth and creamy taste. It is medium bodied, lighter than you’d expect, and the finish is not as dry as advertised. A very gentle, subtle finish that leaves only a hint of chocolate, malt, and cacao beans in your mouth.

Surprised by this beer, I would say it’s more subtle than you’d think. For an oatmeal stout, it definitely goes for balance compared to many others. With all that said, if you expect a typical strong roasted/almost burnt malt taste with strong oatmeal character and an oily body with unique bitterness, you will be disappointed here. If you’re looking for an easy drinking stout, this is great. If you’re looking for a stout with chocolate flavours that isn’t overwhelming like some chocolate stouts or a chocolate stout without lactose, this is an excellent choice.

Overall it’s quite an excellent beer and absolutely has its place. I am glad I got two, as this is definitely an enjoyable beer you could knock more than a few back through the night."
Oatmeal Stout,4.04,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent had roast malt notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and coffee presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer."
Oatmeal Stout,5,"As the label clearly states ""The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout""...

Poured a full four finger tan head right up to the rim of the pilsner glass. Very sweet malt notes on the nose, almost like a fresh bran muffin. Not quite as opaque and dark as the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter in the glass.

Just enough malt sweetness on the palate, like a really rich barley soup, full flavored without being overwhelming. Retains a little sweetness, whatever hops used are also light and sweet on the aftertaste. Perfect balanced flavor.

Body exactly right, slightly oily weight, not too thin not too heavy.

As close to a perfect Stout as I have ever had. Been revisiting old favorites and finding myself pleasantly surprised how well many have held up over the years. There's only a tiny handful of beers I give a perfect score to, and this is one of them. In fact, if I was forced to only have one brand and type of beer the rest of my life, I would choose this one. Richer and sweeter than Guinness, this one stout ticks all the boxes for me. No negatives, all positives, right down to the ABV... It lingers on the palate, with the complexity of a good single malt scotch. If I haven't been clear I really really like this beer."
Oatmeal Stout,3.89,"Quality beer that pours a dark brown with a thick head. After trying the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout, this one was a disappointment. A bitter hop flavor, it's not nearly as refreshing as the chocolate counterpart. I've had better Oatmeal Stouts, but you could do much worse. I'd probably never get it again at the price point"
Oatmeal Stout,3.6,"Deep dark brown body, rapidly forming a solid, thick, mocha head, fine and with great retention.
Fruity chocolate aroma - cassis, blackberry, black cherry - not so much roasty or rich, and even lightly floral.
The taste follows suit, with fruity cocoa notes of dark fruit, acidic, with a bittersweet tang of espresso; medium light body and carbonation, verging on watery, although the oats, a bit of residual sugars, and a powdery feel help give it some substance; the semi-dry finish is long, with more roasty chocolate coming through, but still accompanied by distinct fruitiness.

Not what I expected, one of the fruitier stouts I've tried, nevermind one that isn't deliberately incorporating fruit flavours, and lacking body. In the end, it's enjoyable, and probably more so if you know what to expect.
Edit - what I tasted is so far off other reviews, my batch is potentially off"
Oatmeal Stout,3.88,"I bought a bottle at the LCBO in Ontario 550ml at 5%. Poured a 2finger creamy head into pint glass.
The smell was very nice coffee and chocolate malts .
Taste was very smooth and creamy oatmeal with a hint of toffee and coffee just sipping on it
Overall this oatmeal stout is very enjoyable to drink leaving a lace all the way down but it feels stronger then 5%
Good beer
Cheers"
Oatmeal Stout,4.52,"Looks like a stout should, and pours a nice thick tan head into a pint glass. Aromas are not as pronounced as some others maybe, but what is there very nice. The taste is excellent, with expected roasted malts beng the star. Nearly perfect balance and feel. One of the best stouts IMO, when you don't want any added fruits, coffee, etc. Perfect brew for a cool damp November evening. Every stout lover should know this world-class beer as a reference for the benchmark."
Oatmeal Stout,5,"It's an absolute classic. Bubbling, thick and rocky tan head. Coffee and toffee on the nose. The palate carries strong notes of coffee and malted barley with grassy hop-bitterness in the background. Moreover, one can tell this stout was brewed with good water, and the result is incredibly drinkable. In my opinion this is a perfect beer."
Oatmeal Stout,4.6,Very good. One of my new favs.
Oatmeal Stout,4.64,Everything from Samuel Smith is excellent! This one is not exception. taste of Toffee/Caramel and Oats. What could go wrong.....smooth full bodied malty heaven.
Hoptimum,2.71,"Yields a clear amber color with a bigger, stable head.

The aromas lead with ripe passion fruit, caramel and dried lime zest among flowery blueberries and nutty honey.

Drinks soft, with a smooth mouthfeel and a well nuanced, late effervescence, which successfully manages to establish a slightly alcoholic refreshment.

Tastes of sweet caramel, creme brulee and white bread dough, together with bitter, pungent limes and a sweet, resinous malt backbone. Offers an equally sweet middle part with a medicinal hop bitterness, bringing out a buttery, toffee leaden sweetness. Finishes soft with a layer of whipped cream and additional caramel, only to invite a hop bitterness, which numbs the tongue like a local anesthesia, revealing a faint hint of alcohol.

Not a big fan as this seems not very balanced, as well as the beer‘s single components seem unable to create a flavorful synergy. Everything in this is overpronounced and standing in its own way, trying to steal the show while being too full to dance."
Hoptimum,4.38,"This beer is hands down one of the best Imperial IPAs in the world. Nothing but hops from the head down, smell and taste is of hop resin, pine and slight grapefruit. You can also smell and taste a slight booziness which is inevitable for this type of beer. The ultimate cure for a hop fix if you’ve ever needed one."
Hoptimum,4.25,"Pours a fairly clear golden color with about two inches of a light tan head. The smell is of some citrus, strong pine and hops. The taste is definitely on the pine and hops side and the alcohol is hidden well. Definitely worth it."
Hoptimum,4.23,"Enjoyed it when I was new to craft beer, appreciate it still as an experienced hop head. It has all the marks of quality, but is as inoffensive as a hoppy, high abv, in-your-face beer can be. Lots of malts and well rounded hops that aren’t overly bitter or resinous, but still taste citrusy and flavorful. Too booze and too sweet. But overall a well made brew."
Hoptimum,4.58,"The pour and appearance is beautiful. Reddish gold, nearly two inches of head, great retention, mostly clear. It doesn't taste high abv, but you do feel it on your tongue and as you drink it. Good amount of pine and definitely a western. Taste gets better as it warms a bit. Very smooth. Great IPA. A new favorite."
Hoptimum,4.22,"L: Reddish gold body
S: Creamy tropical fruit; mango, guava, pineapple, and pine resin.
T: Rich and creamy tropical fruit concentrated with pine resin. Floral notes on the finish, and a lingering piney bitterness that plays back and forth with a bit of tropical sweetness.
F: Incredibly smooth from start to finish. The alcohol is very noticeable in the mouth and chest.
O: Similar flavor profile to Heady Topper, but a bit sweeter; would be fun to do a side by side. Shockingly smooth for how high the ABV is. Glad I finally found one."
Hoptimum,4.16,"pours a hazy pale amber body with a cream colored foam head that billows with moderately high retention that leaves a high amount of patchy sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy cap with defined halo

aroma is sweet floral and earthy grapefruit and misc citrus with a malty dark caramel malt backbone

taste follows that up with a honeyed sweetness and a trace amount of pine that flashes towards the end; it's sweet but very hoppy, eventually balancing out. a certain fruitiness can be picked out eventually, but it is nondescript outside of being citrus adjacent.

mouthfeel is high carbonation and thick bodied - a constant battle between thickness and carbonation pillowing. it ultimately runs mid-way between smooth, thick, crisp before abruptly finishing dry and syrup-sweet with a grapefruit hop aftertaste with tinges of lowkey pine

overall:
pretty killer, but balance is missing. it's sweet, honey sweet with a thickness that is at battle with the carbonation to create a disheveled feel that is hard to settle into. it is certainly hoppy, but perhaps a little crowded - the features blend together and meld into more of a flashcard representation rather than a display of different players coming together to make something bigger by highlighting their complementary features."
Hoptimum,4.04,"Checking a long empty box, had Hoptimum--now even more illegal in Mississippi--poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped ""PKGD 03/24/21C,"" trade from friend, into Sierra Nevada tulip pint.

Pours light amber with clarity and 1/2- to 1-finger creamy, cream-colored head, with good retention, leaving nice lace down the glass. Sweet malt aroma off pour, then aromas of grass and pine, and some stone fruit showing as warms. Begins with carbonation and big hop bite, over smooth malt body, soon nearly overwhelmed by alcohol beginning to build, then some sharp and sweet stone fruits are also evident, before a big but not unbalanced bitter piney and alcohol heat finish.

Unsurprisingly, has none of the common defects in huge IPAs, and is an appropriate biggest brother to SNPA and Torpedo."
Hoptimum,4.46,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass in September 5, 2021. There is a ""Package"" date of 05/14/2021 on the bottle.

Appearance: Medium gold color with 2 finger white head. It is slightly hazy, but less hazy than New England IPAs. Head lasts a minute, and there is a little lacing.

Smell: Strong aroma from the hops as expected in an IPA: mostly pine and grapefruit, Also some sweetness like pineapple. Overall the pine and citrus aroma dominates the other aromas.

Taste: There is a strong hops flavor that is both refreshing and bitter. Very fruity and contains flavors of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and a little sweetness as well. Hoptimum has as a very nice after taste. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Strong bodied. High alcohol, which matches the 11.0% listed. I nice thick feel when drinking.

This is a great IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it interesting. It has stronger flavors and body than most other IPAs. This has a good hop bite, but not over-powering. It is a very good IPA, and I would buy this again. One of my favorite IPAs."
Hoptimum,4.5,"L - Golden with a ton of clarity with a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - Tons of fresh, bright, bitter, piney hops along with some citrus and malt notes
T - Follows the nose with a punch of bright, piney, bitter hops up front and throughout tied together with a malt backbone and citrus notes - some honey notes, caramel, earth notes. Some floral notes as well.
F - Medium bodied with moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, soft, yet crisp
O - A pretty solid TIPA"
Hoptimum,4.12,"The pour is honey colored. The taste is bitter grapefruit upfront with some bready malts in the back. The 11% abv is well hidden but I am getting some heat from the alcohol in my throat in the aftertaste. It's a good beer but not sure if I would recommend an entire 4 pack of it, maybe it's more of a 1 & done. Cheers! A-"
Hoptimum,4.32,"The first time I had this beer was in 2012.
12oz bottle pkg date 4/16/21 into a 12oz snifter glass.
L: Pours a clear caramel amber with a light beige 1/2"" creamy head with good retention. Good carbonation. Plenty of spotty and skeletal lacing.
S: Pine, flowers, grass, light malt.
T: Very sweet caramel malt, sweet rich hop flower, honey, grapefruit, sharp apricot, raisins, pine and spruce. Light alcohol midway through and pine/spruce tip enters at the finish making it long but not overpowering.
F: Mouthfeel is sticky, heavy-bodied and intense. It is also lush, soft, and has a creeping long conifer finish that is in excellent balance and contrast with the overall sweet characteristics of the beer. It is somewhat dry at the finish.
O: A very assertive, bold and hop forward triple IPA that is everything an IPA should be. An excellent smooth feeling sweet tasting beer from Sierra Nevada."
Hoptimum,4.11,"Bottling date 4-7-21.
Bright, orange-amber color with a white head that slumped to what looked like a ring of lace fire lapping at the curved glass walls. Clear with a faint murk, no rising bubbles visible but they cascade when swirled.
The smells are classic old school left coast IPA. Big bouquet of flowers and spruce tips, sweet honey, blood orange and apricot jam along side toffee dipped in vodka notes.
First taste is sweet up front but flavoring/ mid boil hops move in quickly to balance the rich, caramel malt backbone. Great complexity and balance - lush and heavy on the tongue but the hop character stands up and keeps this from being cloying.
Not a beer for big gulps, this is a snifter sipper that will have you looking for another soon after draining the glass.
Full bodied and a bit harsh on the back end bitterness and sharp with alcohol but dangerously drinkable and seriously well balanced."
Hoptimum,4.73,"dry finish, surprisingly smooth and refined, malty taste for an imperial but still a strong IPA. not as bitter or biting as most Sierra Nevada offerings. impressed."
Hoptimum,4.5,"I lowkey expected this to taste like alcohol but I ended up being some gas. Great hop flavor still and very drinkable indeed, I do highly recommend if you see it."
Grey Monday,4.47,"750 ml bottle, bottled 05/31/19, 19.2% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing, either. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, fudge, hazelnuts, brown sugar and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be. I thought this was a good overall imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you get the chance!"
Grey Monday,4.44,"2013 and drank in 2022
Look - black thick syrup
Smell - boozy maple barrel and hazelnut
Taste - boozy maple hazelnut barrel
Feel - medium full body slight syrup very light carb
Overall - tasty"
Grey Monday,4,"2018 Vintage
The beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.

The smell is good. It has a nice mix of a sweet alcohol note and sweet hazelnut.

The taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.

The feel is good. It has a heavy body with very little carbonation and a slight burn at the end.

Overall, a good beer worth getting and drinking fresh instead of holding it for a while."

Grey Monday,4.9,Boozy delight!
Grey Monday,4.48,"Woah. This is a huge beer. Hazelnuts on the nose. Chocolatey and nutty on the palate. The booze is there, but it works. Just don't have more than one!"
Grey Monday,4.45,"Pours a very dark brown, or more so, it's black with brown shining through the edges. Its a blood-burgundy color with a clear transparency when direct sunlight pierces it. Head is a finger of khaki-caramel foam after a slow pour, but it fizzles out quickly. Aroma is raisins, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty and caramely malts. Heat is seeping through pretty heavy with a whollop of bourbon booze at the back. Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation. Mouth feel is thick, sticky, velvety and chewy. Overall, thick and boozy with a lot of complexities. It's super rich and full, which is what you'd imagine out of an 20% ABV beer.

Served in a glencairn glass from a 750mL bottle. 2017 vintage, served & reviewed in May of 2020."
Grey Monday,4.84,"Thick, viscous, boozy, Hazelnut goodness.

Nuff Said!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.74,"Takes you right back to Belgium.
Fruity malty and spicy dark golden colour with carbonation and a full bubbly head. Rich and complex but still refreshing."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.1,Tastes like bananas and yeast. How quaint.
Tripel Karmeliet,5,It’s like re-uniting with an old friend
Tripel Karmeliet,4.71,"If you know mainly American made Tripels, well, this one is on another level. Extremely rich, smooth, with a luscious, almost fruity aroma and flavor. Priced like a nice wine, but well worth it for an occasional indulgence."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.45,"Poured from just under fridge temp from a 750ml bottle. Pours a semi-opaque yellow/orange with a LOT of gorgeous head. It takes several minutes for the voluptuous head to recede. The nose is spectacular. An earthy orange, wheat, yeast, marmalade, honey, apricot, and banana. How - very exciting!

The taste is incredible. Sweet toffee, marmalade, apricots, peaches, pineapple, Belgian yeast, orange, candy malts, and banana. This is quite different from many other tripels that I have tasted. Almost entirely sweet without any bitterness. Not too sweet though.

The mouthfeel is fairly light and somewhat dry. Overall, this is probably my favorite tripel to date. Can't wait to have another!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.8,I like it!
Tripel Karmeliet,5,This triple is probably one of the most Unique because it’s made from grain three types of wheat grain gives it a flavor of sweet wheat beer with a kick! Love it!!
Tripel Karmeliet,4.41,"Tall, white head from a VERY gentle, drizzle down the side pour. Audible fizziness as I pour, almost like a soft drink. Very good retention leaving sticky lacing (and a nicely laced empty chalice). Slightly hazy golden body, heavily carbonated.

The aroma is not too strong, but sweet. Bubblegum, and a bit of banana.

The flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. The middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. Behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. The finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. This aftertaste is exquisite!

The mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, I keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. Moderate body.

Karmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet. The feel of the aftertaste is, as I stated above, exquisite. Wow!

An excellent tripel!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.02,"A cloudy orange hued straw color, super bubbly big soapy bubble head. Dissipated relatively fast to a thin layer of opaque white.

Nose is very banana, bubble gum forward, has an almost bread like quality to itself, a touch of something refreshing like apple.

Taste is similar to the nose with all the same parts except the refreshing appleness is more noticeable and on the finish.

Medium body but it drinks very light, the carbonation is big when it hits the tongue, almost bubbles up the whole mouth. A really nice minor acidity on the finish."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.52,"Clear, light golden body; lots of fine carbonation; immensely thick and billowy white head; incredibly dense, thick and sticky rings of foam. Outstanding fruity aroma and pleasant esters; floral notes; candi sugar; peach and green apple. Delicate honey and fresh cut fruit on the palate; moderate sweetness; mild spiciness, cloves primarily but also hints of nutmeg and cinnamon; light bitterness; slightly phenolic. Medium body; light velvet feel; dry mouthfeel overall.

What a fine tripel! Gorgeous appearance and aroma with a fantastically complex and balanced flavor profile.

Pouring temperature: 54 °F; bottling data: 06/04/23E (neck label)"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.48,"Wonderful triple. Pretty much the industry standard for the style. Only the monks can do it better.

Full menagerie of banana, spice, fruit goodness countered with the peppery yeast and strong malt. Wheat is detectable, and the oats must contribute to the body.

This tripel leans into the subtleties without hitting the Trappist level of nuance. Great beer"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.29,"Honey/peach/gold colored with a tall foamy head which dissolves into a long lasting thick film and the aromas of sweet malts, some lemon, some honey, flowers, and mild banana.

Smooth rounded sweet malts with some apple, banana, clove, citrus zest, and honey

A fizzy mouthful that finishes with a clean peppery bite and a slightly pithy aftertaste

A truly excellent example of the style"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.33,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip.

The beer pours a clear golden yellow with about three fingers worth of fluffy white head that recedes slowly leaving behind bits of spotty lacing

The nose is grainy and yeasty with notes of lemon zest, banana, a slight bit of spice and just a hint of floral hops

Similar to the aroma the flavor is biscuity and zesty with notes of banana and yeast. There are also hints of spiciness and light fruits. Medium bodied and well carbonated with a sticky finish

Overall this is really quite a nice beer, deceptively easy to drink for the 8.4% abv."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.75,"Wonderfully balanced, rich flavor, not overpowering"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.82,"11.2oz bottle

Life can be an utter nightmare, devoid of pleasures and amounting to nothing more than a rigorous course of turmoil for damned souls, so once in a while you need a reminder that there might be more to this realm, and this is one such reminder, in beer form. Looks like a snowglobe, filled with various films and floaters. Smells like warm grain and banana. Powdery feeling, dry, banana and clove and honey, sweet but w/ burps of fuel sitting at 8%. Thanks for the brief reprieve you Belgian wizards"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.94,"Very nice beer, has a very nice initial taste followed by a sweet almost Honey after taste"

Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.63,"L - Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a medium brown color. Two finger off white/light tan head on medium-aggressive pour. Head appears frothy. Lacing is frothy and dissipates back to head quickly. Reduces down to a film. Can bring back a small head with agitation.

S - Bready malts up front. Some sweetness as well. A little bubble gum or even honey. A little spice too.

T - Taste is a wonderful caramel molasses, with bready malt. Some dark fruits and spice come in also. Bubble gum and cola hits as well. No hoppy bitterness at all. A little bitter chocolate though.

F - Excellent medium mouthfeel and solid carbonation.

O - Overall, this beer is a treat. I love malt-forward beers, and this one does not disappoint. The whole Trappistes Rochefort range is one of my favorites. This is already in my regular rotation, and I highly recommend it to all."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.51,"0.3 L bottle
Bottle Date: L 15.10.2019
Glass: 0.33L Rochefort Chalice/Goblet
Temp at Pour: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Cloudy and opaque chestnut brown with a 1-finger creamy tan head. The head dissipates to a 0.25"" cover that only starts to break up when I start sipping the beer. Excellent lacing down along the glass

Smell:
Sweet fruits along with dark fruits such as dates, raisins, currants, and plums. Touches of brown sugar. Hints of baking spices such as nutmeg and Ceylon cinnamon. Very slight booziness. There is a faint underlying malt note also.

Taste:
Closely follows the nose with the fruits leading the parade but are then joined by more pronounces spices and bready malts. A sip finishes sweet with a very slight alcohol burn.

Feel:
Smooth and velvety with a medium-full body.

Overall:
An outstanding BSDA and an outstanding beer. This bottle is more than a tad old - it is over a year and a half past it's best-before date and was purchased over 6.5 years ago (Nov, 2015). And it is still very, very good."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.56,"A careful pour yields a finger and a half of a large frothy white head, which dissipates leaving a white bubbly ring around the glass. A deep, chestnut brown colour that is very cloudy.

It’s got a nose as delicious as any strong Belgian dark, so you know what you’re getting. The stars for Rochefurt 8? Deep aromas of raisins and dried dark fruits, sugared and caramelized desserts and fruits, very rich and gorgeous smelling yeasty, doughy breads. A lot of spices mixing in here, I’ve never been an expert on spices but you can always recognize cloves, though I wouldn’t say that’s the major spice smell here. Cardamom? Blackcurrant?

Lovely and complex taste, which (as contrived as this always sounds) follows the nose pretty tightly. Those doughy, chewy malts are just too enjoyable. Definitely nice and sweet, the high alcohol level brings tastes of rum, raisins, and figs, as they always do for malty Belgian dark ales. Spicy cloves and peppery notes dance around, the candi sugar on the palate also gives me a gentle cinnamon impression, though it intermingles well with all the spices. Long, tasty doughy finish, very malty and bready. Nutty toffee, caramelized desserts. What else can you say? It’s phenomenal as always.

Now, while the flavours are strong for beers in general, I’m going to say they are wonderfully balanced for Belgian dark ales. Strong dark malty beers like Aventinus Eisbock is more of an explosion of these flavours, and certain other Belgian darks are more unrestrained. This works in this beers favour, for anyone who enjoys the style will enjoy the complex evolution of the flavours over time.

Medium bodied and fairly sweet, this is slightly more carbonated than others in this style, medium carbonation overall. The good carbonation coupled with the small bubbles creates a foamy and creamy sip. Semi-dry finish with well concealed alcohol that emerges just enough to breathe life into the flavours on the palate, giving them a unique dimension.

Hell of a beer. Absolutely delicious, while some lament the size of their cellar list, I am always happy I have so many Rochefurt beers in mine!"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.5,"Yowzer! Really do I need to say much more than it's from Belgium. Okay .... Beautiful dark caramel color, super smooth and delicious and packs a punch too .... Terrific!"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.61,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy light brown color with some orange hues towards the bottom. A soft pour produced about three fingers of meringue-like off-white head.

Smell: Yeast, nuts, sugar, old kitchen spices, sage comes to mind as well as allspice.

Taste: Sweet up front, raisin bread, burnt sugar, once the sweetness fades away I get a slightly toasted note along with some nuts. Can't detect any bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied, loads of carbonation, dry, can't feel any alcohol warmth.

Overall: Delicious. It hides it's abv very well."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.54,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice glass, the ""best before end"" date is ""L.03.02.2026"" which I understand to be March 2, 2026. I also understand the bottled date is five years prior so that would indicate this one was bottled on March 2, 2021.

APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, brown color and there are larger bits of sediment floating about when held up to light, bountiful two finger head that slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is some lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a beautiful beer!

SMELL: bread, sweet chocolate, dark fruits like fig and raisin.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet bread and chocolate with dark fruits like fig and raisin, the 9.2% ABV is well disguised.

PALATE: medium body and somewhat creamy, medium carbonation.

OVERALL: this is a great BSDA, I love this style, one of my all time favorites but hard to find, Chimay Blue is the other I can recall having and this one stacks up very well, I will buy this again and will recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."

Smells of slightly bready, caramel malt and candied fruit, with hints of brown sugar, spice and honey as well. Taste is a great balance of slightly bready, caramel malt and strong candied fruits, with notes of fig, date and plum, as well as lighter apple and apricot, distinct brown sugar and honey, with some spicy accents of clove and cardamon as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a strong sweetness and some candied fruit, brown sugar and hints of spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light carbonation.

While this certainly makes for a very rich and complex example of the style, it's just too sweet for my personal taste, which is somewhat mitigated by a light bitterness in the finish, while I can also appreciate those spicy accents, but those overwhelming caramel malt, brown sugar and honey notes are bit much for me, bordering on cloying, while the fruity notes feel quite candied as well, resembling those candied fruit bits you get in fruitcakes. This certainly has a certain feel of fruitcake drenched in honey to it overall and while some may love that, it's really not for me. I much prefer the darker and a bit more roasty and bitter Rochefort 10, which is a lot better balanced to my personal taste."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.39,"A-burnt orange cloudy, with prodigious white creamy head from the carbonation. Pour gently.
S-Mild essence of yeasty brown bread, dark fruits
T-Bready nutty malts, spices, sweet but not overly. Below average bitter.
M-Luscious for a medium (-) body. High carbonation.
O-First time for the style, and this specimen is wonderful"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.09,"I bought a bottle today at the LCBO in Ontario 330ml at 9.2%.
Poured a 1 to 2finger head into glass.
Leaving a lace all around as you drink it.
The beer is strong just sipping on it but it seems very easy to drink it with a medium bitterness level.
Overall a great Belgium beer
Cheers"
Trappistes Rochefort 8,5,"Purchased at the LCBO on 11/11/21. Stored at 4 C, on it's side, and poured into a chalice.

Appearance - Pours a maduro brown, it's the spitting image of the wrapper of the cigar I'll be smoking after dinner, a CAO Flathead Carb 660, with a medium thickness white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film, a little thicker in the center.

Smell - Strong fruits with a nice nutty, malty undertone tying it all together. I'm picking up raisins, currants and it reminds me of fruitcake. In the best way possible, I like a rich, well made fruitcake.

Taste - Just a slight hint of alcohol burn at first taste, which is quickly killed by the maltyness. The above noted fruit flavours then rush in and it's a long finish more malt and baking spices.

Feel - I love the creamyness of this beer, it's full bodied with carbonation on the milder side of medium. Nicely coats the mouth, enhancing the finish.

Overall - This is one of my favourite beers. Top 3. I prefer it over the 10. The mix of the flavours and just how it's so beautiful tied together is something of beauty."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,5,"Appearance: Cloudy, saddle brown. Mousse-like, tan head with great retention

Aroma: Fruity esters: plum, apricot, apple

Flavor & aftertaste: Follow aroma, plum, apricot, apple. Low bitterness

Mouth-feel: Medium to full- bodied. Moderate carbonation. A little creamy

Overall: Outstanding. Would never know this is a 9.2% abv beer. Nice looking pour with excellent head and retention. Layered fruity esters in the aroma & flavor. These beers always fool me at first. Their aromas seem one or two dimensional at first, but as you make your way to the bottom of the glass, keep swirling and sniffing and more complexity comes out. Very easy drinking. No flaws in this bottle."
Trappistes Rochefort 8,4.16,"Dark raisin brown in color. Poured with a fizzy, tall, off-white foam with medium low retention. Aromas of dark fruit, sweet fig, and mellow dark malt. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Dark fruity flavors, fig and raisin, with mellow dark malts - similar to aroma. Very low spicy hop flavor followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the end. Finished dryly as the fruity and malty presence was overtaken by the booziness. A pleasant, boozy, cool weather ale. Very nice."
Tripel,4.19,"Surprised and horrified I haven't reviewed this yet. Been at least 13 years since I've had this. Bottled about 5 months back.

A clear light golden orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is great, a blend of pear esters, petrichor, mild earth and soft apple notes, along with a clean, gorgeous yeast character, moderately spicy with pepper and clove. Clean, balanced focused with a blend of honey drizzled pears, light melon, red delicious apples and a soft, delicate yeasty spice note that can only come with focus and intent. A blend of light clove, pepper and floral notes. Gorgeous stuff. Lovely mouthfeel, briskly carbonated but never distracting."
Tripel,4.09,"On tap at British Open. Golden yellow like a perfect beer. More subtle than most tripels. Smooth, sweet, slightly herbal, and a bit of hops. A complex beer."
Tripel,4,"Yep. It’s a Tripel - but not one that Ty Cobb hit. This one is more like a ball hit to Manny Ramierez aided by his “amazing” defense. Probably should be a single with a two base error, but the hometown official scorer is drunk, so whatever.

Rat a tat crackerjack!"
Tripel,3.8,Very smooth for a boozy beer.
Tripel,4.18,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours a nice semi-transparent yellow with white head. Nose is honey, lemon, wheat, peaches, grass, and yeast. Really nice! Taste is nice and sweet. Candy, slight hops, honey, peach, leather, grass. Amazing. Mouthfeel is fairly light and refreshing. Overall, a fantastic tripel."
Tripel,4.18,"a slowish pour (to keep out sediment) shows lots of small continuous bubbles in a light golden honey colored beer and ghives you a thin head that quickly becomes a long lasting film

not much of an aroma, some banana, clove, a bit of tropical fruit

Sweetish with bananas, cloves, a touch of honey, and a hint of tropical fruit (the passion fruit?), no pepper or any other kind of bite

Lots of fizzy carbonation give this a full and smooth mouthful leaving a slight banana/clove aftertaste and a thin film on your tongue

The major drawback is the sweetness. There is a lack of complexity and finish, the flavors are well balanced, but they all lean towards the sweet end of the spectrum and there isn't anything other than the carbonation to provide a clean finish.

Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice tripel. I certainly wouldn't turn it down and, considering the reasonable price, I will likely be buying more."
Tripel,4.29,"sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my chalice. Bottled on 11/17/2021. Picked up for the tripel tasting a few weeks ago and in my cellar since.
The beer pours a partly hazy golden color with a fizy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up. This foam sticks around as one large island and a sturdy edge layer throughout the sampling.
the aroma is a nice mix and fairly complex with fruity notes of white grape mixing with a bit of honey and some spicy yeast notes too, cloves is what I find. No hint of booze and the beer has a nice aroma overall. After a few swirls the head foams back up to a sturdy full surface layer.
First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer drinks easy on the physical traits.
Flavor is some bready malt and general fruitiness mixing with some banana too. I also get some black pepper and cloves and then a very dry finish. Dont really get any ABV warmth. Not really a hop note and the finish lingers with a bit of peppery bite too.
A nice beer that seems to be easier to find and from a brewery that seems to know what they are doing with Belgian style beers."
Tripel,4.24,"Smell: definitely picking up the hops as well as the yeast. I am getting the passion fruit mentioned in the description.

Look: perfectly reasonable yellow, I didn't get much of a head but I think it's the glass.

Taste/feel: sweet, chewy, fizzy, feels like eating a delicious foamy candy. An alcoholic one. The alcohol is not shy.

Probably not my absolute favorite of the style but still an excellent beer."
Tripel,4.14,"A careful pour from a chilled but not cold couple of stout brown bottles into a clear glass liter mug yielded almost the same inches of foam as liquid. It's that ugly starchy white foam, with relatively large bubbles that recedes unevenly and leaves scant lacing inside the glass. Self-described as a golden ale, that aspiration falls short. The color beneath the head is a pale yellow-amber, bright and a bit cloudy. The smell is definitely of a Belgian ale, with its yeasty aspect that is unmistakable. Yet, this drinks cleanly and with only a little of that ""banana"" taste reference than can be annoying to many. Although not super complex, there's enough malt for some honey like sweetness as well as a good body. The rest of the tastes include moderately bitter hopping, a vague fruitiness, a noticeable, but not detracting, alcohol presence and even some spicy hints during the finish. Even those that don't like Belgians should find this a drinkable offering. There's plenty to like within the taste and the mouthfeel is excellent. Quite the recovery from the initial pour."
Tripel,4.13,"Pours a murky translucent deep lemon color with a short lived white creamy/foamy head.Smell is hard to explain, like a clean earthy essence, which is nice. a little Belgian yeast banana scent. At first a citrus hint which turns into a banana, combined with the malt give it sort of a banana bread essence. Feels medium bodied, not chewy,a tad bit syrupy , you know you are drinking a big beer. The ABV is not hidden all too well. Overall a good sipping ale. Would not take this out on any summer occasion. Too thick. Compared to Duvel which is a similar strength Belgian golden ale the Duvel is way more refreshing and drinkable in my opinion. Allagash is the best American brewery who brew Belgian style beers. I like other Allagash beers better-"
Tripel,4.1,"Smooth mouth feel, honey banana yet not ""sweet"", ultra long finish. Luscious mouth feel with a little fizz."
Tripel,4.16,"Absolutely huuuuge head. Smell is classic tripel- yeast, bread, hints of banana, esters, coriander. The taste is rich- the esters really stand out, along with the yeast, and is backed up with just enough hoppiness. Hints of coriander, lemon, and honey too, and a wonderful sweet, grassy finish. The alcohol is noticeable. Semi dry finish. This is a wonderful beer."
Tripel,4.16,"This was a very interesting concoction for a tripel - passionfruit and honey, and then they somehow made it dry - it was a truly amazing experience to savor. The booze is hidden behind the light notes of the fruit and honey, but the booze finally catches up to you. Definitely worth the try..."
Tripel,4.29,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass. 1/01/22 date, I assume that's a best by date.

L---Lightly cloudy, bright medium golden color. Fluffy white head had nice retention and left beautiful lacing.

S---Coriander is strong. Some yeast as well.

T---Honey and passionfruit. Coriander shows up. Super long finish showcases the passionfruit.

F---Medium/full body with a little bit of heat from either the coriander or the ABV. Ample carbonation.

O---A really nice one. Hard to believe I've never had this one before."
Tripel,4.47,"Pours a fairly clear yellow with fine, soapy head.

Smell is fruity and yeasty with a phenolic twist. Notes of citrus, dried fruit, bananas, apples and some passionfruit.

Taste is fruity and spicy with a nice yeasty touch. Notes of dried fruit, citrus, banana, slightly peppery rye dough and hint of passionfruit and bitterness.

Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with frothy carbonation.

Overall, a terrific tripel, probably the best non-Belgian I've had."
Tripel,4.03,"(From 12fl bottle into tulip glass)
L: color is a golden yellow. Head is pure white, very quickly dissipated compared to most other triples. Bubbles don’t combine into a soapy texture, rather they stay independent when they meet the surface. Not much lacing

S: fruity (apple, pear, passion fruit). Some sweet malt and thick honey. Floral.

T: Honey is forefront. Floral and a fruity bite towards the middle-end. Nice yeast character. Touch of sweet malt. I’m not getting much hops.

F: Very smooth; no carbonation rush or hops. Odd aftertaste and finish, kind of finishes rather “bleh” or unremarkable. Medium bodied.

O: I middling tripel. It was smooth and enjoyable, but did not have a lot of the characteristics and notes that I’ve come to expect from some of the best triples. You do get the honey notes, so if that’s of interest I would recommend trying it."
Tripel,3,I really don't taste anything more special in this tripel than in the others. Overall it's a quite average drink. The only thing that stands out is the lingering after taste. Should've gotten Allagash White instead.
Tripel,4.5,"12oz bottle, bottled on 02/04/21 14:28. Served in a Westmalle chalice.

Appearance: Hazy golden yellow. Thin white head with islands and sheets of persistent lacing.

Smell: Yeasty, with classic Belgian yeast fruity esters.

Taste: Honey, fruity esters, a bit of tropical fruit, old noble hop bitterness at the finish. Quite nice.

Mouthfeel: Just right carbonation - a little prickly on the tongue and it leaves some spiciness at the finish. Nicely thick underneath, with a bit of a dry finish.

Overall / Drinkabilility: Delightful. Well balanced, lots of good flavor, enjoyable from start to finish, and a delight to look at in the glass. Everything one would want in a Tripel. Well done and well crafted!"
Tripel,4.12,"Pours a golden with opulent white head retention. Banana and warming spices on the nose. There's banana and golden raisin sweetness coupled with enough bitterness so as not to give the whole Christmas fruit cake vibe. While it has the requisite Tripel character, it feels well attenuated and kinda dry. There's a bready finish. It's smooth and pleasant."
Tripel,4.04,"Typical beer color golden clear.
Nose has malt coriander and orange
Finish is smooth with slight orange.
Overall a really nice beer. Was not expecting so much"
Tripel,4,"12oz bottle

L: hazy golden body with a thin white head
S: grass, herbal, spicy yeast, lemon; a little skunky
T: spicy yeast, lemongrass, tart passion fruit, pale grain, herbal/spicy/grassy hops
F: fuller body, moderate carbonation, tangy on the tongue, spicy Belgian yeast lingers on the dry finish
O: not as good as expected, but still very good"
Tripel,4.41,"330ml bottle. A full-on yeast and esters Belgian-style pale ale from Maine, USA. Loads of banana, lemon and cloves. Foaming carbonation and an effortlessly smooth but rich mouthfeel. Massive ABV, well hidden. A true-to-style but incredibly approachable tripel. Excellent."
Tripel,4.16,"#1793 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Paler than golden, it's into mid-straw territory. Ever so slightly hazy (sediment left stuck to base of bottle) and poured with a 10mm fine-bubble white head that looks like sticking around...
S- Subtle, some antique/aromatic timber notes.
T- BOOOOOF!! I wasn't expecting that! Mega Belgian yeast ester notes, massive - there is absolutely ZERO doubt what style of beer this is. Solid spice notes, mega-banana, dripping in yeasty-esters...
F- Deep complex and yet not heavy or wearisome on the palate.
O- This is front and centre, left, right and behind Belgian yeast notes in spades. Use this on a beer-innocent friend as a solid demo of what Belgian yeast notes can be like when it's really maxed up. Then, I have to remind myself and tip my hat, this beer is not Belgian at all but American. Oh yes, that'll suprise some people, the land of Milwaukee Ice can also yield forth such gems as this. Wow, again, what a wonderful surprise this is....
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! They talk of notes of passion-fruit and honey. Luckily I get neither outright, I just get a reeeeally nice 1 in 50-100 darn superb beer experiences... Wow it's 9%, but it's not shouty about it at all. AND big WOW again it cost £7.30 for a 355ml bottle, jeez!! Well I'm glad I enjoyed it so much.
330ml bottle BB: 22/10/21 (1yr post-bottling date shown). Bought from BeautifulBeers/BurySt.Edmunds as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,3.44,"Looks like soupy molasses with a short brown head that quickly dissipates. Syrup film lace on the glass.
Smell and Taste: Chocolate and coffee. Pungent, sour notes that I don't care for.
Feel: Well I'm guessin' with 9.4% ABV I'll be feelin' pretty good by the time I finish it.
Overall: Not my cup of tea. I'm hopin' on."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.4,"Visually beautiful, it pours out silky and thick - very impressive, sweet and inviting in the nose, this RIS was one of the better ones I’ve had. Taste is slightly muted but still good, the alcohol is barely noticeable…until it hits, then you can’t escape it. This was really a very good RIS. One to keep in mind for the cookies months ahead."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.64,"Traded a Dark Lord for one of these in like 2010? Maybe 2009 or 2011. But definitely a long time ago. This fucker has been aging.

Pour is inky black but still very nicely fizzy. Wisp of a brown head. Really incredible pour, considering the strength and age.

Aroma is, likewise, surprisingly bright and nice. I remember someone, in some vague context, telling me I had been hosed in the trade. I dunno. Back then I was lousy with FFF rarities. This wears its age nicely, and there's no hint that it wouldn't have been good-to-great if consumed several years earlier. Very dark chocolate and coffee, some pleasantly sharp grain. The nodes that are discernably aged mellow it out but don't overwhelm it with the sort of overripe fruit nodes that often denote staleness.

Flavor is, again, surprisingly great. It tastes like a more or less fresh double stout, only wonderfully smoothed over. Aggressive but never overwhelming. Dark, dark, dark and bitter chocolate up front, bittersour grain in the middle, and a wee bitty kiss o' the hops on the finish.

Maybe I'm just an aging man with atavistic pretensions. Maybe beers were just better before the market got oversaturated. I dunno. What I do know is I liked this quite a bit."

B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.16,"Bomber from Tavour. Near black pour, ring of brown head. Aroma is chocolate and roasty malts. Taste is sweet, chocolate, roast. Simple but so deep. Slick feel from the oats. Wonderfully smooth with a nice warm, bitter finish."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,3.64,"Rerate, 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger.ABV is 9.4%. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Fairly strong sweetish aroma, also roasty notes, loads of molasses and chocolate, also notes of mild coffee and liquorice. The flavour is very roasty with loads of malty sweetness and molasses, also notes of strong coffee, liquorice and dark bitter chocolate. Powerful stuff. I’m upping it a few points.

Original rating: Bottle, as Hoppin’ Frog B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher Oatmeal-Imperial Stout, ABV 9.4%, at RBNAG 2009 in Vatlandsvåg. Pitch black colour, low brown head. Surprisingly moderate aroma of oats and roasted barley, notes of mild coffee, hints of chocolate. The flavour has loads of malty sweetness, verging on sickly, and loads of roasted barley too. Notes of coffee, hints of liquorice and dark chocolate. Slightly acidic finish. Not the best impy stout I’ve had."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.72,"poured from a bomber into a snifter, I let the bottle warm for 2 hours prior to drinking. This seemed to enhance many of the underlying flavors. A great beer from my hometown!"
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,3.75,"Bottle bought at Las Buenas Pulgas, served at home in a snifter glass.
Black colour, small brown head with no retention nor lacing.

Medium body, viscous texture, no carbonation.Sweet finish.
Taste of chocolate, coffee, dried and red fruits, .
Pretty good, more in the nose than in the tongue."
B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher,4.34,"Somehow no review for this, must have been eaten by server crash

Pours a rich thick frothy 1/2 finger chocolate colored head with good retention, nice soapy lacing, good legs as well, pitch black thick beer

Nose has a nice RIS aroma, loads of chocolate and some fudge, cocoa, some roast but not a lot, little coffee and biscuity cookie wafer, a bit of creamy oatmeal like, light fruity note in the background, little toffee, caramel, and baking spices, plenty of cookie biscuits as it warms

Taste brings brings loads of dark malts and smooth rich beer, plenty of creamy oats, a little biscuity cookie dough as well, light caramel and toffee notes, fair lush creamy chocolate, like Lindor rich chocolate, velvety as well, fudge and cocoa, little baking spice and hint of alcohol, a bit of roast and coffee but light, a touch of vanilla in there as well, fair sweetness in general with a touch of bitterness up front, then finish dries a bit and borders to med bitterness but still on the lighter side for the style, lots of lingering creamy lush cocoa and spice

Mouth is fuller bod, rich creamy thick velvety, med-light foamy carb, very light warming alcohol (a touch more carb brings this to 4.75)

Overall solid RIS with oatmeal, lots of great malt characters, cocoa, chocolate, light roast, cookie wafer, lots of creamy oats brings more biscuity notes and super velvety, alcohol hidden fairly well, nice spices and light fruity notes, enjoyable"
Nut Brown Ale,3.96,"Very surprised I had not reviewed this beer.

Poured from a bottle into a a tumbler. Clear dark brown color with great head and curtain lacing. Sweet dark bread smell and taste. Caramel and toffee. Bit of chocolate. Pleasant beer!"
Nut Brown Ale,4.24,Wow! What a beer this ridiculously smooth brown ale has you wanting more. Pours a brown perfect color with mild carbonation. Smells of mild malt with nutty aromas. An oldy but a goody!
Nut Brown Ale,3.94,"A staple back in the late 80's when so few good beers could be found.
Bright, light brown color and crystal clear supporting a thin barely off-white head that slumps quickly.
Aroma is mild malt with hints of chocolate and brown sugar but you have to go looking for them.
The flavors, at least in retrospect, are solid dark mild / brown ale flavors. Mild and slightly sweet, the complexity of the earthy hops and caramelized grain stand up despite the thin body and mouth feel
Traditional flavors as far as this US drinker can tell though not the depth of character it's label and mystique suggests."
Nut Brown Ale,4.16,"Pours a clear tawny brown, .75"" light tan head, minimal lacing. Nose is moderate malt, hard water, light caramel. Taste avoids sweetness, instead a rich, heady flavor of roasted malt balanced nicely by lightly spiced hops. Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation. Very drinkable and happily readily available."
Nut Brown Ale,4.23,"From a 550ml bottle. Dark copper color with a half inch of cream colored head. Rich, malty aroma. Medium body and slick feel. Rich malt and nutty flavor followed by a hit of floral hops. Very nice"
Nut Brown Ale,4.14,Look is fantastic with a very dark red pour and very light tan head. Lacing on the glass continues while drinking. The nose is crisp and rich rich with notes fresh bread and hops. The taste is special: sweet and nutty up front then toasted malt and mild hoppyness. Body is medium with a nice amount of natural carbonation. Overall a very fine nutty brown.
Nut Brown Ale,4.3,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to rest 15-20 min, before pouring into a round-bottomed stein

Look: Tea-colored, translucent brown, with gold highlights, and a 3-finger tan head

Smell: Bready yeast, sweet malts, and caramel

Taste: dried fruits, caramelized sugar, malts, with a dry, nutty finish

Mouthfeel: Medium overall - light, with strong effervescence. Slight residue left on the tongue. Not chewy or boozy.

Overall: A very well-balanced, malt-forward brown ale. I appreciate how it's not over sweet, and that the bitterness comes across more as a dry finish instead of twisting ones tongue in knots. I can definitely see why it's well-regarded."
Nut Brown Ale,3.85,"A standard brown ale that hits all the right notes. I think the nuttiness is kind of subtle, but the flavor is still very good."
Nut Brown Ale,4.14,"L: clear reddish brown
S: earthy and sweet nuts. Reminds me of honey glazed mixed nuts.
T: toast, malt, toasted hops in addition to the nose. Finishes very earthy
F: very drinkable with good lingering qualities.
O: it's my first brown ale, but this is a very good experience."
Nut Brown Ale,4.37,"Purchased as a 16oz can from The Blue Door for $5.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear deep brown, with a two-finger tan head. Good lacing.
S - Toast, brown bread, and toffee. Earthy.
T - Matches nose exactly, with the addition of a very nutty finish. There's a really nice earthiness from the hops here, and it definitely balances things out.
F - Medium body, with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and very drinkable.
O - I've had this ale before, but only now am I actually reviewing it. A fantastic brown ale. Covers all the bases, and the nuttiness was something I've been craving for a couple of months now. Definitely recommend this one, and I'll be buying it again real soon."
Nut Brown Ale,4,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured a clear rich amber with khaki head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had rich malt base with subtle yeast and nuttiness. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with robust malt with bread and nut presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer."
Nut Brown Ale,4.02,"Look - great slightly dark brown with a nice tan head and lacing
Smell - dark caramel nutty maltiness
Taste - nutty malty slight caramel bread
Feel - medium body and carb
Overall - great but brown"
Nut Brown Ale,4.23,"Poured from ab12oz bottle.
L- Dark brow but you can still se thought it held up to the light. Tan head of frothy bubbles, but not too fine. About 1 finger an dissapates into a ring and a few bubble islands.

S- coffee notes with a dark sweetness and bitter hop notes that balance the malts. Almost herbal funky earthy qualities from the yeast

T- taste follows the smell but is more mellow and creamy. Then it transforms into a roasty slightly bittered aftertaste, the malt and hops work together in this one very well, hops are very traditional.

F- this one is definitely a before bed/winter warmer, very thick and hearty. Good with a big warm traditional steak and potato dinner or maybe a lasagna, comfort foods things like that. Has a nice nostalgic vibe.

O- good to have a couple but not the most seasonable in the world compared to other British styles, but the flavor is very good and the quality shows. A very nice sipper."
Nut Brown Ale,4.62,"Earthy, bold, highly flavorful, and unique. Tastes like I imagine beer would have tasted when knights in armor stomped this planet. There is an antiquity to the character of this beer, and it is not branding, it is real. A very large range of flavors, from slightly tart to sweet to coffee, cocoa powder, mineral, woodsy, smoky... and something indiscernible to my current vocabulary but extremely good. Creamy, silky feel. Lingering wonderful flavors. One of the best ever no doubt."
Nut Brown Ale,3.67,"I poured the beer into an imperial pint nonic, a decent pour produces a nice fluffy off white brownish head, it sticks around for a bit and recedes to a thin cap that leaves a little lace with each sip. The color is medium dark brown and is somewhat translucent. The smell is all malt with a little roastyness, nothing grassy or herbal about it. The taste follows the nose, it's not sweet, but not bitter. I find the taste to be lacking in that ashy roasted barley that I find in other brown ales that I like. The feel is straight up medium body with maybe a little more carbonation than I care for, but seems right for the style. Overall, I like it and would revisit, but I have had better examples of the style."
Nut Brown Ale,4.15,"No obvious date. Only marking I see is SA30T1, on the neck of the bottle.
I've had this several times previous, just never reviewed it, somehow.

Clear chestnut brown, with slight redddish tint if held up to the light. Light tan head, that leaves a thin ring.

Smell is light raisin+date, followed by a nutty (walnut?) aroma after the head fades. Slight, fresh, biscuity malt aroma appears when swirled.

Taste is roasted nuts (walnut+pecan), brown bread, raisin, some hop spiciness, and a vague woody/earthy flavor.

Feel is medium light, initially smooth , with light very,very fine, sharp carbonation bite coming in later. Suspect that this is fairly fresh, or that previous specimens were quite old, as I don't remember it being that sharp. (& I like it better now)

Overall, smooth, easy-drinking, and always a pleasure. Nice to revisit the old standards every now & again."
Nut Brown Ale,3.53,Can in Oktoberfest box. Good head. Flavor: it’s a nut brown. Decent when you’re in the mood.
Nut Brown Ale,4.13,"Review 1636
Nut Brown
Samuel Smith
Date: unknown
I have consumed this beer several times; it surprised me to learn I have not reviewed it. The beer was 44 degrees, and I poured it into a pint glass. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head, a light tan head with good retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a bit of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, mahogany color with ruby hues. When put to a light source, the beer has clarity.

The aromas in the beer are nutty, caramel, toffee, medium roasted malts, a touch of herbal, hint of floral, and malty sweetness.

I taste nuttiness, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, bready, earthiness, a hint of floral, cereal grains, a touch of mineral, and malty sweetness.

The mouthfeel is creamy.

The body is medium, medium-low carbonation, and subtle finish.

A classic nut brown ale with all the goodness to make you go back for more. I enjoy this beer and what this brewery produces. Cheers!"
Nut Brown Ale,4.15,"From a 22 oz bottle bought with a three bottle gift pack. Enjoyed on the side porch while watching the chicks experience their first real grass! 9/19/21 Lovely malty, caramely aroma. Great mouthfeel and the taste is caramel, roast, and stone. I'm not a huge fan of this type, but this was fantastic!"
Nut Brown Ale,4.03,"Lovely orangey brown colour. Thick, brown-tinged, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick bands of lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, hint of chocolate, caramel, and red wine. The taste is quite chocolatey, more chocolatey than nutty I think. The mouthfeel is rounded, refreshing, and not too sweet, very well balanced by the slight bitterness of the roasted malts and the gentle hint of earthy hops. Overall a solid English brown ale."
World Wide Stout,4,"Super high alcohol content. It tastes good, but it doesn’t really taste great because it is like drinking toasty booze. Fun to try once but not really worth having more thn once or twice a year due to the super high price."
World Wide Stout,4,"Dark brown with a ruby hue and two fat fingers of airy, mocha-colored head. Rocky dissipation fairly quickly settles into wisp and crown.

Big aroma of chocolate, cherry cordials and finger nail polish. Strong umami and shoe leather behind.

Plenty of umami and leather in the taste. A good kiss of chocolate and plum, too. A bit of root beer. Decent alcohol heat. Relatively dry finish.

Slick, oily feel. Light carbonation.

Tasty and complex. 11/1/16 bottling."
World Wide Stout,3.99,2019 version coffee bean variant.
World Wide Stout,3.35,"Everyone of these I’ve tried is way too boozy and boring to occupy the heights of great beer. Not impressed.
S: above average I guess
T: average to above average
Feel: about average for its abv
O: overrated
Pretty sure I have had my last one. Unless someone else is buying, of course."
World Wide Stout,4.24,"Bottled 9/22/16

Well, after having KBBS, the highest rated beer in the world and a heavily adjuncted Stout for review 1000, I figure a classic, no frills Stout is the logical next step. I’ve never had this one fresh, but I’m excited to try it regardless, especially for the Cellaruary thread. Let’s get into it

Pours a muddy dark brown with a finger of tan head that immediately fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

It is pretty wild the complexity a Stout can have without barrel aging; everything speaks for itself without any distraction. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark toast, toffee, earthy bourbon, light roast coffee, and charred oak

I know the age and abv definitely play a role in bumping up the complexity and robustness of this beer, but it's an impressive thing regardless. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, black cherry, caramel, charred malt, dark bready malt, bourbon, light raisin, and a touch of red wine. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, rich red wine, charred malt, toffee, black cherry, and a touch of acidic coffee

A full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a somewhat hot beer. Finishes off dry with a lightly tart fruitiness

This is solid stuff right here. I really can't believe I waited this long to try it. A far cry from the KBBS I had yesterday for review 1000, but a wonderful beer in its own right. Hopefully I can get a fresher bottle next time"
World Wide Stout,4.19,"This is the highest abv beer I've ever actually enjoyed. Drank way too much of it when it was on tap locally! Somehow, impressively keeps the booziness minimal while bringing all the right stout characteristics forward. Impressive."
World Wide Stout,4.18,"2016 bottle, cracked open in 2022.

A - Pours opaque, black with brown highlights. Minimal light tan head. Fades to a pencil thin line around the glass, no lacing.

S - A big nose of alcohol warmth, boozy and bourbon-like, vanilla and malts, roasted up nice.

T - Follows the nose, with a fat malty open, chocolate and dark fruits, vanilla and a subtly bitter finish.

M - This is such a big beer, not heavy for it, and more drinkable than I expected. Warm, minimal carbonation.

O - Superb. This is not my favorite type of stout. But incredibly well built. Great example of what can be done."
World Wide Stout,3.75,"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Black colour. Intense aroma of sweet malts, roasted barley, leather, liquorice and oak. Very sweet, alcoholic and roasty flavour with notes of molasses. Interesting, but overdone."
World Wide Stout,4.52,"This beer has always been good, quite good. A couple times great. What I've found is that it varies quite a bit with batch and age. The bones are consistent, but the body and the smooth are the characteristics that are the most different. Expensive and not always easy to get."
World Wide Stout,4.5,"Bottle 4/23/19. I would have aged this longer but I was really curious to try it since I am sampling several stouts this winter. Very dark in appearance, as one would expect. Very strong roasty smell of boozy vanilla. Very intense flavor with some vanilla, hints of chocolate and overall sweetness. I miss some complexity in the flavor in comparison to other stouts I have sampled. There is no doubt it has a boozy presence, is quite smooth and is really enjoyable. I agree with others who said it is a liquor among beers, and that splitting a bottle with someone is really perfect!"
World Wide Stout,4.49,"Opaque black color, huge alcohol aroma and flavor, sweet flavor, but by no means cloying, long warm finish. The alcohol in this beer overwhelms the tastebuds to the point that the stout character is not detectable. But it's really good!"
World Wide Stout,4.53,"My 12oz bottle is at least two years old according to the store. (Actually 2016 - so 5 yo )

Pours pitch black with a short lived tan head which ends as lacing.

Smells of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and alcohol. Tastes of chocolate, coffee and raisins. Slightly bitter finish mostly from the coffee. A lot of alcoholic warmth at the end of a sip as well.

Full body with light carbonation. Lush syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a liqueur among beers!"
World Wide Stout,3.26,"12oz bottle, obcenely expensive, 3 years old

Almost black, cola edge, not much (if any) foam to speak of, smells like coffee beans, hops, and paint varnish. Very bitter and sweet, the coffee is bitter and sweet, the hops are bitter, the malt is honey-like in flavor and feel and sweetness (i.e. pure sugar). If I can describe the taste in cave-man terms - ""chocolate sweet, malty, then bitter coffee alcohol burn"".

This is a big, thick, chewy beer, and it hides the 18% astonishingly well, actually able to fold the ""woody"" alcohol flavor back into the rest of the attack on your taste buds: coffee, chocolate, honey, and all the sweet malt duking it out on the sweet/bitter battlewargrounds, making a mess all over your tastebuds"
World Wide Stout,4.07,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The date on the bottle reads 09/22/16 - 4.5 years old.

A: The beer is pure black with a brown head that surprisingly built up to about 1.5 foamy fingers and stuck around a bit. No light coming through at all, even directly to light. A serious looking beer.

S: A lot going on here, but much of it is kind of buried beneath a strong, hot boozy aroma. Bourbon and port mostly. Dark fruits like plum and raisin, medicinal cherry. A hint of vanilla, roasted malt. This is a complex aroma, but a bit heavy on the alcohol.

T: Vanilla, roasted character. Dark fruit in the mid-palate. Finishes very heavy on the port alcohol character. Hard to unpack a lot of the flavors in here due to the heavy alcohol content.

F: A bit oily and coating, but burns a bit going down and when held in the mouth.

Overall: There is a lot of good in here, but it is buried under a ton of alcohol. On an experimental level, that's kind of the point, and I'd like to revisit this after a few more years to see how that continues to mellow out. This was a good experience, a lot to unpack, but really a one off for me unless I can find a really old one, and cheaply."
2XIPA,4,Totally reasonable imperial IPA to have with dinner. Nothing special but not bad either.
2XIPA,4.04,"Clear light amber color with a decent and lasting foamy white head, some nice lacing.
The aroma is grapefruit, pine and hints of caramel.
The taste is also grapefruit and pine resin followed by light caramel malt. The finish is somewhat dry with lingering pine and a hint of alcohol.
The body is medium, smooth, good carbonation.
Altogether this a modest but fairly well balanced and tasty brew. An excellent imperial IPA."
2XIPA,3.84,Drank from a can a PNC Park. Hard to give a fair evaluation. Love to find a can to take home and pour to a pub glass.
2XIPA,2.92,"Purchased as part of a 15-can variety pack from Sam's Club for $16.89. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Burnt orange with a slight haze. A one-finger off-white head pours with it; disappears rather quick. Lacing isn't too terrible.
S - Candied grapefruit peel, pine resin, and some grassiness. Citron presence is strong, but hidden behind the pine. A bit of ethanol on the nose.
T - While I am aware of the citron and grapefruit presence, the bitter pine tar flavors are a bit overwhelming here. Definitely on the bitter side of things - with a side of earthy wheat.
F - Medium-full in body, with low carbonation. Ethanol burn becomes more intense towards the end of the glass. Filling.
O - An unfortunately average DIPA. While I fully understand the angle here, the intense bitterness isn't justified here. The citrus notes that were supposed to be the star here was covered up by a surge of pine and ethanol - especially towards the end. I'll be completely honest - I won't be getting this one again. For those hop bomb lovers out there, even this may be too much for you. It's worth a try, though."
2XIPA,4.56,19.2 ounce can. Bright CLEAR beautiful copper with lasting rocky head and lace. Orange mango aroma with a hint of honey and pine. Medium sweet grainy honey and not too peachy fruity. Medium citrus bitterness and some pine to clean everything up. Nice carbo medium-heavy body. Fucking excellent.
2XIPA,3.54,And with the final one from the mix pack (I saved the flagship for last) these are way too sweet. IPA shouldn't remind me of candy. The ABV isn't that high either. These are a complete miss for me unsurprisingly. They're not bad or undrinkable but yeah.
2XIPA,3.34,"Clear gold with a white head, great retention, rings of lace
Grapefruit and tangerine aroma
Grapefruit and pine flavor, a bit of alcohol, long bitter finish
Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation, a little hot
Too much alcohol for a 8.2% beer"
2XIPA,2.7,"12oz can with a big smudged date on the bottom

Looks like a movie beer, very slight cloudiness with a nice cap of foam that sticks around. At least it isn't riding the hazy train, I'm going off the rails with these hazy grain (IPAs). Smells like earth, pine and caramel malts. Drinks a little slick and feels higher than the 8.2% listed, but a well-balanced IPA nonetheless; read: malt forward to most. Grapefruit rind, fresh grass, fresh grass that costs $20 a gram (also known as WEED, DOOD), and also a pine tart finish

It's good but nothing worth seeking out. As far as hops, the bill here could pass as a pale ale or even a lager... I imagine they are cutting costs and hoping no one notices. Maybe some will like a pale ale that happens to be 8.2% - I think it's kinda lame"
2XIPA,4.08,"Beautiful, clear and golden body; nice slow rising carbonation; thick and billowy white head with excellent retention. Big aroma of mild caramel interspersed with spicy, pungent hoppiness; a touch of pine resin. Sweet and peppery flavor; caramel again; anise. Heavy body; chewy residual sugars; mild coarseness; semi-dry overall.

This is sample was a bit dated (bottle best by date: 05/06/21), yet it still has a fine balanced and depth going for it. It may be a bit sweet in the taste and mouthfeel, but how much the age of the beer may play a factor in this, I don't know. Still, I like it and would love to try it again."
2XIPA,3.8,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar,Stavanger. ABV is 8.2%. Golden colour, moderate white head. Nice aroma of citrussy American hops. Distinct flavour of citrussy and resinous American hops, fairly dry. Light bodied for its strength. Dangerously drinkable. Oh dear, was the bottle empty already?"
2XIPA,3.77,"Pours a golden color, but clear, not hazy. Very strong pine resin on the nose with malt in the back. Taste is powerful hops and pine, a bit of sour malt. Bitter, lingering aftertaste. I'm just not getting the citrus a lot of others are talking about, and I wish I did. This is all strong, sour pine to me. Make it your last of the night because it's going to be hard to get a neutral palate back afterward."
2XIPA,3.09,The taste of alcohol was noticeable from the first sip. It took me some time to get past it. Some citrus flavor but more subdued in comparison to other IPA’s.
Centennial IPA,3.18,"Looks hazy copperish in color. Smells hoppy with a mix of other scents including, blueberry, lemon, evergreen/pine, raspberry, and dill. Something in the smell reminds me of deli style dill pickles. Taste is lemon and grapefruit, hops and pine. While not over bitter, the bitterness does have a long finish. A fine beer."
Centennial IPA,4.23,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 3/30/22), into a pint glass. A hazy copper color with a 2 finger high off white head with visible carbonation that left lots of lacing. A strong hop presence to the nose with an earthy maltiness below. Bitterness in flavor from start to finish with the malts also well represented, very well balanced. Mouth is a wee bit syrupy and medium to full bodied. A fine go to when undecided about what to have."
Centennial IPA,4.99,"I think this is my favorite IPA out of dozens of others that I've tried. I absolutely love the piney smell and taste of centennial hops. This IPA has a perfect malt balance to the ABV percentage and leaves a slight stickiness on your lips. There is nothing wrong with this beer and I've only had this beer out of a 19.2 fluid ounce can and is only sold as singles in only one liquor store out of the 3 we have here in Uvalde, Tx. and all 3 of them suck bad compared to liquor stores in much larger cities but I sure would like to try this beer out of a bottle. Cans tend to effect the flavor of any beverage. Anyway that's my take on this IPA because in my book it's a masterpiece and hats off to the brewers that put it together and made it happen. I read a few really negative reviews that I don't understand but it's possible they picked up some that have gotten hot and then cooled off no telling how many times. I think they should give it a second chance and change their reviews accordingly to their 2nd experience with it. It deserves a higher overall rating than it does for a beer with it's amount of character. I hope this beer never disappears. Hope my review helps others that are looking to try something new and enjoyable in the IPA realm of the craft beer world because this one might just make you cream in your jeans. Be careful!"
Centennial IPA,3.81,Prefer their All Day IPA but for $16 a 15 pack you can’t beat it.
Centennial IPA,4.17,From a tallboy can. Amber color with an inch or so of fluffy beige head. Smells of pine. Medium body and sticky feel. Roasted malt and piney hops. Nicely balanced.
Centennial IPA,3.92,"Another back of the cooler find at the local beer store. Parts of the labels are torn and smudged but the price was right at one dollar. Took a chance and I think I lucked out.

Poured into a clear glass and it produced a reddish-brown color with a tan-like head. The smell was of hops and possibly a pine. The taste is a pleasant hop bitterness. All in all, it was a good decision."
Centennial IPA,3.55,"Bought a 15-apck cans $15.99 Target
82 days old
Smell of citrus, pine
Hazy reddish-amber color
Medium mouthfeel
Medium carbonation
Taste of malt, grapefruit, oranges, some bitterness, alcohol aftertaste. Seems a little thin in the middle.
Overall ok. Not bad for the price."
Centennial IPA,3.92,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed glass. Light copper in color, slightly cloudy, and one-finger head with moderate lacing.

Smell - a healthy balance of grassy hops and malts, with some honey-like sweet undertones.

Taste - malty sweetness to start, then a rush of floral/grassy hoppy notes accompanied by light to moderate bitterness. the balance is delicate: nothing particularly stands out, but nothing is subdued. finish is slightly sweet with just a tad bit of warmness.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderately boozy at 7.2% ABV.

Overall - an old school American IPA, with excellent balance between malts and hops that gets the best of both worlds."
Centennial IPA,4.58,"My favorite beer! Have always enjoyed bitter, and this beer has it in spades (65 IBU), but it's not too much. Has replaced Saranac Legacy, another very good IPA, as my favorite; Founder's Centennial is now my go to. Has a strong level of alcohol (7.2%) without being too strong. Beautiful copper color, great head, smell, taste, and feel. Also, readily available in my area (upstate NY) at reasonable prices. What's not to love?"
Centennial IPA,4.55,"Very full flavored ipa. Rich Ale flavors. Not sure how to describe it other than a warm flavor, which is excellent. It’s extremely refreshing and has top tier flavor."
Centennial IPA,4.39,"Mix between a two hearted ale and an all day ipa. Starts with a floral malty sweetness with a hint of pine, malty mellow middle, finishes with a floral piney bittersweet finish. Excellent and I’m not usually big on IPAs."
Centennial IPA,3.98,"Hoppy IPA. Similar to 2 Hearted in its bitter finish. Perfect hoppy beer that is very cheap (near me) to put into rotation,"
Centennial IPA,4.26,Liked it overall but this beer fizzes out every time when I open the can no matter what the temperature of the beer. Have to put the mug in the sink and open it over it. Still manage to lost beer as it basically explodes into the glass. No wonder it came in a 15 pack because by the time I’m done it will have really only been a 12er due to the foamed up lost beer.
Centennial IPA,4.5,"Featuring one of my favorite hops varietals, this rich amber drink offers a crisp, slightly sour bite at the front, that settles into an earthy straw-like exhale...the later more pronounced as it warms. Just enough bread on the bottom to balance this act with magnificence. A King's drink, indeed."
Centennial IPA,4.84,"I love this beer. i play the field, but always come home to this. A lovely clear copper color, fruity but not overwhelming smell, a bit of the oily texture that an IPA should have, and a perfect balance between malt and hops. And it certainly doesn't hurt that it's widely available in my area and quite inexpensive (15 12-ounce cans for about $18)."
Centennial IPA,3.41,"This beer looks nice and smells nice when pouring, but has a bitter taste on first sip and the aftertaste is even more bitter. It is one of the least enjoyable IPA's I've had. The taste is what I describe as a ""burnt"" hop taste. Old and bitter and sour. If you really enjoy a bitter and sour IPA, this one is for you. Not for me."
Centennial IPA,4.05,Excellent beer. Thin mouthfeel with hints of orange and grapefruit. It's is a relatively subdued IPA but still great.
Centennial IPA,4.38,"Pours a hazy copper with an eggshell colored head that leaves gobs of lacing behind. Huge aroma of pine, grapefruit and citrus. Flavors follow, with smome malty sweetness, medium bodied, great carbonation. This is a beer I always keep in the fridge."
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.25,"On tap. Tan head. Black color.

Henna double rainbow.

Strawberry up front and all around. Vanilla and chocolate mix in. Barrels a little subdue here but show in the finish with some warming bourbon. Really solid neopolitan ice cream beer."
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.54,2018 vintage
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,5,"I remember waiting in line for this on the Prairie Path. So Thick, so tasty. You have to let it warm up to get the Strawberry, then it's truly delicious."
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.46,"Had on tap. Jet black viscous body with a tiny tan foam ring. Smell has strong strawberry and vanilla with supporting chocolate, bourbon and marshmallow. Taste really does capture the creamy flavoring of neapolitan ice cream with the strawberry and vanilla intermingling with the base chocolate BA stout, has supporting wood and bourbon heat from barrel on the finish. My one qualm is when it warms the strawberry starts to taste like mentos and dominate more. Feel is cool, smooth, thick, sticky, and has kisses of booze heat, but as it warms it start to get a little more astringent."
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.62,"Glossy black with a thin dark tan head settling to a persistent ring.

The first sip comes with two competing forces of marshmallow and spicy barrel. The barrel almost has a cinnamon hint to it at first, but not quite. Then creamy strawberry glides in, and is just present enough to help develop that distinct Neapolitan flavor. It's fresh, seedy and mildly fruity, while the base stout is chocolatey.

The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel. As it warms, licorice, date, nougat and fudge massage the palate further into a pastry coma. It's absolutely delicious and delectable, but much easier drinking than all this decadence might sound."
Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,4.54,"L: Pours jet black, almost no head.
S: Strawberry forward then chocolate.
T: All strawberries and chocolate. Very little barrel or vanilla.
F: Thick and chewy.
O: Delicious."
Green,4.08,"Like their other beers, overhyped and boring. If you don't like hops, this is the IPA for you -- just like most of the other Tree House beers. You have to go double or better to get flavor."
Green,4.63,I had 1 beer about a week after canning and it was pretty bright. After week 2 the hops got sweeter the body got thicker. Tasted even better. Than before.
Green,4.34,"Tree House Brewing Co. ""Green""

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.
Review #7,968"
Green,4.17,"Gorgeous pastel body; yellow-orange appearance; huge head, dense and creamy texture, rocky and white. Peach, pineapple and mango aroma; faint notes of oats and biscuit. Citrus-forward flavor with a sharp, phenol and alcohol bitterness; biscuit-like malt undertone. Heavy body; velvety; juiciness cut with a strong boozy dryness.

If you like New England style India pale ales and sharp, spiky bitterness, this is the beer for you.

Pouring temperature: 47 °F; canning data: DRINK SOME GREEN THIS ST. PATRICK'S DAY 03/14/22"
Green,4.29,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits. Mainly orange and tangerine. Hints of mango and pineapple.

Taste: Also orange, tangerine, mango and pineapple. White grapes and lime are there, too. Low sweetness, medium bitterness.

Feel: Smooth and juicy. Very dry finish.

Overall: With Very Green and Very Gggreennn being two of my absolute favorites from Tree House, I was a bit disappointed by this one. No question it's a great beer, but I was just expecting more of the complexity of its siblings. However, it's a fresh and crushable beer and drinks very smoothly."
Green,4.34,"Hazy shades of yellow with a finger of white foam and lacing abounding. Dank and piney hops give off a cornucopia of fruits: clementine, grapefruit, lime, mango and guava. Taste has powerful bitterness from the pine forward hops, citrus pith, pineapple rind, lime, and melon rind. Feel has mild oxidation with the intense hops, mild juiciness is pleasant and cooling, body is a little thin. A good hop bomb, but not the 63rd best beer in the world"
Green,4.39,"The can pour is an opaque yellow-orange with a 3 cm white foam cap and a fruity nose punch. Orange, mango are most prominent. The flavor follows the nose with those fruits over malt. The hop flavors persist as waves. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth.
This one is great."
Green,4.19,"Milkshake cloudy with a lighter gold color. Moderate sized head which recedes slowly and in a rocky fashion. Fine lacing that nearly coats the glass.

Strong weedy aroma, reminiscent of freshly grounded hop cones. Mild alcohol in the back.

This fits into the extreme category. The flavor is quickly dominated by a total hop explosion, The biting sensation lasts through the long aftertaste. The body and carbonation are in the average range. Overall, this beer does what it wishes to do well, but it's outside of my comfort zone."
Green,5,My first THouse beer was this one and the expectation was REAL.
Green,4.28,"can into glass
Bought at brewery.
Canned 8 days prior to review.
Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done."
Green,4.63,"Depp color reminds me of fresh orange juice. Head is very white that allows lacing to caress the glass. The nose is everything the can describes, juicy, sorbet, tangerine. The only downside is the flavors were not as clear to taste as they were to smell. HOWEVER, this is a great, world class beer!!!"
Green,4.38,"Appearance -The beer poured a cloudy orange-yellow color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The typical nose of orange/tangerines was present.

Taste - The profile was loaded with green spicy hops. The citrus notes brought oranges to mind with just a bit of spice. I did not get pineapple as others did, though I searched hard. A overall gritty nature was noted.

Mouthfeel - Viscosity allowed the profile to link with peppery notes clinging tightest.

Overall - Once you have had a Tree House IPA, you will always recognize one."
Green,4.51,"L: Hazy amber color, two finger white head, messy lacing, no visible carbonation.

S: Tropical fruits, hops.

T: Tropical fruits, hops, malts, juicy. Some bitterness on the back end. Nice!

F: Medium bodied, nicely flavored, creamy, smooth.

O: World class NEIPA."
Double Shot,4.44,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours jet black with very dark, but quickly dissipating, head. The nose is intense vanilla, as advertised. Additional notes of coffee, chocolate, marshmallow, and malts. The taste is fantastic. A great mix of vanilla, roasted malts, coffee grounds, and dark chocolate. Some toffee is mixed in there, along with some dark fruit. Wow. Intense indeed. Lovely stout and very happy to have tried it! Mouthfeel is thick and viscous."
Double Shot,4.4,"“Stout season“ stamped on the bottom of the can

Oh man, I’m so happy to be here. I’ve been waiting so long for Tree House to re-brew straight up, OG Double Shot. This has been (and is still) the highest rated American Stout on BA for quite a while, I’ve had it marked as a want for nearly 3 years. So, let’s get into another world class Stout

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

Oh man, the coffee is so forward in the nose, but there’s still a decent anount of that TH Stout-sweetness still. I’m picking up on aromas of spent coffee beans, espresso, chocolate fudge, caramel, toasted nuts, brown sugar, and light raisin

In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character

I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beer"
Double Shot,4.53,"Sent to me by the one and only @ovaltine whose beer prowess is so amazing he can get fresh Tree House stouts in Indiana.
Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.
The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.
The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.
The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.
OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is."

Tree House Brewing
Date: 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights.

Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas.

One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect

The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold.

The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish.

The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover."
Double Shot,4.77,Fantastic.
Double Shot,4.29,"Pours dark and thick, huge mocha foamy head that lingers. Super sweet coffee and chocolate aroma with a touch of boozy Esa to it. Extremely sweet, has a nice coffee flavor, feels like there is a ton of maple syrup in it. Very sweet. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very good beer, but extremely sweet.

Double Shot,4,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Black pour with a small layer of tan foam. A lot of rich, spicy coffee on the nose. Slight vanilla and caramel sweetness. Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.48,"Look - fantastic thick black with a great lasting tan head
Smell - roasty malts with chocolate and a slight coffee
Taste - great chocolate coffee slight roasty malt
Feel - creamy medium full body with a light carb
Overall - fantastic"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.5,"Tasted in a 6 oz sampler glass from draft at Gold Eagle Wine and Spirits on April 3, 2021. Far too many coffee stouts are overwhelmed by the bitter taste of fresh brewed coffee. This is far more subtle and much better as a result."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,3.9,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of roast malts, coffee, exotic woodwork and dark chocolate. Sweet flavour with distinct notes of coffee, vanilla and dark chocolate."
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,4.43,Another tasty variant of a successful beer. Gets better and better as it warms. Nice bitterness but not overpowering so it balances the alcohol and offsets sweetness so that too is not overpowering.
Resin,4.06,"Look...Dark copper brown with white foamy head and a moderately hazyand I believe to be a more of the traditional IPA look
Smell...not unpleasant but feint hop citrus with bitter dank smell of grass lemon
Taste...Bitter dank piney hop,.. fruity in the middle to a juice bitter dry. Explosive hoppy fruity with a good balance
Feel...never a thick phase in this beer. A slick juicy with adequate carbonation
Overall...This is an excellent beer that I recommend highly. This is an excellent Imperial IPA that many should try and decide for themseves"
Resin,4.14,"This is a thin but tall 12oz. can poured into the Six Point pint glass. This ale is somewhat hazy, has an orange glow, with medium carbonation, the head is white, one finger, that quickly surrendered to a thin solid cap.
The aroma is noticeable from a distance, a pleasant sweet citrus!, I am surprised that I can pick up a light bread malt under the citrus
The flavor is sweet orange citrus giving way to some pine hops that I am certain will bring you to pucker for a second. The bitterness does not overpower the sweetness for long allowing one to enjoy the ale.
This brew has a 9.1 ABV, but the alcohol is hidden perfectly behind the flavor, there is not an alcohol bite or any noticeable heat.
Resin is a pleasant surprise! I was certain it would be overly bitter with an alcohol burn. The bitterness is very much present, but does not destroy the great flavor of this DIPA!!"
Resin,4.17,"“Resin” is the perfect name for this outstanding, widely available DIPA. Just enough of everything an IPA Guy wants.
Best I’ve ever had? No.,. but it is my every day 7:00 refreshing starter. And a regular in the beach cooler too.
Damn good.,."
Resin,4.84,"Resin has a medium, spongy, off-white head and a semi-clear, translucent, bubbly orange appearance, with moderate lacing. The aroma is of hop oils and white bread. The taste is very bitter, but not harsh, and sweet, with white bread crust and some fruit. Resin has a medium body and a dry finish.

RJT"
Resin,4.45,Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold orange with a big thick rocky persistent head. Great smell- resinous and almost a sharp bright piney character. Some citrus too. Sort of a rounded bitterness up front which persists throughout and lingers through the finish. Resinous and piney in the middle. A little bit of a caramel malt mixes in. Full bodied. Very good double IPA.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Here we have another beer that I'm sure I've reviewed before but somehow went missing. It's poured a hazy amber colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The aroma is resinous - duh! - piney, delicately citrusy, and lightly floral. On to the taste... very much the same. The malt is grainy and lightly biscuity. The hops are floral, a touch grassy, and fruity with apple, orange, lemon, and grapefruit. There's probably more there as well! It's got a solid bitterness at a listed 103 IBUs but it doesn't come off nearly as bitter given the amount of malt that's there. It's a very nice blend between sweetish and biscuity malt and a variety of hop notes. The alcohol is apparent but not overly clear, and in combination with the bitterness and a little bit of acidic ""hop bite"" it finishes mainly dry with some grassy, resinous, and floral hops lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp. All in all this is a solid kind of old school double IPA that shouldn't be ignored. There are bigger, brighter, and brasher IPAs out there but this is a feel good, fall back version. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that this bitch clocks in at a whopping 9.1% ABV so you should probably slate it for later in the night.
Review #7,974"
Resin,3.95,"Looks promising. Smell promising.
Tastes average. Feels average.
Just like a woman looking super hot from behind, only to realize that her face is... meh, not that hot.
You men all know the feeling!"
Resin,4.26,"Packaging-5/5- I'm going to talk about the packaging here for a second. This beer comes in a distinct thin bullet can with a powdery green tint and golden/rusty orange embroidered sign on the front. The design is great and it really does make this beer stand out from the others. It has a distinct classic and weathered look that's oddly memorable and visually represents what this beer is, or is trying to, perceive. Looks great.

L-Pours a lively one finger headed ale with a finger and a half head and a golden amber-ish color. Subtle bubbles are there as well.
S-Smells like a very well crafted standard imperial IPA. Malty front with some hints of butterscotch and molasses. Piney, and earthy hop resin is there. Also, in some way, I almost get a candy-like Sweet Tart aroma. Smells great.
T-Not bad on the flavor. Malty sweet upfront with a bitter bite at the end. Subdued enough to invite other flavors as well. There is definitely some mandarine orange here, with a hint of grapefruit.
F-A medium bodied, juicy mouthfeel with a dry and refreshing finish.
O-Quite the experience. From the can to the finish I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It's hard to come by an imperial IPA that is made so well and is so drinkable. Glad I got to try this!"
Resin,4.31,"Such a pretty, orange/rusty colour in the glass with a bright, white, persistent head.

This can is reasonably old so aroma is restrained. There's some caramel and pine and a little bit of orange peel.

The flavour though... Oh my, the flavour. This beer is proudly IPA, even with age on the can. There's piney, resinous notes, some diesel and dankness that has taken over from where I would have expected fruitbowl citrus in a younger beer, but it still tastes fantastic. It's no longer able to hide its alcohol but it's only adding to the pleasure of the newly evolved whole that this beer has become.

Can't wait to taste it fresh!

Cheers"
Resin,3.97,"Looks fantastic for the style. Pours a beautiful, cloudy golden hue with a nice two finger white head which dissipates to leave a sticky white lace as it recedes. Smells fruity and hoppy. Slight citrus, pine, hops, and something l can't quite put my nose on, floral, but it's pleasant. I like it. Taste is slightly citrusy, floral, piny, hoppy. Great flavors that come togethet nicely, but a bit overcomplicated for my taste. Really love the unknown floral type flavor though. So faint, but it's there. Feel is great from start to finish. Medium carbonation turns slightly creamy towards the end. Overall, a fine brew that hides the 9.1% abv well. 10.99 for a sixer. Not terrible at all. Glad l grabbed em."
Resin,4.28,"slim can, best by Nov 14, 2021 (oops), into THAT! NE IPA snifter.

Juicy medium orange with a finger of head, no lacing as it recedes.

Aroma of pine, citrus, juicy yeast, spruce, and slight onion.

For being a month out of date, this is still tasting fantastic. Wonderful alcohol citrus notes all over the place, with some more tropical notes following. White grapefruit, mandarin orange, lychee, pineapple, peach, and mango all dance around some oily pine and circus peanut. I'm very impressed.

Feel is carbonated, juicy, slightly resinous but less than you'd think when considering the name, with well hidden alcohol.

Overall, really surprised I'm jamming this one. I thought it'd be a drain pour but there's still some life left and I really like what's here. This is probably my favorite Sixpoint IPA now. Gonna pick up a 6 pack when I encounter it again. Incredible stuff, very impressive. This is the Sixpoint of old times. Damn cheap too.

Resin,3.96,"draught
Medium light gold tinged orange look. Persistent, off-white head. Medium, sweet spiced, medium roast malt aroma, with a bit of a Mandarin orange peel wave. An off dry, medium caramelized malt body, which supports the tangelo peel and a touch of grapefruit peel, as the overriding flavor, which carries to a long finish."
Resin,4.19,"355ml can.
L: Opaque, burnt orange with an off-white, creamy head that leaves arcs of lacing.
S: English toffee.
T: Caramel, overripe citrus and resin. Not too sweet, not too dry.
F: Medium/full body with an oily mouthfeel and some background alcohol heat.
O: An approachable DIPA. Not a hop bomb, not overly boozy (the alcohol is well hidden). The malt really carries this beer. It’s sweet and luscious but not cloying. Could easily drink a few of these but would then fall over, so best not."
Resin,4.34,"10/14/2021- Hazy pale gold with a robust head that leaves a foamy lace as it recedes; Mouthfeel is a little flat, as if it expended all that sparkle to make itself look good. :) I do like the taste; My invalid sniffer finds it neutral-ish; Yes indeed, quite tasty; Well, for that flavor coming in such a good looking beer it really ranks this one up there. And the mouthfeel, its maybe not so bad now that I get used to it. Ooh. Do I have a new favorite? I calculated the Smell score from the average of the other scores. that's right, innit? If I had a sense of smell I bet I would like the way this one smells."
Resin,4.19,"From a slim, tall 12 oz. can into a Perfect Pint glass. Translucent orange color with thick creamy white foam head. Nose of piney hops. I guess resin refers to pine resin, and there’s a bit of that but it’s not a major component. Taste is typical of a good double IPA, lots of hop up front tempered by malt but not too sweet. Also, it’s not a hop bomb. What do we have here then? Perhaps a “well balanced DIPA.” Mouth is slightly viscous/creamy and crisply bubbly.

Overall: I really like this. It’s similar to my favorite DIPA, Dogfish Head’s 90 Minute IPA, but less sweet and possibly more enjoyable. I’ll have to do a head to head comparison sometime. Highly recommended."
Resin,4.33,"after a long day at work, sitting on my porch sipping Sixpoint Resin, wonderful way to end the day. Citrus, tangy, hoppy, refreshing not much else to say, highly enjoyable"
Resin,3.89,"Feels so light for 9%.
Really sneaky. Very balanced."
Resin,4.19,"Medium gold color, mostly clear with one finger off white head, nice lacing. Citrus and lightly sweet malt flavors dominate into the finish. Very clean taste, somewhat soft."
Resin,4.27,"Best by Oct 1 -21 it says on the can bottom.
Golden amber and opaque but not hazy in the light, deeper amber in the shade. A tall sticky white head forms and slumps quickly to a dense ring with drapes of lace.
Smells of wildflowers and conifers supported by a doughy sweetness with hints of ginger and lemon zest.
The flavor is almost weak up front for such a big beer - no flood of tongue heavy sugar that warns of the heft.
Balance is the word - malt and hop bitterness blend well and while I know the 9% is there, the malt depth is as solid as the hop character. Rich, medium bodied caramel is spiced with grassy, piney hop acids and a nutty toasted grain thing goin on making this a tasty swallow-er not a sipper.
The finish is on the dry side with a hint of fruit.
I never like the marketing of beer with terms like ""dank"" and resin since there is nothing reminiscent of cannabis in this beer despite the remote family connection to the hop plant.
BS keywords aside, this is almost as awesome as the first time I had it 10 years or so ago and high on my list of go-to brews when I only want 1."
Resin,5,"On a first date, she picked up five cans or Resin IPA from her residence and we shared them over pizza. We had a wonderful time and I loved the beer. To me, I[m 69 now, so my smell and taste buds are a bit shot, but this was the smoothest and best beer I ever had! I have Michelob Ultra, but the IPA was far superior. I may have to travel 12 or 30 miles for a local seller or maybe ca;; the brewery and take a ride during the week and visit the brewery in NY. I give it 5 stars."
Resin,4.19,"L: Dark yellow, slightly orange color, slight haze

S: Slight pine but with a clean and crisp smell

T: It is a double IPA so you will get lots of hops but they seem balanced and not overpowering. Leave a long bitter sour aftertaste that lets you know you just drank some hoppy beverage.

F: Pretty smooth for a hoppy IPA, long finish.

O: Lots of alcohol and smooth flavor. This one can creep up on you. Not my #1 overall a very good Double IPA"
Pumpkin Ale,4.34,"Nice mellow pumpkin spice taste and mild aroma. Clean finish , no cloying aftertaste!"
Pumpkin Ale,4.25,Pours amber and smells of what you’d expect from a pumpkin ale. Cinnamon pumpkin aromas not sweet as some pumpkins but medium bodied and full. Nice smooth aftertaste. A nice fall pumpkin beer!
Pumpkin Ale,4.21,"Bottled on 7-19-22. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours a glowing auburn with ruby hues and a subtle haze; fluffy light khaki head that falls leaving decent retention and lacing.

The aromas have a decent amount of pumpkin spices leading the way, especially cinnamon sugar. Some caramel and cocoa. Malts are there.

The flavors follow the nose. More cinnamon leading the way. Some nutmeg and ginger coming through. Hints of allspice in the mix. More caramel and cocoa. Moderate sweetness. Lower bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's fluffy, sharp, smooth, and creamy.

This is a great pumpkin ale. This beer has honestly been on my radar for close to 15 years, so it's nice to finally see what the fuss is about! I'd say it lives up to the hype. I really like it."
Pumpkin Ale,3.84,"Bottled 8/11/22; drank 9/2/22 @ the Yarchives.

Mostly opaque brown/orange appearance.

A rough pour yielded a big, noisy khaki head; minimal lace.

Allspice, pumpkin & mild cream notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Pumpkin pie vibes here; if that's not your bag, you won't like it; if it is your bag, you'll like it but it doesn't transcend the genre."
Pumpkin Ale,4.5,"Pours a hazy deep molasses brown with a light tan head that recedes quickly. The brew smells of fall, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla notes. Basically smells like a freshly baked pumpkin pie with some rum added. The taste is complex, semi-sweet, and rich. A pumpkin or sweet potato pie in a glass! The mouthfeel is luxurious and wonderful. This is definitely a top notch beer!!! Great job Schlafly!"
Pumpkin Ale,5,"One of the beers that absolutely defines the season. A pumpkin beer on a level unmatched by any other. A flavor explosion of Cinnamon, nutmeg, spice and pumpkin pie. A must have for a fall masterpiece"
Pumpkin Ale,4,"Somewhat foggy varnished brown with hints of dark red under a dense but short khaki blanket.

On the way out from Great Taste, Schlafly poured me a glass with an all too heavy hand. It's certainly a pumpkin beer, but as is typical, more in the pumpkin-spiced theme than plain roasted, unflavored squash-like gourd. As such, the earthy, fleshy qualities aren't really present, but yep, it's right in line with the ""style,"" and fairly forward of cinnamon. I was just surprised to see I'd never had this one before, but I suppose not too much considering I tend to stay away from fall and winter spice themed beers.

Either way, thanks for allowing me to check this one off the list at a festival so I can remain unburdened with any excess bottles at home. Like I said, while it's fine, it's just another pumpkin beer in a sea of pumpkin beers that just doesn't stand out, even with all the praise it's garnered over the years."
Pumpkin Ale,4,"This really good, it's not as viscerally pumpkin as some others but I like that about it. It's very flavorful and easy to drink. Definitely a great example of the style. I enjoy the subtle sweetness"
Pumpkin Ale,4.09,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. Bottled on 8/17/2021, so this is over 3 1/2 months old. I took this out of the fridge so I am drinking it closer to room temperature.

Look: Pours a very dark amber color, with near clarity and some speckled particulates have settled to the bottom of the glass. Has a half pinky finger of very frothy, small-bubbled beige head with good retention and decent lacing.

Smell: Very nice aromas of spices - ginger, clove, spicy cinnamon, nutmeg. Lovely caramel aroma and subtle vanilla note.
On the nose, the beer has apple cider vibes more than pumpkin pie flavor. Smells nice regardless.

Taste: Yummy. The sweet, malty, bready notes on the nose and up front on the palate are well-balanced on the finish with mild bitterness, spiciness, and dryness. Has nice flavors of molasses, gingerbread, pumpkin pie, and autumn. There is a mild acidity that works well with this here. It's hard to say that I taste pumpkin itself though.

Feel: Perfectly carbonated and has a slightly chewy and creamy mouthfeel. Medium plus body.

Overall: I think that this is a very well-made pumpkin beer. It is malt-forward and the spices are prevalent yet not overpowering. At the same time, I am very satisfied with drinking just one of these and possibly revisiting it again next year."
Pumpkin Ale,4.24,"Clear amber color with a thin head, fair retention.
Aroma has bold spice notes of cinnamon and clove, hints of pumpkin.
Taste follows suit but with full on pumpkin over the mid palate. It has a smooth strong sweetness, nicely balanced with the spices.
Light to medium body and surprisingly easy to drink for a 8% ABV beer.
I am not a big pumpkin fan in general but I would say this tastes like liquid pumpkin pie.
This is a great pumpkin beer!"
Pumpkin Ale,3.6,"Does not taste like 8% abv, alcohol is hidden very well. Very mellow sweetness. The smell is not that strong but the taste is. Tastes just like pumpkin pie. I would buy this again."
Pumpkin Ale,4.03,"I tried this beer as part of a beer food pairing event that Schlafy held at the Double Overtime Grill in Mount Vernon, Illinois. It poured a clear amber with off white head that did not leave much lace. The scent had strong cinnamon notes. The taste was sweet leaning with cinnamon, brown sugar and pumpkin presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer....it was paired with a cheesecake with caramel drizzle and a pumpkin chocolate truffle.....the sweet food helped cut the sweetness of the beer and made it more enjoyable."
Pumpkin Ale,3.9,"I had this on tap at their taproom in St Louis. Is was a good beer like all their others ive had. The smell reminds me of a pumpkin bar, and the flavor has a lot pumpkin spice notes to it. Its not something id want evey day, but if you had it with a thanksgiving dinner or just relaxing in the fall i would say its quite good."
Pumpkin Ale,4.34,"Now this is a damn good pumpkin ale. Beautiful copper pour that held a rich foamy head for a short while. Ample smell notes of squash, cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg rounded out by a hint of burnt sugar. Those notes are all followed through with in the palate. A creamy pumpkin pie explosion but what I really like is that you do get those notes of the squash. The sweetness is there but it's not overwhelming and it's certainly expected. Finishes with all the same notes with little aftertaste. This is a top notch pumpkin ale."
Pumpkin Ale,4,"September 16, 2021 - A clear dark copper color. The head is thin and dissipates quickly to a ring. I like the color but the head is unimpressive; The smell is sweet and fruity, not your usual beer aroma; Sparkly and tasty. The flavor is surprisingly rich and sweet. A very interesting flavor. Mouthfeel is tangy, medium carbonation, better that suggested by the lack of head. I bought the beer because of its high rating, but I was skeptical. Pumpkin? Really? But its good."
Pumpkin Ale,5,"This beer is the epitome of what a Pumpkin beer should be. So many ""pumpkin"" beers out there have little to no actual pumpkin flavors and are dominated by the pumpkin pie spices. This is the only pumpkin beer that has actually tasted like what a pumpkin pie tastes like. I look forward to this release every year."
Pumpkin Ale,3.44,"It taste like dry baking spices and has a simi sweet/dry finish in a good way. Malty and pumpkin baking spices is how I would describe it. Drink it fresh. It is good but not at the level as the Elysian pumpkin beers and St Arnold Pumpkinator for example. I would say it's decent. And for the peeps that say this is one of the best, I bet they haven't tried the others mentioned."
Pumpkin Ale,4.67,"Disclaimer: this is my first fall beer

Served into stemless wine glasses after put in the freezer for 9 minutes, room temp before that.

Look: translucent burnt orange with a hint of red, bone white head pours 2 fingers, dissipates moderately quickly.

Smell: Fall department store. In a good way. Spice heavy with plenty of cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg competing. Pumpkin pie is in there under the spices and occasionally comes to the forefront. Pie crust there as well.

Taste: follows nose with stronger pumpkin. Starts off spice heavy and the pumpkin pie comes through a bit more mid drink and it ends with more spices and pie crust. Sometimes a hint of whipped cream can be detected. Not overly sweet, more spicy if anything.

Feel: a light consistency beer (almost like a cider/wine) but it packs a punch due to the spices. Medium body but the spices make it feel a bit stronger. A bit creamy and refreshing when the pumpkin pie flavor comes through.

Overall: it’s like fall department store in a bottle, but not in a bad way. It really feels like fall and the color matches that sentiment. Can either be a sipper or a change of pace beer during the session. Higher than average abv hidden well, some alcohol comes through but it pairs well with the rest of the flavors and isn’t obnoxious. Very well crafted beer.

Edit: a traditional fall beer at this point"
Pumpkin Ale,4.96,I have tried many pumpkin beer/ales and this is my definitive favorite. The combination of the pumpkin and nutmeg aromas that connect with the taste buds equally delivers a flavor profile that's hard to beat. Top that off with a completely hidden 8% ABV and that makes it much more than a dessert ale.
Pumpkin Ale,4.65,"Pours a deep amber.. Aroma is pumpkin pie/banana bread, cinnamon, nutmeg. Taste falls right in line and slightly creamy. Medium carbonation. Overall, excellent. Right up there with Good Gourd."
Pumpkin Ale,4.4,"Wow can't believe I've never rated this!

My standard for what a Pumpkin Ale should be. Not overly spiced or overly sweet. Lots of good baking spices plus a whole lotta pumpkin and some graham cracker crust too.

Rated to style."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.79,"This is one of the best beers on the planet. My favorite beer is Lou Pepe Kriek, and while of course nothing can replace LPK, this is as close as you’ll find anywhere outside of Brussels.

In the spirit of BA I’m tempted to use a bunch of pretentious adjectives to describe its color, flavor, mouthfeel, etc., but the truth is you really don’t any of that. Just find it."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.6,"This is an excellent Christmas Eve beer. First it has a great color for Christmas and the cherry and warm spice taste is perfect for the holiday.

Bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up. This beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing. Intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. Enjoyed it very much!

Had the latest batch on 6/5/22 from tap at the brewery. The latest version lives up to previous. Detected a bit of rich vanilla as well. Really a great beer."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,3.96,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.41,"Bottled Feb 2019
Consumed 5/9/21

So excited to try this. The be had an Atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever. Upon pouring it, it looks beautiful. Love the color. I’m super disappointed on the nose though. I get a bit of funk and cherrry, but it’s very muted. On the palette though it’s more pronounced. It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though. There’s a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too. A lovely beer overall. Probably not my top 2-3, but worth the word class ratings."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.48,"L:. Pours a bright ruby red with a small pinkish head and no lacing, very pretty beer.

S:. Lots of jammy sweet cherry, cinnamon, and oak, with a tart cherry lingering in the background.

T:. Jammy cherry comes first followed by cinnamon cobbler crust, and then a quite dry tart cherry to contrast and balance it out.

F:. Dry and lower carbonation.

O:. I love the interplay between the two different cherries."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.3,"4.3/5: The first sip disappoints, but afterwards it reveals delightful nuances of tart cherries, cinnamon, graham cracker, and nutmeg"
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.52,"Batch #7 poured from fridge temp on 9/26/2020

Pours a ruby red with a small white head that leaves a ring of lacing.

Nose is of strong sweet and sour cherry, cinnamon, oak, and vanilla, floral cherry.

Taste follows the nose with sweet cherry, cinnamon, mild oak, mild vanilla, cherry blossom, vinegar.

Feel is light/medium body and hits the tip of the tongue with a burst of carb.

Overall, excellent wild that utilizes two great and contrasting cherries that blend well together."
Montmorency Vs Balaton,4.44,"Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited.

500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F.

Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen.

Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake.

Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.

Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class."

Pseudo Sue,4.17,"Look: Pours a creamy, hazy orange reminiscent of an orange Julius. The brew has thick creamy white head. Very Unique.
Smell: The smell is fresh pineapple, hops, and malt.
Taste: Flavor of pineapple, vanilla and malt with a light sweetness and mild hop bite. Refreshing.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth with hop dryness on the back-end."
Pseudo Sue,3.8,"Canned 1/31/22, marked best by 5/31/22."
Pseudo Sue,4.63,"Nice balanced taste, good nose and head. I’ve had this on draft for several weeks now and it’s a go to at my local"
Pseudo Sue,4.24,"From pint can marked PKG01/31/22 13:42:36 BEST BY 05/31/22

Seems almost impossible to get FRESH Toppling Goliath here unfortunately.

Pours into my tulip a peach gold shade with a big fluffy creamy ecru head. Lots of particulates in the beer. Head is long lived and leaves fluffy sheets of lace.

Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.

Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.

Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.

This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh."
Pseudo Sue,5,"This is pure, unfiltered, and unimaginably delicious beer. 16oz can poured into a snifter at 50F. Opaque hop slurry looking like a glass of orange juice. Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue. Overall one of the best beers I have ever had."
Pseudo Sue,4.35,"Pours a thick hazy deep amber with an overflowing foamy head.
Bursting with mango, orange scent, grass with fresh rain.
Taste is a complex mixture of various sweet citruses carried on a malty substrait
So it smells like a hazy, taste like a pale ale.
Medium bodied, quite carbonated., finishes clean."
Pseudo Sue,4.62,Not sure how this is a pale ale with its extremely hazy nature....that being said it's a damn fine beer. World class beer.
Pseudo Sue,4.45,"This second-most popular staple from my hometown brewery is initially something I thought was nothing special, but when I matured, I determined that it has pizazz; not overpowering, but just right. Not the absolute most special, but so extremely satisfying and well-crafted."
Pseudo Sue,4,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.49. PKG on 1/31/2022 with a best buy date of 5/31/2022, so this is just over 3 1/2 months old.

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.

Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.

Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.

Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible."
Pseudo Sue,4.11,"One of the better Pale Ales out there. Has a very nice hazy appearance with light fruity tropical smell. I like the taste of the citra hops, juicy and mango citrusy flavor. It's a little light on the overall flavor punch to me because it's a pale ale at 5.8% but I can see why it's rated so high. Quality brew by Toppling Goliath."
Pseudo Sue,5,Terrific!
Pseudo Sue,4.57,"Very hazy apricot color with moderate white head that retains well and produces some nice lacing. The aroma is citrus, pine resin with possible mango, pineapple and passionfruit notes, very juicy.
The taste is pine resin and grapefruit up front, mellowing into mildly sweet light malt with lots of tropical fruit notes - orange, pineapple, mango, passionfruit. The finish is lingering passionfruit with a return of the pine, very interesting and tasty from start to finish.
The body is medium, moderate carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.
Altogether this is one tasty and enjoyable brew that I would place somewhere between a NEIPA and a pale ale but it is outstanding, whatever. I already want more."
Pseudo Sue,4.16,"Simply put, this is a very nice IPA. It’s single-hop Citra, which is unusual in todays world. It’s hazy, but not extreme. It’s fruity, but not overly fat and sweet. Balance is the right word. I normally don’t line hazy IPAs very much, but this one I actually line a lot. A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too."
Pseudo Sue,4.35,"Pours a hazy gold.

Light and inviting floral and citrus aroma.

It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind.

Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall a great beer. It’s less sharp and more balanced than Zombie Dust or similar Citra APAs, but quite flavorful. And light enough to pair with spicy food.

Poured from a can dated one month ago."
Pseudo Sue,4.7,"Appearance: Cloudy straw orange, fluffy white head, very good retention.

Aroma: Hops forward. Citrus notes of oranges, tangerines. Tropical fruit.

Flavor & aftertaste: Citrusy & tropical fruit hops flavors. Restrained but balancing bitterness. Medium sweetness.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.

Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking."
Pseudo Sue,4.25,"Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA."
Pseudo Sue,4.79,"Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip.

Smells of citrusy hops and a touch of tropical fruits.

Tastes great! Very refreshing.

Mouthfeel is solid. Light carbonation with a nice viscosity.

Overall a solid brew. Haven’t been able to get this in our area until a few years ago and took a long break from reviews. Picked up a 4 pack to try. Worth the wait."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.7,"My first Weihenstephaner, the Dunkel pours a cloudy tea color and has a thick creamy head that looks like a root beer float. The smell is awesome like their hefeweizen and is a bit muted on the fruit aromas. The taste is pure joy. Is close competition to my favorite Franziskaner which isn't readily available lately. The mouthfeel is pure heaven and is just so smooth and sweet, words can explain it's greatness. Overall I will be picking a couple of these up at the store to keep around. Greatness in the bottle. Love at first taste."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,2.48,"I HOPE to revise this review. Banana, toffee and butter are all present in a delicious way, but way too much muted metallic flavor. I'll give it another shot from a different store but its hard to say that this bottle was spoiled in any specific sense."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.01,"Had on tap at rhein haus in Denver

On arrival a fine 1 finger head was present with very nice retention and thick foamy rings of lacing. The body is an extremely hazy caramel amber with lively fine carbonation.


Aroma is strong Weiss esters with a strong banana note. Quite a sweet aroma from the malts as well but any obvious malt smells are covered by the big traditional yeast. Sweet and yeasty.

Taste is much drier than the aroma would suggest with a big hit of yeast up front without a lot of sweetness, but some bright fruity and banana notes, then some nutty almost caramel roasted malts come in. The yeast here has a lot going on, and the malt lends an extra layer to the traditional hefe taste.

Feel is again very dry, but surprisingly drinkable bright and refreshing for how much much flavor is going on here. On the palate it is actually drying, but the finish is relatively long. The epitome of an anytime beer.

Overall this is a pretty fun weisse and Dunkel. Not as big as some craft interpretations, but the yeast is super traditional and the brewery is steeped in history."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.02,"American Wheat Tulip
Look: Semi-hazy brown color, pouring a 1.5 finger tan colored rich foam head. Dissipated into a thin cap
Smell: Toasted wheat, doughy malt, hint molasses, hint of walnuts and bananas as well
Taste: doughy malt followed by a hint of bitterness and toasted wheat. walnut lingers in there, some light baking spice and some bananas. Finish is light with just some toasted cereal grains
Feel: moderate mouthfeel with gentle carbonation and a clean finish
Overall: Its a good introduction beer for dunkelweizens"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.37,"Look: Poured at a slight chilled temperature from a 500 ml glass. Light brown pour but turns darker as the beer sits. A little bit of lacing as the foam dissipates from the beer.
Smell: As soon as this poured I got strong immediate aromas of banana bread - similar to the banana bread beer. Also got notes of slight caramel, toffee, maybe even some fruits in there too. My mouth is already watering!!
Taste: Getting a sweet taste of banana bread (this flavor is the dominant flavor) with hints of caramel molasses and toffee. Nice malty drink!!!
Feel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink.
Overall: I have to say I’m impressed. I had this beer not to cold but it really packed a punch of flavors. Also for the price of $4.50 for a pint - after taxes is a really good deal!!! I’m surprised how affordable this good beer is. I’d say it could be a $6 beer easily."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.67,"Very smooth drinking beer, holds a head well, gives you a warm glow when you finished a half liter bottle."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4,I’m not a fan of the style but even I like this.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.15,"Bottled and purchased from Timperley Village Bargain Booze
Pours a reddish slightly hazy amber type body with thick thick white head
Aroma is toasty breakfast goodness
Flavour is slight rye clove"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,5,I was very lucky to visit the Brewery on my trip to Germany. The beer from tap is great.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.42,"Bottle poured into a snifter

A- Pours a deep amber color with a ruby hue, two-finger foamy white head eventually settles into one-finger with great retention

S- lots of fruity esters on the nose with aromas of overripe banana, figs, raisins, cherries and apple. Undertones of fruit cake, caramel, twizzler candy, clove and cocoa

T- the fruity esters follow the nose up front, with notes of banana, pears, apples, figs and dark cherries. Mid-palate gives malty notes of brown bread, caramel and a hint of chocolate. The finish gives some peppery yeasty notes that adds cloves as well as some phenolic notes. Lingers of wheat, clove and brown bread

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a crisp finish, high drinkability

O- certainly a standard bearer of the style, one of the best"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.61,"0.5L bottle
Bottle Date: 7500 => 13 Dec, 2020
Consumed on: 13-apr-2022
Glass: 0.5L Hefeweizen Vase
Temp at Pour: mid-40s F


Look:
Opaque and cloudy brown (or dark burnished copper). I can't see my finger through the glass, not even the narrow part. Initial 2-finger thick and creamy off-white head. The head dissipates to a 1-finger head of the same quality with good lacing.

Smell:
Ripe banana with hints of citrus. Dark wheat bread. Hints of chocolate or cocoa. Also cloves.

Taste:
Consistent with the nose. Ripe banana and fruits/citrus with more prominent cocoa and fresh bread notes. The cloves mix in well and bite slightly at the end.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy with noticeable carbonation. The body is medium to medium-full

Overall:
An absolutely wonderful Dunkelweizen from a top-notch brewery that I have enjoyed for many a year. It earns its #1 rating, which it has held as long as I can remember. This beer is a must try for anyone who likes Weissbiers."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.67,"Excellent beer rich and creamy pours into the glass nice. Nice to sip and just taste the richness of it slowly. Big malty flavours which I like, rich luxurious good beer at a reasonable price. I got this and a white chimay belgian beer on the same night which was more expensive and I honestly preferred this one. The dark colour and texture of the beer is blissful"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.16,"On tap at Sabatinis early this evening.

Mixed look here. Murky dark amber body. However, the off white head retains very well leaving rings of lacing.

Nice aroma, mix of apple and banana. A little musty.

Tasty beer. Apple and mushy banana. A very light spice hit. Quite sweet but the spice balances it out.

Mouth above medium, finish very clean.

Overall, mild but tasty dunkelweizen. Would certainly have again"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.01,"Pours a monstrous, frothy, slightly cloudy brown, huge foamy head. Snot locker gets banana and clove. Flavors are similar. This is surprisingly good."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,4.56,"From a bottle. Medium brown color with a half inch of foamy cream-colored head. Distinctive clove and banana smell. Medium body and soft, creamy feel. Roasted malt and cloves with a slight bitterness on the finish. Excellent"
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.79,"This is a 120z. can given an aggressive pour into the 20oz. weizen glass. The ale has an orange tint with a thick three finger head. It has settled a little leaving some thick lacing behind. The carbonation is plentiful, offering a pleasant show in this beer.
The aroma is a tart citrus, noticeable instantly upon opening the can. There is a subtle wheat fragrance also.
The taste offers tart citrus with a navel sweetness. The finish is crisp, somewhat bitter, with plenty of sweetness also.
There is something rather smooth feeling here, but the hops hide that a little with the bitterness.
This is a refreshing, complex ale, true to Lagunitas review. For me it was very enjoyable to sample this IPA."

A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.78,"I had this one a long while back but finally trying again after experiencing a great (too?) many IPAs..

Very clear gold with a thin head... very subdued carbonation. Subdued aroma too but get some pine, grapefruit, banana?

I sipped with some hesitation because i remember this one biting me many years before (and i have a mildly difficult time with wheat beers). There is the undeniable ""Lagunitas backbone"" that i detect in all of their beers -- not sure if it's the malt, the water, or what. But it is interesting - the wheat beer side definitely melds well with the IPA side and makes this quite drinkable. I just find it rather unremarkable. Good beer - but it's a one and done for me and I won't go out of my way to find it."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.29,"Been wanting to try this one for a long time, finally broke down and bought some. Poured from can into pint glass a bright gold tone with medium white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is so so, medium citrus note. Taste is balanced with a toasted wheat sense. Feels very smooth with a nice weight in the mouth. Finishes nice and dry. I appreciate most brews from Lagunitas, and I agree that this is some of their best."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,2.42,"Not my kind of beer.
I guess it's ok for the style?"
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.01,I think Lagunitas describes it best: Way smooth and silky with a nice wheatly-esque-ish-ness. A truly unique style featuring a strong hop finish on a silky body. A hoppy pale wheat ale that is great for IPA fans but so smooth that the hefeweizen fans dig it too.
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.85,"It’s one of the better Lagunitas IPAs, which isn’t saying Mitch."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.23,Poured a golden honey looking color with a white head. The smell was of tropical fruits and hops. The taste was pretty smooth with a hint of lemon and/or lime. A very good tasting beer that I've been happy to finally get.
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.81,"L: A deep golden yellow with 1/2 inch white lace.
S: Hint of citrus
T: Well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the underlying the experience.
F: think with a nice bite at the end.
O: smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.56,"I'm not a hoppy guy, but this I can actually drink on occasion. Piney but not as obnoxious (to me) as most, and with a bit of grapefruit flavor, it takes two things I don't like and seemingly cancels them out.Thicker than you expect, and oddly refreshing."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.58,Tastes somewhere between a hazy IPA and a west coast IPA. Like the sweetness of the wheat but I feel like it's missing something. Ended up feeling torn on this one and ended up feeling a bit indifferent. Probably need to go through another six pack to form strong opinion. Would recommend if you like hazy's but want something more bitter than your traditional sweeter hazy.
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.12,"Pours slightly cloudy with one-inch head. Smell oranges, biscuit. Taste is the same; the beer is a bit sweet but satisfying. At $9.99 a six-pack it is great value for a good beer."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.42,"L: A bit darker yellow but all the fizz and bubbles of an average beer. Little head and lace. A bit cloudy.
S: Orange and Grapefruit. Not strong.
M: Chewy and thick with quite a bit of bitter at the side and remainder.
T: Out of the park? If this is a ""wheat based"" IPA, I'm now a fan? I was impressed by how much balance yet how bitter this was. The primary fruitiness flavor doesn't have the ""Juicy Fruit"" of lots of the other similar beers. Like the scent, it is well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the overall experience.
O: It's a great IPA that maybe might be too bitter for some, yet, smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.25,"Bottled 1/19/22; drank 5/11/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through orange/yellow appearance.

A rough pour yielded a nice eggshell head; strong, frothy lace.

Grapefruit & baking soda notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Grapefruit & baking soda flavors.

Tangy & borderline abrasive; not for me, fam."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.77,"Nice golden color with a nice white head.

Nice smell, a mix of pines, hops. Taste is very rich, according to the smell pines, hops, citrics.

A nice rounded beer, will have more of it. Recomended"
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,5,"Nice beer with a Golden color, aroma of exotic hops and woody tobacco finish on the palette. It’s a good beer cheers!"
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.74,4/2022 offered by Bob St. Jean @ State PEO meeting @ Stonewall Jackson
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,3.6,"Very pale, clear gold appearance. Large, white, rocky head. Grapefruity hop aroma. Medium-bodied. Tastes of wheat & hops."
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,4.24,"Look: Nearly clear orange in color with a frothy white head that builds and holds as a lid, slowly receding and leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Pine, oranges, sweetened strawberries, ruby-red grapefruit, wafts of blueberries, sweet bready malt, and gooseberries
Taste: A huge mixed berry blend comes together and starts it off, soon followed by a sweet orange-led citrus hit. Pine and fresh baked bread weave in and out of the picture throughout and closes with berries, malt sweetness, and a light bite
Mouthfeel: Full, quite smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish
Overall: I dig it. This is, and has been for years, my favorite of these folks’ offerings and unlike in my past, probably one of the only ones I still buy on occasion. When this beer is fresh, like this one is, it’s a winner with lots of nice hop flavor/aroma and the wheat malt component gives it a silky mouthfeel that rounds it out and keeps it from being sharp at all. A tasty hoppy pale wheat ale and one of the best, IMO"
Smoked Porter,4.36,"From a large format bottle purchased and consumed on premises at the Alaskan Brewing Public House in Juneau. This beer is probably underrated. Don't let the ""smoke"" deter you from trying this beer. 4.5

A - Pours with a two finger tan head with reddish highlights. Black opaque beer. Excellent lacing. Photo worthy. 4.5

S - Slightly smokiness in the nose. 4.0

T - A nice dry English porter with good burnt bitterness. Smoke is evident but moderate. Faint faint malty sweetness. Dark chocolate but it’s about the bitterness. There’s some depth of taste as well as the beer warms. The smoke swirls with the roasted malts to create a nice flavor. 4.5

MF - Some acrid bitterness on the back of the palate in the finish. 4.25"
Smoked Porter,4.33,"2021 batch. Black body, slight head that clears quickly. Smell is sweet; caramel, smoke, a bit of salt, a hint of marshmallow. Taste is initially sweet; coffee, dark chocolate, quite roasty, with nutty notes, followed by a nice touch of hops to bitter it out. The smokiness is most prominent in the finish, though present throughout, and definitely adds to the experience rather than distracting. Full bodied, quite smooth, and no noticeable alcohol. Overall, this would be a great porter without the smoke, which I think is the reason it’s so popular. Would love to try an older vintage."
Smoked Porter,3.77,"Nice dark brown pour with some reddish highlights, khaki head that fades to a cap leaving some spotty lacing. Snot locker gets some roastedmalts, a bit of coffee and maybe some chocolate. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated. Not something I'd buy again."
Smoked Porter,4,"Pours dark south a light tan two finger head. Some good sheet lace left behind.

Aroma is nice mellow smoke, caramel notes, graham cracker notes, light herbal earthy notes, plus coffee hints.

Taste follows the nose, nice smoked malts, caramel, dark fruits, coffee hints, herbal notes with some hops to balance the malt out.

Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation.

Overall a good smoked brew, guess I was expecting more due to the reputation but that happens sometimes. Still a solid beer."
Smoked Porter,4.5,Highly carbonated. As I uncapped this one for a taste and came back to it days later still effervescent. Dream of this beer during the cold darker months of the year. And not let down by the 2021 version. Cheers!
Smoked Porter,4.35,"A 2016 bottle that's been waiting for the right moment. So how about as the calendar turns from 2021 to 2022?

Pours opaque and black. Plenty of body on this one. Modest head. Outstanding lacing.

Aromas of chocolate, graham cracker, light smoke, dark fruit, herbal notes, and earth.

The flavors are incredibly melded. There is a sweet side to this--chocolate, graham cracker, and espresso coffee trending to dark fruit and herbs on the front end. But then a savory flavor washes in--well incorporated smoky and meaty notes with some brine. And then earthy hopping at the finish. Incredibly balanced.

Medium-full bodied. Delivers a remarkably drying finish. Extremely smooth.

Five-plus years of aging did nothing but good for this brew. Top-notch."
Smoked Porter,3.53,"650 ml bottle, 2012 vintage, kindly shared by abemorsten. Black colour, moderate tan head. Lovely and balanced aroma between the smoked and roast malts. Roasty and smokey flavour too, but here the notes of ""smoked sausage"" come through a bit too strong for my taste."

2012 vintage

Delicious nose: the best kind of mellow, BBQ smoke laid over hints of a solid, chocolaty base porter on the light end of the range for the style.
That carries through to the body - a light, beechwood/hickory-type smoke, not assertive like oak or peat, playing against layered malts that are not especially heavy on the roast or darker notes. As you get used to the smoke, lovely soft honey + biscuit notes come in - the kind of flavor that’d be lost under big espresso and vanilla notes if this were a stout.
Those (and the age, I’m guessing) even start to pull this out of strictly porter parameters into British strong ale/winter warmer territory - a pile of good malts that’ve had a little bit of wood + a lot of time.
Any finishing hops are gone but the IBUs are just enough for balance. Carb level is on the low side, which serves to smooth things out. This is all wrapped in a much-lighter-than-expected body.
A delicate, balanced, mature, and seamless beer that’s way too easy to knock back.
Never had it fresh, but I can only guess that 8 years has done this well.

If Schlenkerla did porters."
Smoked Porter,4.37,just had their 2020 edition - great smokey malt taste - slightly strong but great taste -
Smoked Porter,3.88,"This review is for the 20-9 edition. Dark as used motor oil, virtually head. Nice aroma: dark chocolate, coffee & roasted malts. Taste is slightly salty balanced with bitter & sweet. Flavor the same as implied by the aroma with a nice smoked finish. I’m getting a strong urge for smoked cheese, fish or chicken I’m hungry now! Feel is medium thick & silky smooth but the flatness & lack of alcohol flavor leaves the tongue extremely bored. Overall, a slight disappointment but still very good."
Smoked Porter,4.34,"I picked this up a few years ago out west on vacation as you don't see much Alaskan brewed product here in Maryland. This is the 2017 edition, which was a very good year. Outstanding smoky aroma erupts from the nose, especially as it warms a bit. Wood, molasses, and salt pork sausage are honestly the main players here, set against the standard dark malt background.

One taste reveals why this is so well regarded (and why I lugged it on a plane from the west coast). Big smoke and bittersweet porter flavor with a complex finish and silky smooth texture. Sweet chocolate and coffee in the aftertaste. Worth the wait."
Smoked Porter,4.27,"Look: Opaque and black in the middle of my 20oz nonic pint glass. Translucent around the edges with some burnt sienna and ruby. The head is tightly packed and eventually disappears. Not much lacing as I drink the beer. There is no visible carbonation.

Smell: Intensely aromatic nose. Smokey, smoldering and ashy wood. Roasty, toasty and some kielbasa. Bitter and faintly tart / pithy.

Taste: Smokey. Toasted dark bread. Like the nose I get a lot pithy bitterness too. The beer smells more “meaty” to me than it tastes, but the flavor is present. A pleasantly dry, woody and toasty finish.

Feel: Medium to high level of carbonation. Dry and woody.

Overall: This beer is one of the better smoked beers I’ve had. The level of smokiness and “meaty” flavor is less than Schlenkerla Rauchbiers, but probably more than others I’ve had. If you don’t like smoked beer you will not like this one. If you’re interested in the style it’s a great starting point."
Smoked Porter,2.58,The beer feels great! But it’s too smoky for my liking.
Smoked Porter,4.36,"Nice head, smoke flavor comes through, nice dark color"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.55,"On tap at Peas & Honey.

Pours a hazy golden orange with thick, soft head.

Smell is sweet and fruity with notes of banana, banana candy, cream, orange, cloves and estery yeast.

Taste is rich, creamy and sweet. Notes of banana, banana candy, citrus, white bread, cloves and yeast.

Mouthfeel is thick, smooth and well carbonated.

Overall, an outstanding Weizenbock. ticks all the boxes."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.93,"Poured into hefeweizen glass from 500 mL bottle
Hazy, dark golden with 4 fingers of white head
Smell: Bananas and wheat
Taste: Delicious blend of citrus, bananas, and classic weissbier goodness. The 7.1 ABV is undetectable. The taste of this beer deserves nothing less than 5 out of 5.
Feel: Full-bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: Drinking this cold beer on a hot summer day put a smile on my face. I am looking forward to trying another one."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.47,"featuring primarily malt and yeast, this beer is very creamy. hints of banana and cloves, while definitely not overbearing, are presented alongside a healthy bread like texture that is just a pleasure to drink. festive yet somehow 'everyday'. classic German workmanship!"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.09,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: L9002 (02 Jan, 2019 ?)
Consumed on: 2022-mar-30
ABV: 7.1%
Glass: 0.5L Ayinger Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp: 46 - 48 F


Look:
Opaque golden copper. I can see shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass, but that's it. Initial 2-finger off-white head soon collapses to a thin but consistent cover. Decent lacing.

Smell:
Overripe bananas along with citrus fruits. Wheat bread. Hints of Ceylon cinnamon and kiss of cloves. Wheat ""twang"" on the end.

Taste:
Rich and doughy with fruity notes at the front such as bananas, overripe pears, and a hint of orange marmalade. Ceylon cinnamon and cloves jump right in and keep things balanced and a touch spicy. There is even a perfume or flower note in there. The finish is mildly sweet and rich. The cinnamon and cloves build as more of this tasty ale is consumed.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy with a body on the heavier side of medium.

Overall:
A nice and tasty Helles Weizenbock. Very flavorful. Especially for one this old. Ayinger makes pretty dad-gummed good beers overall and this is no exception. For me, this an excellent springtime and early summer beer. My ratings would most definitely have been higher for a fresher sample."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.18,"Date code: L0224, or August 11, 2020. Shamefully old for this beer to still be on the shelf and my (formerly) well-respected store. I don't have a chance to check dates, since I use their curb-side delivery, but they'll hear from me about this one. It was at the 18 month mark when I bought it. I seriously doubt the brewer places a 18 month best by on their wheat beers.

Heffe-like cloudy haze, an amber-orange body, with a generous amount of rising bubbles to a towering white head that is thick and creamy-looking. As it slowly recedes, it develops an uneven, pitted, rocky surface with a sheet of lacing trailing.

The aroma presents wheat, bread, and banana; again, hefe-like.

The flavor repeats the aspects from the aroma and adds a spiciness to it. (Which when I re-visit the aroma, I now pick up faint clove.) In the middle, a rich and complex fruitiness begins, which carries through to the end. Pome (core) fruits (apple, pear) which interweave with the banana and spices present a rich and complex mix. All of this supported by the fresh-baked breadiness. No bitterness whatsoever. The finish is rich, a bit coating of my mouth, but still on the dry side.

The body is moderate and creamy, smooth feel.

Overall, an excellent wheat bock. I highly recommend it."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.02,"330 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 7.1%. Moderately hazy golden to pale brown colour, moderate to small white head. Strong aroma of over-ripe bananas, also notes of yeast and cloves. Nice wheaty flavour with citrus, banana and cloves. Very refreshing for its strength. Might well buy again."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.68,"Absolutely a world-class beer...

It is spicy and rich and hardy without being overly sweet or filling. The aromas of clove and wheat and yeast... the rich spiciness...

It's a perfect beer for a cool spring or cool fall day.

I absolutely adore this beer...the Germans definitely know what they are doing..."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.25,Big bottle from John’s poured into stein at home. Why have I waited so long? Unfiltered. Like a hefeweizen with less banana/clove and more strength.
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.56,"1 pint can into a tulip glass.

A: Hazy dark golden color with a solid one-finger white head that receded to a thin film.

S: Spicy yeast, bready malt, cloves, figs, and a slight hint of citrus.

T: Complex malt profile, richly layered and perfectly balanced. Pears, apples, perhaps some persimmon comprise the wonderful fruit flavors with just enough spicy wheat in the background. This is a real treat.

F: Medium-full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation, easy-drinking and hides the 7% ABV well.

O: One of the best weizenbocks out there"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.26,"Purchased as a tall bottle from The Blue Door for $5.99. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Hazy gold with a fluffy three-finger eggshell head. Wonderful lacing.
S - Clove. Freshly-baked white bread. Slight buttery note.
T - Not bitter in the slightest, but just barely sweet. Again, those notes of buttery fresh-baked breads and clove stand out the most here. Bubblegum and pear clear the finish.
F - Leaves your mouth and lips sticky. Very easy-to-drink and refreshing, yet filling. It's like drinking a cinnamon roll, sans the cinnamon. Medium-full body with mild carbonation.
O - An incredibly satisfying brew to have with dinner. Perfect balance of flavors, but I would've maybe liked some more of a bitter bite, or at least a dry finish. No complaints in departments not feel-related, though! A fantastic brew, and a must-try."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.44,"Look: Murky orange in color and even my gentle pour brings about a huge, billowing head that holds as a pillow, cratering eventually, and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Cloves, fresh baked wheat bread, bubblegum, banana, and light wafts of ethanol
Taste: Big, bold, and chewy bready malt gains strength as clove weaves in and out of frame. Banana and bubblegum phenolics piggyback on the clove, all while liquid wheat bread hogs the spotlight. Closes with bread along with light bubblegum
Mouthfeel: Full – bordering on chewy, medium-high carbonation, very soft throughout, and minimal felt (tasted) alcohol
Overall: This is outstanding. One of my favorite styles and I had to review one of the O.G.’s as I hadn’t before and it’d been a while since I’d had it. An awesome, well-made, and delicious Weizenbock that while more than just an above- standard-strength Hefe Weissbier, which it is, is as close as you can get to literally like drinking bread. Highly recommended"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.33,"Great example of the style. Not overly wheaty, but balanced. At 7 percent you do taste the strength. Overall an extremely good beer, but not as good as their Octoberfest Marzen or other dunkel beers which are even more outstanding. Great brewery - something about the water they have access to makes this impossible to replicate by American brewers."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.3,"somehow missed this one until now, its fabulous. the fall always makes me thirsty for german beers, even beyond the typical marzens of the season, it sort of reinvigorates me on these styles, and this one is sensational, really as good a weizenbock as ive ever tasted. its unfiltered but still bright on the pour, a wheaty looking pale orange color with a frothy and permanent inch or two of white head, gorgeous, lots of bubbles too. the aroma is spicy from the yeast, white pepper and anise and green banana to me, estery but controlled, still bready and lager-esque, very old world. its earthy from the wheat, dry and baked to me, nutty and from the earth. not real hoppy at all. the flavor is all of this, the yeast drives it but the grain is full and up front, not sweet but not super dry either, it flows really well. minerals come through for sure, the yeast is awesome, and there are major autumnal vibes to this, its even almost squashy, fallen leaves, peppercorns, lots going on but its simple in nature, really wonderful beer. smooth in texture, effervescent on carbonation, and approaching crisp in the finish, its at once refreshing and fully satisfying, and the price is right too. a beer to not be overlooked, of the finest quality, i will pick up another couple of these soon..."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.43,"500ml bottle poured into a goblet

A- pours a hazy muted orange/gold with a one finger foamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind

S- spicy and peppery yeast on the nose with notes of clove, banana and bubble gum. Toasted wheat, ripe pears, green apple. Doughy malt and some peppery phenols close it out

T- fruity and phenolic notes up front give flavors of banana, clove, overripe pears, apples and bubblegum. Mid-palate gives some doughy malt, as well as honey and toasted wheat. The finish is sweet, with notes of citrus peel, pear, spicy yeast and honey

M- medium body with lively carbonation leads to a bubbly mouthfeel that continues into the finish

O- one of the standard bearers of the style"
Ayinger Weizenbock,5,"Pours hazy, bright gold in color with half inch head. Taste is flower, clove, white and dark bread and a touch of banana and white sugar. Medium body, sweet with moderate high carbonation. Another excellent Weizenbock. Need to get more of this. Excellent malty beer."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.44,"a: slightly cloudy dark copper color with 2-3 finger rocky white head

t: awesome ripe pears up front, clove and fresh dough behind that. sweet malts, banana with a touch of earthy hops (not bitter) to round it out

m: solid, medium mouthfeel

o: absolutely awesome beer and one you should seek out"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.76,"Wow. I'm blown away. Almost at a loss for words. This is one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. Come to think of it, it's right up there with the legendary but elusive Augustiner Helles and the liquid perfection that is Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier. Looks like any other Weissbier when you pour it, but truth be told the appearance wasn't what struck. The aroma is heavenly. Divine. It's a deep whiff of fresh buttered pretzels as you walk by a bakery on a cool spring morning. (I'm getting more poetic as I drink this, and at a stiff 7.1% you can see why). I've never smelled anything like it. It's much more Bock than it is Hefe - in fact none of the usual Weissbier esthers are prominent. Instead you get yeast and a sweet, light, doughy malt, and melted butter. Impressively, the taste damn near lives up to the smell. It's perfectly balanced, and in a way a bit simple, but it works. Simple in that there are not many different things going on at once, and the finish pretty much follows the start, except you get the slightest sharpness from the ABV. Hops are subtle to the point of being barely noticeable, which suits my taste just fine. The only reason I don't give it full points for taste is that the deliciously buttery aroma doesn't translate into the taste as strongly as I'd hoped. The feel is beautifully smooth, goes down dangerously easy considering its ABV, and is so velvety smooth and balanced that you'd never peg it at 7.1% in a blind test. Overall this is an exceptionally excellent beer, with a truly beautiful aroma that could make any man get religious."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.5,"Love this brewery, not sure how I missed reviewing this beer.
Bottle neck forces a chugging pour with a large frothy 2 finger head, great retention and soapy lacing, crystal clear tan to golden honey orange color

Nose brings almost a Belgian sweetness, big sweet malt, creamy doughy wheat with lots of vanilla icing, some honey, layered wheat and malts, I think the Belgian aspect comes in with the yeast additions, fruity esters with citrus, orange marmalade cake, dried apricots, banana bread, light peppery phenols,

Taste is rich as well, lots of layered malts and creamy doughy wheat to start, thick cream of wheat like cereal, golden malts, plenty of honey and sweet flavors but not caramelized or overly sweet itself, a hint of a biscuity caramelization almost brochet honey, with some vanilla icing and a bit of vanilla cake batter even, plenty of soft ester fruits, citrus, orange marmalade, a bit of dried stone fruit, juicy ripe banana, banana bread, light phenol spices, touch of bitterness, and light smooth perfumey alcohol, mild sweet finish but not really sticky

Mouth is fuller bod, rich and creamy, soft at the same time, med to lighter frothy carb, smooth alcohol flavor but not much warmth

Overall awesome as expected, really hits the style well"
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.26,"500 ml, L0224, poured into a Weihenstephan elongated bulbous glass. A cloudy orange with a fluffy three finger white head that dissipates to a 3mm lace within minutes. Heavy banana, bubble gum, and yeast on the aroma. The taste is in line, though I also get some faint peppery spice and pumpernickel bread notes. The feel is soft, full, and on the low side of carbonation. Marvelous. A welcome break from IPA overload, and a good classic to revisit."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.43,"Outstanding Weiss beer. Beautiful color, fabulous smell, great taste. An enjoyable beer."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.25,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a medium golden amber with coppery notes and a three finger white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of bready malt, wheat, mixed grain, raisins and a touch of clove. Flavor is bready malt, wheat, raisins, banana, bread dough and clove. Grainy wheat and banana finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I'm sure I've had this before, but never reviewed it. Glad I revisited this, because it is wonderful. Classic flavor for the style, with a great wheat base and expected flavors of banana and clove. There are moments when the flavor reveals some estery character like an unbaked banana bread dough. Delicious flavor progression and really doesn't drink like a 7% beer. I'll be back to visit this one, not to mention this great brewery."
Ayinger Weizenbock,4.18,Had from from 500 mL bottle.
Darkstar November,4.48,"2021 vintage (batch 8). Poured from a 500mL bottle into my snifter.

Opaque, seal brown liquid with a low dun collar. Very fine lacing; fast running legs; poor retention.

Bourbon, molasses, winter spices, baker's chocolate, fresh dates, and roast malt in the nose.

Flavor follows the nose but with significantly more intensity and complexity. Rye and hops blend together with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Long, even, medium-dry finish with hints of loam and char. Faint tobacco, vanilla, and coconut emerge as the ale warms.

Medium bodied, faintly oily, with low but sufficient carbonation.

Bourbon forward with several layers of flavor - one of the better tasting examples of the style."
Darkstar November,4.44,"Appearance - The beer poured a nice black color with dark mocha bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - The barrel aging was evident in the nose with notes of dark chocolate and molasses.

Taste - Coffee was very evident with a Bourbon also being apparent. Molasses sweetness was strikingly noted as well. Dark chocolate round out the finish.

Mouthfeel - With a thick body and low carbonation, the beer had staying power.

Overall - I would not call it elite, but this was good."
Darkstar November,4.3,"Pours pitch black with a finger of tan foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, and caramely malts. It's accentuated by chocolate, vanilla bean, and some mild char, adding sweetness and bitterness, respectively. Big and bold on the nose. Flavor profile leads with more sweetness - vanilla bean, molasses, caramel, and chocolate. Roasty and toasty malts lay underneath, keeping the beer from listing into sugary, and doing their darndest at that. A touch of barrel char at the end insures balance. Mouth feel is thick with a consistent, creamy texture. That creaminess keeps it easy to drink despite the alcohol content or the weight of each sip. Overall, smooth and bold with a focused push of vanilla bean

Draft. Reviewed from notes."
Darkstar November,5,"Pours a deep black color with a thin tan colored head that laces a bit on the way down. Smells of sweet deep roasted malts, a nice rye spice, and some brown sugar/molasses sweetness to it. It's not as sweet as it smells but it is still sweet. Roasted malt body with a nice rye spice mixed with molasses at the end is really nice. Smooth, velvety, perfect amount of carbonation. Bottle Logic knocks it out of the park on this one."
Darkstar November,4.49,"Tasted in a 6 oz tumbler glass from draft at Phase Three Brewing on December 8, 2021."
Darkstar November,4.44,"2019 release. I received this from @2beerdogs. Poured into a snifter. It pours nearly black with a full finger of creamy, medium-mocha lacing with excellent retention considering the alcohol level. On the nose there is roasted malt, char, tobacco smoke, toffee, and a strong scent of bourbon. The taste is considerably sweeter than the smell would indicate. It opens with fudgy chocolate, vanilla, and molasses with hints of dark fruit in the background. The Buffalo Trace bourbon is strong and warming but the overall flavor has a soft quality. Its mouth feel is plush and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and I can really feel the 14.09% ABV. Overall, Darkstar November is a huge Russian Imperial Stout with loads of flavor. It's a great sipper and I'm grateful to have tried it."
Darkstar November,4.42,"L: Jet black color, quarter finger brown head, minimal lacing, no visible carbonation.

S: Chocolate, rye, alcohol.

T: Chocolate, rye, alcohol. Fantastic.

F: Full bodied, full flavored. Smooth.

O: Superb Russian imperial stout."
Darkstar November,4.64,"500 ml bottle, 2020, poured into a tulip

S- Rye, oak, dark chocolate, whiskey, oak, molasses, some vanilla, hints of berries

T- Dark chocolate, rye, whiskey, touch of caramel, some vanilla, molasses, oak, hints of berries.

LOOK: Motor oil black color, small light brown head. excellent retention

AROMA: wow. lots of wood and spice mixed in with wonderful roasted malts. just the right touches of chocolate, vanilla, whiskey.
TASTE: cocoa, rye whiskey flavor (and aroma) makes this special, roasted malt, oak.
FEEL: super smooth, dry spicy finish perfectly whisks away the sweetness.

Another very good stout from Bottle logic.

Darkstar November,4.75,2018 version poured from a bottle into a snifter. I greatly enjoy this beer. Molasses and dry rye spice. Tasty.
Rübæus,4.37,"Got a nitro draft from City Tap in a pint glass with a finger of white nitro head on top. Smells mildly of raspberries. Very pink color. Taste is excellent, only mildly sour, a little sweet, and lots of raspberry flavor. Light bodied with a very creamy nitro texture. Excellent nitro tap."
Rübæus,3.91,"Smurf jizz, not beer."
Rübæus,2.33,This beer takes pink. Strange flavor that is not quite raspberry but looks like pink sparkling wine. Flat with no real head and the second did taste better colder in the bottle instead of a slow pour into a glass. No recommendation here. Try Leinenkugel's® Berry Weiss since it is a better pour.
Rübæus,3.25,"Bottled 11.19.21 11 is my lucky number but 4 month old beer isn’t usually lucky. Work in 12 hours put me in a bad mood so here we go.

L: cranberry juice, low white head. Legit looks like classy cranberry juice.
S: puke berries. Like gross.
T: smooth red berry taste. Actually kind of impressed. No medicine taste just a cranberry taste without the bitterness. Just surprisingly great. For what it is.
F: medium body, low if any carbonation, creamy. Very pleasant.
O: I don’t have much bad to say about it besides the smell. Definitely worth trying, not worth a 2nd try for most people but I bet some people would seriously love this brew. Ladies try this, men, u can live without."
Rübæus,4.5,Probably my favorite beer to date. Love the strong raspberry taste
Rübæus,3.96,Really bright pink. Smells almost like cherry medicine; very floral and fruity. Smells bright and refreshing. Taste is really sweet. Tastes like fresh raspberries. Very little to make you think it’s a beer. Feel is light. Small bubbles and very refreshing.
Rübæus,4.07,"Poured a red-ish weak iced tea color and was topped with a pink (yes, pink) head. Not a lot of lacing.
The aroma was all about the raspberries, but as this is a raspberry ale, that makes perfect sense. They nailed the smell.
The taste, well, follows. Pure raspberry with *just* enough malt presence to keep it from being a hard soda.
Feel is surprisingly viscous - not syrupy but not thin. Really made me slow down and enjoy a bit.
OA, if you like the taste of Raspberries or fruited beers, give this one a try. If you don't, well, don't!"
Rübæus,4,Smells & tastes like raspberries. Well hidden ABV. A good fruit beer.
Rübæus,3.81,Lovely summer beer.
Rübæus,4.02,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 4/19/21, so plenty fresh.

L---Clear, rich red color with a fluffy, light pink head. Head had good retention and left good lacing.

S---Well, raspberries.

T---Still raspberries. But it smells and tastes like real, fresh raspberries. A one trick pony, but it's pretty good at that trick.

F---Light/medium body with good carbonation.

O---A really nice one from a world class brewery. They absolutely hit what they were aiming for."
Rübæus,4,"A: Poured from the 12 oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a dark red color that is clear when held to light. Head is foamy, off-white, and 2 fingers with moderate retention.

S: Sugary raspberry jam with a bit of bread and pie crust to hold it together. Not complex, just fruitiness and a bit of pie. Not that that's a bad thing...

T: A bolder, juicer flavor than I was expecting. This isn't quite in your face but the taste is all raspberry all the way through and has a lot of character. There is a certain something holding it together, so it's not just juice and it's not a sugary mess.

Overall: More elevated and drinkable than I thought. I was picturing a sort of lambic, but this is not tart at all. It has a pleasant juiciness to it, and it feels like a nice summer drink."
Rübæus,4.28,Outstanding beer but you have to get the nitro tap. Bottles and cans do not do this beer justice. Smooth mouthful. Amazing taste.
Rübæus,3.94,"Pours dark pink with an off-white head. Faint fieldberry on the nose. The taste is sweet/tart raspberry with a nice malty background. You can tell that this is real raspberries and not just flavouring. A nice summertime quencher.
June 24 2021"
Rübæus,3.77,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger (also available there on 355 ml bottles). Red colour, thin off-white head. Strong and lovely aroma of ripe raspberries and raspberry flowers. Medium sweet flavour, distinct notes of raspberries throughout, refreshing. Nice fruit beer."
Rübæus,3.81,"Fruity and beery enough in good measure, so if you're gonna drink fruit beer this one is suited to the job. Raspberries properly the flavour the beer, but is maybe not solid enough on the nose. Pale pink, not much by way of a head or lacing. Drink this if you like raspberries. Simple and tasty is what it is about."
Rübæus,3.88,"Clear pour with pink and raspberry tone. Impressive white head with light pink shade. Lacing was good. Aroma was nothing crazy, but with tad hints of raspberry. Most likely due to puree mix. The taste was dominated by raspberry, but not overwhelming. I also tasted tart and malt. Moderate carbonation with light body. Surprising smooth. Only 15 IBU and reasonably priced. Fruit beers are easy to mess up, but the overall balance presented well for me."
Rübæus,3.74,"Raspberry red, not much of a head. Smell is muted— strawberry, apple, a watery softness. Taste follows— raspberry, strawberry, apple, light sourness on the finish. As I drank it, it seemed to get a bit more syrupy. Feel is nice, moderately carbonated.
If I had a sip of this blind I might guess that it was a raspberry soda. It’s good for sure, but I’m left wanting a bit more complexity from it."
Old Ruffian,4.06,"Taken from notes-2019

Pours brown in color with a one-finger foamy off-white head that reduces to a ring. Smells of caramel, toffee, raisin, brown bread, fruit cake, faded piney and citrus hops. Tastes of malty caramel and fruit cake up front, followed by faded piney hops, raisins and figs. Finishes with caramel and faded hops. Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and slightly warming finish"
Old Ruffian,3.88,"1 pint 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.2%. Dark orange to brown colour, hazy. Big and lasting pale orange to beige head. The sweetish aroma has notes of pine, ripe fruits, raisins and molasses. Full and warming mouthfeel. Rich flavour with loads of malty sweetness, notes of raisins, caramel, molasses and udefined fruit, while the high IBU makes itself known towards the end, through a substantial and resinous hoppy bitterness."
Old Ruffian,4,"Nov, '20 bottle aged since 1/28/16: Good nose of sweet dark fruit; Amber hue with tan head & good lace; medium mouthfeel w/ smooth effervescent carbonation; taste is bitter raisins and dank fig/date; dry quenching finish that retains bitter bark notes. For me, I would like to see a bit better balance with sweet to bitter, but my review reflects what the brewery says about their beer."
Old Ruffian,4,"Barley wine bottle share on 1/31. Poured a crimson/ruby red w/ a thin soap like head. Aroma of hops, fairly astringent. The palate was smooth and slickly The flavor was bitter hops followed by sweet citrus and malts..Incredibly good and tasty."
Old Ruffian,4.06,"Vintage 2016

I like most of their yeti imperial stout variants so let's see how their barley wine goes & hopefully the 90 IBU's have mellowed out . The pour is umber brown color into the snifter glass. On the taste i'm getting some hops but they have mellowed out somewhat, some dark cherry, black currant, malts, caramel, pine, & burnt sugar. It's a really good Barleywine & it leave a nice lacing around the glass but I still favor Yeti variants. cheers! A-"
Old Ruffian,4.94,"Pours dark amber to brown. 1/2 inch yellowish tan head. Thick lacing. Moderate carbonation.

Aroma of roasted & caramel malts, oak, molasses, toffee.

Tastes is sweet and bitter. Rye, oak, toffee, vanilla, molasses, dates, whiskey.

One of the best barley wines I've had so far."

Smooth creamy feel, no hint of the alcohol
Overall it aged really well, this was a superb barleywine"
Old Ruffian,4.16,"Chestnut brown with a modest head. Very pretty aroma, caramel covered malt with a hint of hops. Taste is salty bitter & very little of the sweetness promised by its aroma. Complex flavor, hoppy, pine, resin, raisin, malted barley, molasses & a strong pepper finish. Silky smooth & fairly thick, not much alcohol flavor but plenty of numbing effect. Fun to drink & delicious!"
Old Ruffian,4.1,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated Jan 2016 bought in 2019. This was a well aged bottle ! And it aged well.

A great sipping beer with a sweet start and a big bitter hoppy finish. The high alcohol level is well hidden."
Old Ruffian,4.15,"Crystal clear caramel ale, topped with a cream-colored, firm head. Good production, and excellent retention. An absolutely beautiful ale.

Nose is fairly subdued, but you can certainly discern the hop presence.

On the palate, this brew is impressively bitter, with waves of pine, caramel, resin, earth, pepper, and a touch of citrus. This is exactly what an American Barleywine is supposed to represent: hoppy caramel malt soup at it's best."
Old Ruffian,4.29,"Look: It pours medium brown with reddish hues. The head is light brown. Head retention is excellent.

Smell: Strong malty notes the feature caramel and toffee. It also has some raisin and bready background notes.

Taste: It has a strong malty flavor highlighted by caramel and toffee. There are some orange and citrus elements supporting the malt presentation. There are also some floral elements. Alcohol is noticeable, but very smooth.

Feel: It is full bodied with a bittersweet finish. Alcohol warming is very pleasant and smooth.

Overall, this is a good balance between the malt and the hops with the malt being a little more forward."
Old Ruffian,4.45,"Pours a cloudy dark copper color. Smell is caramel, vanilla, raisin. Taste is hops, malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, plum, raisin. Slight fruit. Says it was bottled on January 29, 2015. Ages well. This is an outstanding beer."

Old Ruffian,4.17,"12oz bottled 2/1/16 (2 years ago today) poured into a snifter at fridge temp 10.2% ABV. The beer pours medium brown in color with orange & red highlights. The head is mocha colored and offers some lacing and a nice residual cap. The aroma is burnt sugar, a last bit of fading piney hops and rich malt. The taste is more burnt sugar, with substantial hop bitterness, that mellows into piney, malty heat on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry. Overall, very good American barleywine. I prefer the more subtle English style but this is very nice at this age. It was purchased warm 5 months ago, so it's treatment could have been better."
Bad Boy,4.68,"Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing
Aroma has generous floral and hoppy hints
The taste follows the nose with a very well balanced floral and hoppy flavors
A medium bodied well carbonated beer
A great IPA"
Bad Boy,4.9,"#82, hits on all levels"
Bad Boy,4.5,"From a month-old pint can, pours a very clear deep orange-gold. Smell and taste are very herbal and piney, with a touch of citrus. Bracing bitterness, but not excessively so. A big, unapologetic West Coast IIPA. Fantastic beer."
Bad Boy,3.89,6/28/2019
Bad Boy,3.64,"Nearly clear bright yellow brew with a thin cap of foam. Robust mouthfeel with super-sized malt. Aroma is mango. Flavors of dark orange, even some grapes. Rich and powerful with hot citrus.

Quite alcohol tasting. Boozy, as someone noted. Overall, this is a pretty no-nonsense blast of hops. I have never seen this in the San Diego area, and here it is at a supermarket in San Francisco. From the 22 oz bottle."
Yeti,3.15,"The 9.5% ABV was too high. Don't get me wrong, I love a great buzz as much as the next guy. But my taste buds mostly registered the alcohol flavor which overwhelmed the other flavors in the beer."
Yeti,4.73,"Here’s another one I’m surprised I haven’t reviewed before.

Pours a luscious liquid black, like delicious motor oil. Creamy cocoa cap of foam.
Cocoa and coffee roasty notes come up front on the nose. The sip has a prominent hoppiness that gives it a sharp roast character. Long lingering finish. Opens as it warms. Always reliable. Always delicious."
Yeti,4.24,"Looks dark black, jet black, frothy head that lingers, some very nice lacing. It's a little cool still so there's a bit of haze on the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, toasted malt, licorice, syrup/molasses, maybe some BBQ bark.

Taste follows. Very chewy, thick beer. Not overly sweet, finishes dry and bitter. Actually reminiscent of Storm King. Maybe it's cascade? Anyway, nice easy drinking, bitter option. Good beer. Easily worth the price of admission."
Yeti,4.94,"Poured into a pint glass at about 50 degrees. Black as used motor oil with a khaki 2.5 finger head that reduces down to a nice thick film that lasts. Epic lacing from the top down. Absolutely no light coming through this beer. Smell is heavily roasted coffee and baker's cocoa, with a very slight hoppy funk hidden underneath the malt character. Taste blows me away with rich cocoa and straight coffee with very little sweetness aside from an initial and very short-lived toffee kick, and the hops really add a nice floral punch that ends in a long-lasting bitter hanging on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and fairly heavy, but velvety smooth and the CO2 level is somewhat light, which makes it filling, but not bloating. Alcohol is hidden nicely under all the bitter malt and hop character making this a very nice sipper that really hits the imperial stout bullseye."
Yeti,4.25,"Look: Jet black pour from a 12oz can into a 20 oz cup. A bit of foam risen to the surface. Not much lacing as it goes down.
Smell: The aroma resembles a heavy caramel toasty stout with slight chocolate after hints.
Taste: Heavy roasted chocolate for the initial sip followed by aromas of caramel aftertaste.
Feel: medium to heavy bodied for this one, doesn’t taste like a 9%. It resembles a 6-7% for me. Not to shabby.
Overall: Not bad! I’ve been meaning to try this beer for a while but haven’t had the chance to get it. It’s a once in a lifetime experience so if you can get you’re hand on it I say go for it to at least try. This wasn’t the pick of the crop for me but it doesn’t mean it isn’t for anyone else."
Yeti,4.13,"Very nice lacey head. Smell is sweet— caramel malt, coffee, and a hint of citrus. Taste follows- a pronounced pine hoppiness upfront becomes leather, roasted malt, caramel, and salt, finishing with coffee and chocolate notes. Moderate to high carbonation, and quite masked alcohol. A very nicely balanced, not overly sweet stout. Can’t ask for more than that."
Yeti,2.94,virtually no head on the one I poured
Yeti,4.31,"Stunning pour. Huge thick lacey brown rich head, that just stayed there.

Slight hoppiness on the nose, and in the taste. Not really enough maltiness to break through, but still very enjoyable overall.

A very solid, well priced beer.

This is my number 1 inexpensive beer. Serious beer, and the price just makes it special."
Yeti,4.15,"Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of black coffee, caramel and vanilla. Smooth but bitter at the finish."
Yeti,4.84,"Look: Wo bud. Black with straight up tan sea foam everywhere. Lacing is mesmerizing.

Smell: Hoppy, roasted and sour.

Taste: Ink in beer form. Bitter, dark chocolate, coffee, grass, hint of aspirin. No remorse.

Feel: Medium to full bodied. Carbonation is barely there.

Overall: One of my favorite stouts. Thank you, Great Divide."
Yeti,4.32,From a can dated 5/5/21. Jet black with a quarter inch of dark brown head. Roasted malt smell. Heavier body but very smooth feel. Roasted malts and coffee flavors with a lasting bitter finish. This is great!
Yeti,4.22,"toast, smoke, bread, it's not well rounded or complex, but it's straight to the point"
Yeti,4.24,"12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Canned on 2/3/21.

L---Darkest, impenetrable brown color. Massive light brown head had great retention and left phenomenal lacing.

S---Roasted malts. Coffee, caramel.

T---Follows the nose perfectly, but a little bit stronger..

F---Feels big, although the high ABV is hidden. Well carbonated. A sipper, not a gulper.

O---Just excellent."
Yeti,4.07,"Poured pitch black with a two finger choco malt milkshake head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing. Absolutely beautiful! Nose of roasted malt, molasses, toffee and coffee. Taste follows the nose but is very robust with layering of flavors followed by black licorice, leather and pronounced hop bitterness that lingers for a long finish. Moderate - heavy body and medium carbonation. Dry finish. This is a real sipper with its fullness, pronounced flavor layering and higher ABV that is hidden. I would have scored this higher but the bitterness seems to overwhelm the brew, which I do not believe is characteristic of a well balanced RIS."
Yeti,4.5,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV 9.5%. Pitch black colour, brown head. Lovely aroma of heavily roasted malts, cigar box and leather. Intense roasty flavour with notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and English liquorice. Brilliant stuff!"
Yeti,4.5,"I mean this is solid, since it's imperial I wouldn't recommend if you're not into the higher alcohol realm. This tastes like 5% when it's really 9.5%. Easy drinking im not gonna say I had my mind blown but def real solid.


After trying this more and on tap I still really would keep coming back to it. This is just consistent"
Oerbier,4.29,"Foggy amber color, minimal head. Smell is sweet, with figs, honey, cranberry, oak, and orange peel. Taste is sweet and tart. Upfront caramel and toasted malt quickly becomes tart cranberry, apple, and grape, with hoppy notes and oak. There’s a bit of lingering bread on the finish as well. Feel is a bit chalky, with a nice alcohol presence. Wonderful complexity and balance."
Oerbier,4.24,"11.6 ounce bottled April 2021 (13 months ago) poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves no lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring raspberry, cherry, clove and brown sugar. The taste is semisweet burnt sugar caramel, with additional notes of raspberry and cherry before a mildly earthy, mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. No trace of the ABV in the aroma or taste. Overall, very good."
Oerbier,4.08,"12oz can. No dating information found.
Murky, amber brown colored body. Light tan head. Leaves layered rings of lacing.
Aroma fills the immediate area of the glass. Roasted malts but the wafting smells are an array of dark fruits and yeast esters. Spicy, as in esters.
Taste expresses dark fruits, sweet green apple, a bit of sour wine, and a hint of chocolate. Roasted malts make a base. Goes tart then sweet. Aftertaste is a mix of fruit, spice, and caramel.
Medium mouth feel. Alcohol is quite well hidden but comes through a bit in the nose. Good carbonation.
Not what I expected, even the nose is considerably different from the flavors. There is complexity here."
Oerbier,4.34,"BBE 7/22. 33cl bottle to wine glass.

Look: Pours a lightly reddish opaque brown with a beige fluffy head that dissipates after a while without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Dark red fruits, especially sour cherry. Also red apple and plum. Rather acidic than sweet.

Taste: Notes of sour cherry, plum, raisins, ripe red apples, caramel and brown sugar. Fruity and malty. First tart, then sweet and somehow bitter. A bit alcoholic.

Feel: Not as full as other Belgian dark ales. Rather juicy and quite fresh. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Not the best, but easily one of the most interesting and unique Belgian beers I've had. Very complex and nicely balanced with taste notes you wouldn't expect in one and the same beer. It feels a bit like a melange of the most famous Belgian beer styles. Very good beer with an even better bottle label."
Oerbier,3.67,"L: dark red brown. More brown than red wine, similar to a light Dr.pepper. Minimal head, tan in color.

S: Dark fruit notes. Tartness.

T: dark fruit notes again, prune, raisins, and stone fruit. A little saltiness to it, like a nut brittle. Tart sour fruit.

F: medium-full bodied. Creamy and full mouthfeel, that sour tartness around the mouth.

O: Very dark fruit forward. Decent for the category."
Oerbier,4.2,"Bottle to tulip, Zeno’s Pub, State College, Penna.

L: Reddish-to-brown, with a finger of tan head that fades quickly but leaves a layer behind. Not much lacing.
S: I get bready, maybe some barrel, and a little fruit (plums?)
T: Plums, other stone fruits, some barrel heat, with a spicy finish. As it warms up I get more sweetness.
F: Medium-bodied, dry finish.
O: Outstanding Belgian dark. Everything De Dolle does is great"
Oerbier,4.39,"330 mL bottle purchased at the LCBO about two years ago, ""bottled Oct 2019"" stamped on the cap. Served barely chilled.

Pours clear amber-copper, topped with over a finger of smooth, creamy, beige-coloured head that dissipates within several minutes. A tight collar of creamy suds remains behind, encircling a filmy cap; not much lace initially, but there's deposition as the level drops. Sweet fruitcake notes on the nose - plum, raisin, red grape, brown and candi sugars; hints of cherry and apple, with suggestions of clove spice, ethanol and just a touch of banana bread. Moderately phenolic.

Ooh, this is a nice one. Candi sugar, raisin and plum, with slightly vinous notes of red grape not far behind; more of a toffee/caramelized sugar sweetness later on, with yeasty, phenolic spiciness developing at the finish. Clove, pepper and herbal bitterness, alongside alcohol and a wisp of cinnamon; more dark/orchard fruitiness and sugars persist into the warming aftertaste. Basically full-bodied, with moderately assertive carbonation that prickles the palate, frothing up a bit on the tongue, resulting in a silky-smooth, pillowy texture that suits this style perfectly. A fine sipper, complex and tasty - I'm pretty much at a loss for complaints here.

Final Grade: 4.39, an astounding A grade. After reviewing nothing but quads and BSDAs for a little over a week now - most of which have been pretty darn good - I feel like I'm in a good position to say that Oerbier is one of the best, most unique Belgian dark ales that I've ever experienced. Simply phenomenal, this should be considered a must-try for all BAs, particularly those with an affinity for Belgian stuff - I should've bought way more than three bottles!"
Oerbier,4.06,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Medium copper pour with a sand colored head which dissipates quickly.

S - Brown bread, salted pretzel, slight fruitiness (plums maybe).

T - Tart cider type flavors fading into bready grains and white wine barrel type notes.

F - Crisp, dry, very fine, faint carbonation.

This was not what I was expecting, seems closer to a Flanders. It's very refreshing and drinkable, quite and interesting surprise."
Oerbier,4.22,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9%. The glass fills completely by a huge beige head, and the brown beer appears only slowly. Intense fruity aroma with berry notes, also some oaky, spicy and vinous notes. The flavour has a powerful malty sweetness and intense vinous notes, warming mouthfeel. Notes of oak and berries again. Awesome beer."
Oerbier,4.27,"I like this more than trappist rochefort 10, perhaps comparing the two isn't fair but this one is just a bit crispier, less sweet and more drinkable than the 10 which is a big sweet bastard. Less fig/raisin/dried fruit notes which I prefer, the dryness makes it a notch better than 10."
Oerbier,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark copper brown pour with ruby highlights. Thick foamy off-white head... lasts forever +1 and leaves great lacing.

S: Dark fruit and malts. Belgian sugars.

T.F: Just like it smells. Semi-sweet up front... strong dark fruit. Raisin, fig, plum, and cherry mixed with Belgian candy sugars and light grains. A bit of yeasty goodness... some esters and spice. Silky smooth... creamy with effervescent carbonation. Complex fruit and yeast finish.

O: An outstanding Belgian Strong Dark. Why did I let this sit in the back of my fridge so long? Where can I get more? Important questions to ask."
Oerbier,4.3,"2012 VIintage
11.2oz bottle poured into a tulip

A- pours a deep ruby color with a one-finger creamy light khaki head that has great retention long after the pour and leaves some nice lacing behind

S- aroma is fruity up front with aromas of concord grapes, slightly tart red berries, plum & raisin. Belgian candi sugar, caramelized sugars, toffee, damp basement and peppery yeast close it out

T- Fruity notes follow the nose with flavors of grape juice, raisin, plum, red apples, orange peel and even some strawberry. Mid-palate is malty and sweet with notes of caramelized sugar and molasses. The finish is slightly tart with an almost juicy like grape and red berry flavor, lingers of peppery yeast

M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish

O- surprisingly not much oxidation, there's a tartness that has set in that I don't remember from trying it fresh, still a sold, fruity beer"
Oerbier,4.61,"AROMA - deep rose, stewed/glazed cherry, deep rich caramel malt with slight musty/sour note

FLAVOR - deep caramel and chocolate malt, well -attenuated, low peppery alcohol has a nice perfume character, herbal hop on the mid palate, baked strawberry, dry, earthy finish,

MF - warming, assertive acidity, medium-full bodied and velvety

OVERALL - deeply malty dark beer with fresh spicy character punctuated by huge hits of cooked fruit. Intense and awesome."
Oerbier,4.4,"Aug 2016 bottling.

Large tan head. Caramel brown color.

A lot of figs, molasses, plums, caramel, toffee, red apple skins, and spices.

Full bodied and very flavorful. A beautiful beer."
Oerbier,4.19,Poured from a bottle -opaque dark brown with foamy khaki head leaving lots of foamy/bubbly lacing. Nose is sweet malt and dark stone fruit with some yeasty spicy whiffs. Taste follows more or less with a full mouthfeel and significant carbonation on the finish. Really good.
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.5,"brown-red, foamy, long lasting. dark fruits, cherry, raisins.

typical belgian yeast. also sherry/port wine tastes. creamy/smooth, some acidity.
some spices.
some bitterness in the finish.

overall: many similarities to westy 12, but a bit more toned down, less sweet."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.49,"Pours a firm burgundy color with a little haze to the transparency. A little protein build up floats in the glass. The first 3/4 of the bottle was poured into the glass for this review, with more sediment in the final quarter. Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section. Flavor profile is raisins, toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and almonds. Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft, expansive effervescence that seems to feel bigger at the end than the start. This effect helps create a comforting, full feeling. Overall, some great malt and flavor undertones in both nose and taste. A comfortable blanket of a beer.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 33cl bottle."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.47,"330mL bottle (best by 10/23/2019, so bottled 10/23/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a slightly hazy deep mahogany with minimal head, lots of tiny floaties suspended throughout, steady carbonation rising to the surface.

Aroma is bready and sweet with notes of figs and dates, candi sugar, caramel. Delicate and nicely balanced.

Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex. One thing that stands out here, that I often don’t notice, is the quality of the water—clean and refreshing with a subtle mineral quality, like a cold spring. Caramel, dark stone fruits, Belgian yeast. Some vaguely wintery spice and subtle Old World hops.

Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp, just right.

Overall, and not surprisingly, we have here a truly excellent, world-class dubbel. Maybe one of the best ones I’ve ever had."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.43,"Pours a deep, dark brown coloration with a medium, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and estery fruit and spice, with just a hint of dark fruit and chocolate also coming through. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, chocolate and dark and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, fig, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of licorice and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with notes of estery fruity and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This actually feels very close to their Quadrupel for me, except maybe being not quite as rich, a little more carbonated and just a tad more roasted and bitter. For my personal taste, I probaly prefer it, to be honest. Still, without being quite worth its secondary price, this makes for a very impressive Dubbel that just stands slightly above offering such as Westmalle, St. Bernadus and Chimay due to its richness, balance and above all body and mouthfeel, with the estery character really standing out here."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.59,"Boom! Boom! Boom! Like Northeudge in ‘94 or Tupac shooting a music video, this one shakes, rattles, and rolls! This one is like Barry Bonds on roids…oh wait, he already was.

Get sum."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.48,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.
S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.
T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!
F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers.
O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.
I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK!
330ml bottle BB: [can't find on cap] Bought from a shop in Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.66,"Shared from a bottle with a friend on June 6, 2021.

The pour is mahogany brown with reddish hues under a boisterous, fluffy light tan head.

Lovely malt forward aroma sensations with Belgian spices and Belgian candied sugar.

The body was medium or better and smooth.

The taste is a luscious malt forward sweetness with Belgian candied sugars and the slightest clove and coriander character. Just delightful."
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),4.31,"A relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy, beige colored head with some decent lacing. This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below. Color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge. Aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol.

Taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish. There's a complexity to this that I just can't place, but whatever those tastes are, they're working very well together. For me, the feel really shines. Medium+ bodied, plenty of carbonation but not overdone, and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol. Very well done beer."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.83,"330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 5/26/23, so plenty fresh.

Looks nice in the glass. A glassy pale yellow body with a small white head, shrinking to a ring and covering.

Strong banana, wheat, yeasty aroma.

On tasting, confirms the nose. It's very strong, maybe a little too strong.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish wheat, yeast, and a faint bitter note.

Overall, pretty decent witbier, maybe a bit too strong to be considered refreshing, but a nice enough drink."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.47,My favorite beer. So delicious!
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.84,"As summer comes to an unofficial close this weekend, this is a good time to remember a nice summer time brew. We picked up a pack of Hoegaarden a few weeks ago and enjoyed them in rapid succession on a nice rooftop night. This beer is Allagash and Blue Moon with some balls. Great spice to these suds with lovely orange notes and a real spice kick. Both RC and myself had never had it before and I'm sure it will be revisited soon."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.73,"One of my top beers. It is amazing that something bursting with so much flavor is so inexpensive relatively.

Strong wheat flavors, mixed with something herbal or botanical. Very easy to drink quickly - once I start drinking a bottle it is so delicious and smooth that it does not last long. Cloudy appearance with bits of yeast swirling around."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,3.74,"11.2oz bottle freshest before 28/02/2023 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 4.9% ABV. The beer pours hazy soft yellow in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap. The aroma is mild with coriander, wheat malt and vague citrus peel. The taste is all of that with a nice injection of clove / bubblegum yeast flavor. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,5,"Awesome, summer beer perfect sweet and sour flavor from malt and orange and coriander super balanced and refreshing every time for a Belgian wit ale"
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.09,"Unique taste, very nice. Orange and cream."
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4,"Look: Clear yellow with 2 fingers of head
Smell: Notes of wheat and lemon
Taste: Crisp and clean. Wheat and citrus notes are detected.

Hoegaarden Original White Ale,4.09,"Enjoyed this around the firepit recently for the first time in at least a decade. My first real go-to Wit. Love it nostalgically, and still delivers great flavors, especially at such low abv"

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.4,"3 months old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy light yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving lots of lacing. Some floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh tropical fruits, especially pineapple, mixed with some citrusy notes of orange and tangerine.

Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.

Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,5,"A world class offering from a world class brewery. This takes pale ales to the next level. Pours a beautiful hazy, citrus color. Nose is floral and grassy with a hint of sweetness. Flavors match the nose perfectly. Slightly more subtle than it's regular counterpart but still very enjoyable"

O - very good, deserving of its rating"
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.48,"Can Date: 2/7/22
Palate Contaminants: none

Wet straw color, completely opaque. Lots of very fine white head, with lots of lacing.

All sorts of citrus on the nose. Red grapefruit, acidic orange, touches of lime. Moderately sweet malt. Marshmallows. It strikes a really nice balance.

The fruits are dialed back in the taste, and there's more of a vegetation/leafy flavor up front. Mild bitterness. Tart sweetness shows up a bit late, right there with the citrus. The flavors are notably sharp, too. (And this particular can was brewed five weeks ago.)

Aftertaste is bitter, but it's a dull bitterness. Very nicely integrated carbonation, and it's one of the finest I've run across. Medium weight."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.5,"Pours a very cloudy orange color with a thick off-white head and lots of soapy lacing.

The smell is amazing - strong citrus with a hint of pineapple.

The taste is bitter citrus, mostly grapefruit, with a slight pineapple finish.

The mouthfeel is medium body and soft with a lingering bitter finish.

Overall, this is amazing. The smell makes this beer. Very enjoyable."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,"A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy pale yellow in color. It poured with a finger and a half high white head that has excellent retention properties and hardly died down.
S: Moderate aromas of lime citrus are present in the nose along with notes of lychee.
T: The taste follows the smell, except that the flavors of lime and lychee are more balanced. Only a slight amount of bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and a bit juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer has the amount of aromas and flavors you would expect from an Imperial IPA but has the drinkability you would expect from an APA.

Intro: 12 oz. had on tap poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Cloudy, hazy orange, Moderate head maybe 1.5 inch. good lacing as I drank

Smell: Sweet, tangy citrus smell with like orange and pineapple. Appealing, inviting. Made my mouth water in anticipation.

Taste: Follows the smell. Very nice.

Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. .Didn’t really make my mouth pucker as it didn’t taste like a hop bomb.

Drink: Easy drinker. well balanced and went down smooth.

Conclusion: Really enjoyed this one. I’m not overly crazy about IPAs but this was well balanced and not over the top in bitterness. I could drink a few of these. Definitely try it if you have the chance."

F: Juicy & plush medium bodied mouth feel that is gently sticky & clean adding to it's med-long soft linger which goes wide. It is not overly drying.
O: An excellent beer with broad & refined structure, balance & flavor that is a fairly easy drinker. It is masterfully brewed and has an exquisite taste & feel. As an American Pale Ale it is world-class in it's style."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,3.71,"1st review. Sediment filled hazed pale ale. chunks like gold sink to the bottom of glass.
s) too faint, grassy, plains brew.
t) Ample ale of balanced bitter and malt more on the hop, grassy bitter side.
f) chunky, not quite refreshing
o) Original, but mid-pack. Gimme a Dales please."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.02,"Pours a clean but hazy orange yellow color with a medium bodied but sticky white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet medium light bodied malts and a hint of some citrusy/grapefruit and floral hops at the end. Tastes lighter than it looks, nice medium/light bodied malts and floral and some citrusy hops. It's lighter than it looks but still drying with a good amount of carbonation."
Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.02,"22oz bottle - review from notes

I really want this on-tap. Slight haze, white cap, smells like lemon zest and danks. Tastes follows the smell, and this drinks like a double IPA at only 6.8%, so much hop packed into a small package.

I *really* want this on-tap"
Framboos,4.37,"Bottling date 11/15/2019. Season 19/20. ABV is 6%.

L: Poured into a stemless wine glass. Color is like a deep rosé wine. Thin white head that fades to a soft blanket.

S: Raspberry dominates. A bit of barnyard funk and oak.

T: Follows the nose— main flavor is raspberry. Hint of lemon and barnyard funk.

F: Light, a bit acidic and dry

O: The nicest fruit lambic I’ve tried."
Framboos,4.31,"Caged and corked Bottle that was muled back to me from Belgium by my friend Chip

Ranked #6 as a fruited sour on beer advocate

Brewers Notes: Re-labeled as ""Framboos Oogst"" in the United States.

Multiple vintages; ABV varies slightly on every release.

Look is reddish liquid with a pink foam. AP that quickly settles to a ring

Aroma is tart raspberries

Taste is tart raspberries

Soft fizziness , tartness lingers

Good beer"
Framboos,4.75,"Pours a very nice light raspberry color with a slight head and lacing
Aroma has very generous raspberry hints
The taste follows the nose with a pleasantly tart raspberry flavor
A light bodied well carbonated beer
A great very well balanced Lambic"
Framboos,3.79,"Rose-copper body is quite nice, hazy, forming essentially no head even with an aggressive pour.
Mild, sharply tart, red fruit aromas of raspberry, cherry; light funk, light lemon juice.
At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

Give this a chance past the first few sips and you'll be rewarded. Bright and tart, with a refined and subtle effervescence and fruit character - the latter a disappointment for me, as I love raspberries."
Framboos,4.5,"Looks kind of strawberry light red. Smells like raspberries, and hops. Taste like Raspberries with some tart. Overall goes down nicely."
Framboos,4.51,"375 ml bottle, drank 10.10.21. Bottling date 18 Dec. 2019. Blend n14 Season 19/20.

Really enjoyed this, murky red raspberry color. Not the most attractive beer on the planet but the look underlies the fruit inside. I wouldn't call it overly acidic, more tart and chock full of fruit with lasting tarty raspberries. It's not as ""in your face"" as some raspberry wilds can be, but it's not as delicate as others are - this one is all about the thick fruit look, feel and taste. Cheers!"
Framboos,3.93,"Shared 750 ml corked & caged bottle at local tasting. Red colour, very little carbonation, no head. Intense aroma of ripe and over-ripe raspberries. Sour and intense flavour, ripe and over-ripe raspberries again, some tart and lemony notes too."
Framboos,4.3,I had the 14 (no carb) but still a wonderful beer to try. Still very delicate and fruity even if the stillness of the beer can be a bit distracting if you're looking for something more effervescent.
Framboos,4.41,"Season 18/19. Blend no. 29. Poured at 54 degrees. Deep gold with excellent clarity; thick, rocky white bubbles; initially poor cap retention, but as the bottle warmed, much better retention and moderately heavy lacing. Earthy raspberry aroma, with light barnyard funk; some aged cheese; fresh baled hay. Taste is raspberry, sour fruit, tart green apples and some funky hay. Light carbonation; light body, but not watery; dry, light acidic feel; minor pucker. Overall very pleasant to drink but no “wow” factors; fairly mild sour raspberry nose/taste; funk factor is low; minor ding to aroma score for cheesy notes; very good, but expensive...I’d drink again if at a lower price point."
Lagunitas Sucks,3.78,"No, Lagunitas REALLY sucks."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.46,"Some scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack of 12 ounce bottles.
This beer pours a deep gold color and is crisp and bright tasting. It is sweet and slightly resinous and is extremely easy drinking for it's 8% ABV. I hope they continue to make it as it is one of my favorites from this brewery. Excellent!"
Lagunitas Sucks,3.42,"355 ml bottle, at a breakfast joint in Petaluma. Deep golden to orange colour, large off-white head. Aroma and flavour of citrus, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me, but still a fairly nice beer. Some alcohol in the finish. Anyway, I wouldn’t say that it sucks."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.18,"The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor."
Lagunitas Sucks,3.39,"Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.46,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass an off white 1F head is formed. Beer is 95% transparent and mid gold in color with tons of fine particulate. Really interesting!

On the nose I get some mild onion, pine, salt, malt grapefruit pith and rind. The aroma is intoxicating!

On the palate, WOW, orange, malt, salt water effervescence that is thirst quenching and makes me want more. It is a bit candylike and sticky thick but I want more. The malty stickiness is balanced with relatively mild hops that are grapefruit and pine. The finish is astringent and cloying but I like it because it is mellowed by the malt.

Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, cloying and tasty. Some dryness to cut the malt on the end.

I was not expecting this. I was expecting a hugely dank and super bitter beer with astringent roof peeling dryness. Not even close. Sweet candylike malt and restrained interesting hops make this a beer I will have again. A big tasty malty balanced hop bomb."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.78,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up a single from Total Wine for $1.99. I've heard a lot about this bottle for the past decade I've been a beer geek but this is the first time I've seen it in the wild. No discernable date on the bottle but some cryptic numbers printed on the neck.

Appearance - Very hazy. Even with backlight can only barely make out the hazy silhouette of my hand. Small one finger white head. Irregular going from fine to pancake batter with variable bubble size. Good retention, decent lacing and stick. 4.25

Smell - Grassy, sweet, lactic. Even a little floral. Interesting. Fairly weak for an Imperial though. 4.25

Taste - Ho ho ho. Good kick in the mouth. Yet still soft and cushiony. Somehow has a strong, bold up front pretense but with no harshness or off tones or over-bitterness. Impressive in that regard. I appreciate it. Very unique. 5

Mouthfeel - No harshness. Yet bold. 5

Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. Very sessionable for any beer let alone one at this ABV. World class easily, master crafted. No off tones whatsoever. No hiding flaws under strength. 5"
Lagunitas Sucks,4.75,"12 oz bottle dated 260 (9/16/20) poured into a Teku on 12/24/20.

Pours a 2"" fluffy white head. Golden orange and semi-transparent. Intense sticky lacing.

Dank, spicy, herbal, and musky hop aromas. Sweet malty booze with a subtle peppery scent.

Strong dank herbal flavor. Increasingly bitter finish with a musky quality. Sweet, but not balanced. Much more bitter.

Sticky, oily, resinous mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. Smooth and easy-drinking apart from the drying and bitterness.

Complex and predominantly hoppy in the weedy, dank direction. The alcohol isn't hidden, but it doesn't overpower. A very well-made dank DIPA."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.29,"12oz bottle. No dating but the verbiage around the label talks about going to a brighter and wiser 2021.
Brilliantly clear, deep gold colored body. Not much of a head upon pouring but a partial white cap covers the surface. Each sip leaves behind a tiny spot sheen of lacing. Quite the enticement to rotate the glass while drinking in order to get full glass coverage.
Aroma at a chilled temperature is hidden but bready malts and resinous hops come through.
Taste is full. Slightly sweet but well balanced with citrus, pine, and resin. The suggestion of bitterness is swirled and tempered by the floral sweetness. Leaves a buzz in the mouth, and the aftertaste continues the back and forth, with a resin high note.
Medium mouth feel. The stickiness of the resin also expresses in the mouth. Excellent carbonation.
As mentioned on the label, this is an excellent palate cleanser brew. Very expressive but without excess. Enjoyable."
Lagunitas Sucks,3.91,"I'm not usually in the mood for an IPA, but when I am I usually look for one that is really well balanced. Some IPAs just bludgeon you with hops and bitterness. I like hops, I like bitterness, but I like them in measured amounts. Lagunitas Sucks nails it. This is GOOD BEER. Dark amber, almost caramel in color with a thick white head. Not much on the nose, a little floral, piney. Taste is spectacular. Hoppy, malty, botanicals and pine. Lightly sweet, and a nice light bitter finish. Medium high carbonation. Lighter body, but not wimpy by any means. I'll definitely grab this again the next time I'm in the mood for an IPA. I'm pretty blown away that this is 8% abv. It is so smooth and drinkable. This is truly a quality beer."
Lagunitas Sucks,4.3,"look: amber, clear

smell: grass

taste: tea? bread, pine, brown sugar, mango

feel: smooth and easy to chug, tiny bitter finish

overall: lagunitas sucks!"
Lagunitas Sucks,4.75,"Pours a nice golden color with a nice one inch head with great lacing
Smell of pine and citrus

Trappist Tripel,5,"From a 1 Pint, 9.4 oz bottle poured into a Westmalle chalice --

L: Pale yellow with 1 inch fluffy head that will not be shaken.
S: Hoppy-spicy - strong on the nose - definitely a Tripel.
T: Beautiful blend of spicy and hoppy with the candy sugar flavor you'd expect from a Belgian ale.
F: Medium dry mouthfeel with light bubbles
O: There is a reason why this is THE tripel that all other tripels aspire to be. Perfect balance of flavors. If I had one beer on a desert island, it would be this one."
Trappist Tripel,4.58,"Light amber with a 2.5"" thick, foamy, meringue-like white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing.

Aroma is floral, Belgiany, fruity, toffee, spices, light citrus, light banana.

Tastes is Belgian yeast, cloves, toffee, dried fruits, banana, orange zest.

Medium body, light carbonation. Dry, spicy finish.

A very fine Belgian Tripel."
Trappist Tripel,4.5,"gold, foamy.
raspberry, apricot, orange, lemon."
Trappist Tripel,4.69,"A very slow pour released two fat fingers of creamy eggshell white foam with very long retention and irregular blotches of lace. Pale golden straw color, very hazy, I can barely see my fingers through it. I did not decant; some sediment is present.

Bold Belgian smell, aka, bubble gum, banana and bready malt with some funk greets the nose. Hop smell is mild and floral. Alcohol is noticeable yet considering the 9.5% ABV it is well hidden

Big taste of bready and caramel malt, semi-sweet with mild bitterness from alcohol more than hops. The alcohol taste is pervasive yet not astringent. Banana and clove in a Hefeweizen like way arrives late on the palate. The finish is fast, and flavors do not change much at the end. A peppery alcohol bite lingers that is warming and pleasant with bitterness rising to above average.

Medium-light malty body, well carbonated throughout the drink. Again, I must say how well the alcohol is hidden and presented. Balanced and easy to drink, the buzz hits quickly. This one is dangerously drinkable."
Trappist Tripel,3.82,"L - Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. HUGE frothy three finger off-white head. Pale golden hazy color. Lots of lacing and some alcohol legs.

S - Sweet Belgium beer scents. Bubble gum and banana

T - Spiciness comes through on the taste along with the banana and bubble gum. Moderate yeast flavors.

F - Fuller mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. A lot going on with each drink.

O - Overall, this is a really good beer. I’ve tried enough Tripels now to know that it’s not my favorite style of beer, but I am really glad I tried this one and would definitely recommend it to others as a solid representation of the style."
Trappist Tripel,4.99,Fantastic!
Trappist Tripel,4.51,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass
Appearance – The brew pours a lightly hazed golden amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a biscuit and cracker malt mixed with aromas of white grape and yeast. Along with these smells comes spice of clove and coriander as well as some apricot and peach. With a touch of harvest fruit and a bit of candied sugar an overall very inviting aroma is produced.
Taste – The taste begins with a mix of cracker malt and candied sugar sweetness mixed with flavors of apricot, grape and peach. At the same time there is a nice spice of coriander and clove as well as a decent showing of yeast cake and grain. As the taste advances the grain, spice, and candied sugar tastes fad a tad, all while the fruit, especially the peach, and yeast grown stronger. At the same time some hay and a touch of pear arrive on screen, producing a very pleasant, crisp, and flavorful taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the tastes the feel is spot on, and makes for a very nice crisp sipper.
Overall – A fantastic tripel. Super flavorful and crisp with a very easy drinking and balanced flavor. Defiantly one of the best out there."
Trappist Tripel,4.57,"330 ml bottle, exp. 09/23, excellent beer. Foam never ends. Dense. Alcohol mixes well with other scents, sweet ones. A hidden citric note fits well on mouth. The excess of foam is beautiful but is a bit of a disturbance to the tasting of it."
Trappist Tripel,4.72,"The beer is a hazy, translucent, bubbly yellow color, kind of straw but looks more burnt orange when held up to a light. Some yeast sediment is in it. Ample carbonation leaves a huge soapy white head that lingers.

The aroma is slightly sour and mildewy, some orange and lemon juice, big white wine/white grape must come to think of it, hay, toasty biscuit, slight sweetness, and white pepper.

The taste follows the nose pretty closely. The main flavors upfront are of dry white wine complimented by a nice tart citrus, (orange and lemon peel) and subtle barnyard funk, with hay, toasted cracker, and a white pepper floating in the background. The wheat and effervescent carbonation give this a fluffy and extremely pleasant mouthfeel. It closes out on a perfect balance of the sweet-dry spectrum. A hint of sweetness to tantalize the taste buds but dry enough to beg the next sip. This brew is wonderfully made. Holy mackerel. I see why many people consider this to be the quintessential Belgian tripel."
Trappist Tripel,3.72,"Westmalle Tripel.... it's been a minute since I've had a tripel, and I quite enjoy them, first time with this one.
Poured into a stemless total wine glass. Hazy gold body, huge soapy white head off a gentle pour. Loose, large bubbles, bone white, slowly fall back to a 1/4"" thin head that persists through the life of the beer. Large chunks of sediment despite an attempt to decant.
Nose? Banana, bubble gum, peppercorns, candi sugars, candied lemon peel. A lot going on, complex, no diacetyl or dms, phenols out the wazoo. No hops to speak of. Yeast driven nose, everything else is buried. As it warms there is a slight white wine smell coming through.
Taste, Bananas, bubble gum, alcohol, rock candy. Slight lemon on the aftertaste if I look hard. No hops, no grain, dry. As the beer warms there is a vineous note.
Mouthfeel- thin bodied and dry. Phenols give a suggestion of sweetness as does the alcohol. Effervescent. Each sip bursts into small bubbles as it hits the palate.
Overall. It's a well made beer, the yeast phenols push it into hefe territory for me. I much prefer Karmaleit when it comes to the style. Not sure why I got so much banana from this bottle."
Trappist Tripel,4.51,"Pours a cloudy bright orange color. Mostly opaque with a moderate amount of suspended sediment. Thick two finger white head forms on the beer, settles in, then dissipates leaving just a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is lovely - it has notes of malts, white grape, apple, pear, some light banana, and some floral hop notes. Its subtle, refined, yet complex.

The taste follows the nose with notes of rich malts, belgian yeast that leans into the fruity side of things with notes of apple, pear, white grape and just a hint of banana. Along with the fruity notes come some spiced notes - clove, allspice and peppercorn. Moderately spicy, but not overly so. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish with a light floral character. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, and somewhat warming. Very carbonated with a bright, lively mouthfeel.

Overall this is an outstanding tripel and one I will absolutely revisit."
Trappist Tripel,4.27,"An absolutely gorgeous glass of beer that lasts to the last sip. Cloudy pale orange white sudsy head, but no lacing. This was flavorful and aromatic, banana, clove, caramel and a hint of pear. Smooth, creamy texture, long lasting carbonation. This is just a really great beer, I just didn't like."
Trappist Tripel,4.29,"Pours a cloudy, golden amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smells of caramel malt, floral hops, with hints of citrus, some fruity esters and hints of toffee. Taste is a great balance of caramel malt, fruity and slightly spicy esters, with notes of banana, apricot and clove, as well as lighter floral, bitter hops with hints of orange rind and toffee also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with some banana, orange rind and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This is actually the first time I've had this Tripel and while it is very good indeed, it doesn't quite reach Tripel Karmeliet or Chimay Tripel to me. The banana notes are quite at the forefront here, which I'm not a huge fan of, while the spice is noticeable, but a little subdued. Nevertheless there's a great balance of malts, hops and esters to this, with quite a rich and full body and mouthfeel as well. I was actually surprised by how much hops, relatively speaking, are left in this at just over one year old and would love to try it fresh sometime, which just might edge it a little closer to my aforementioned favorites. Also, considering that this has the highest ABV out of any Tripel I've tried so far, it really doesn't feel overly boozy at all."
Trappist Tripel,4,"Bought a single 11.2oz bottle $6.99 Fujioka's
367 days old or 363 days before best by date
Smell of bananas, spices
Hazy golden-orange color
Medium-heavy mouthfeel
Medium-high carbonation
Taste of alcohol hits me first, then bananas, oranges, cloves, spices
Overall a good beer for the style although the alcohol taste is more present than others of the same style."
Trappist Tripel,4.24,"330 ml bottle, best by 6/15/22, showing no signs of age; enjoyed in a Westmalle Trappist chalice.

Hazy golden color, one finger varying head which dissipates only slightly. Full cap and curtain lacing. No visible sediment or floaties.
Deep apple, banana, bread yeast, light citrus and pine aromas.
Apple, pear, ginger, raisin, light pepper and floral notes. Light honey sweetness that dissolves leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste.
Smooth coating mouthfeel with little to no alcohol heat. Great lasting carbonation. Dry enough to tempt one to drink rapidly until the 9 % ABV arrives.
A lot to unpack , as it should be at $6.50 for 330 ml in our stores. Merits the “World-Class” designation."
Trappist Tripel,5,One of the Original triples from Belgium I believe this beer got it all amazing golden color milky head perfectly high carbonation and bitter sweet finish it’s a classic and I love it! And you should too!!
Trappist Tripel,4.4,"Pours a hazy golden colour with a strong orange tint, a pillowy three inch head appears and slowly collapses into a thick, lacing creamy line of white.

On first smell, there is a deep, savoury aroma unlike anything I’ve smelled before. Will have to come back to this (many times!) to develop my palate a bit more. Suffice it to say, it’s very enticing. Delicious aromas of yeasty breads, wheat, and spices waft around. Banana’s and specifically green apples make up a strong fruity backbone — less citrus and juicy, more of that smoother textured fruits, the aforementioned creamy bananas, silty earthy apples. Again, that tasty savoury aroma appears almost heavy in my nose. Maybe I know what people mean when they say ‘doughy yeast’ now

Taste does follow the nose, and is remarkably complex in many ways. Spicy fruits up front here for me, apples cloves and nutmeg, a little sweet with maybe only the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Savoury in the middle with tasty grains and malty notes, candi sugar, and banana. There is a very long finish that rests on a gentle bitter-sweetness, remaining with a doughy taste on your tongue.

Medium bodied, this is well carbonated but not carbonated too strong as to overpower the flavours. Coalesces into a creamy sip on the way down, finishes dry and bittersweet leaning on the sweet side.

I love overpowering malty Tripels, which is not what you get with Westmalle. Instead, you get one that is a little gentler, but melds an enormous amount of wonderful aromas and flavours into a perfectly blended and smooth beer. No note stands out too much, each has its place and they wax and wane in and out together to create a remarkable experience. Absolutely wonderful beer"
Trappist Tripel,4.51,"This is what great Belgian beer should look, smell and taste like .... Fluffy white head, pretty color, beautiful bouquet and lovely feel ... Big thumbs up!"
Trappist Tripel,4.48,"A marvelous beer. Pours with a complete white head. It has a very malty scent. The flavor is very strong and this one sneaks up on you. Loved it. Not perfect, but I don’t know what would be better."
Gulden Draak,4.43,"delicious malty beer. great head, dense foam. sweet and silky on the tongue."
Gulden Draak,1.77,Tastes like carbonated soy sauce. Smells like soy sauce. Am i drinking spoiled Draak?
Gulden Draak,4.19,"Went all the way to Grace in Growlers in Oahu to try this Belgium Strong Dark Ale. Pours a beautiful ruby, red, brownish, black. Nice lacing and hits all the notes (fruit, slight sweetness) of a Strong Dark Ale. It's been several years that I have add a Belgium Strong Dark Ale and the yeast just popped (could be the humidity!)."
Gulden Draak,4.94,"Strong malt, caramel with a mouth filling taste. Smooth creamy mouthfeel. My absolute favourite. Always a treat to drink."
Gulden Draak,4.31,"Ruby colored with a nice khaki head, great retention and lacing
Dark malt aroma with some banana and light clove
Prune, brown bread, some banana and light clove flavor
Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated
Pretty good"
Gulden Draak,4,"11.2 oz bottle. Pours dark red with tall, long-lasting, foamy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is Belgian yeast, caramel malt, spices, brown sugar, herbal hops and dark fruit. Body is full and crisp. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is long and spicy. Great brew."
Gulden Draak,4.19,"To me, this brand has always been synonymous with excellence and authenticity. They seem to always have that Belgian yeast taste and beautiful balance. This is no exception, but as worth the others I've reviewed, it is exceptional.

It pours deep reddish brown with plenty of foam. Gorgeous. The aroma says Belgium. There taste is that malty darkness with yeasty astringent overtones. The experience is always a treat.

Highly recommended. When you need to break out of any kind of funk, this will do it."
Gulden Draak,4.19,"Huge foamy head with a hazy rusty brown body. Smell is lighter than expected; bubblegum, banana, plenty of esters, bread dough, and a hint of coriander. Taste is boozy, upfront caramel and figs, then banana and more caramel, and a slightly hoppy backbone, with hints of orange peel and spice throughout. Very smooth, as noted by many. Not disappointed."
Gulden Draak,4.07,"Look: Dark golden brown with light brown, thin head. Very nice.
Smell: Slightly boozy, very sweet and malty
Taste: Malty, and slightly fruity notes. Pleasant caramelly finish.
Feel: Thick and smooth, not very dry.
Found it in a dark corner of a local market in the imports section. Very pleasant beer overall. Satisfied with my pick."
Gulden Draak,4.69,"Poured into snifter. Ruby brown, a good khaki cream head that abates to a persistent but thin ring and a big blotch of lace.

Nose is dark fruits and malt.

Taste is the same, very malty sweet, some banana notes with the dark fruits. Delightful.

Feel is crazy smooth especially with that ABV.

Years ago, this was my first fancy Belgian ale. It's still great."
Gulden Draak,4.25,"Beautiful beer. Lovely clear red amber, with a big, tan, pillowy, three finger, Belgian head. The aroma is dominated by cherry, caramel, and red wine, with a hint of ethanol. The taste is a symphony of fkavour: berries, caramel, red wine, brown sugar, and noticeable but very well balanced alcohol. This is by far the smoothest and most agreeable 10.5% I've ever had. This is great stuff, and widely available, so get some and enjoy it. If someone wanted to know what Belgian beer is like, I would give him one of these as the archetypal Belgian."
Gulden Draak,3.79,"Served at 4°C. 1,5€ 0,33l from Lidl.
L: Huge marvellous head that slowly recedes (5 min) into a thin lacing. Brown-Dark amber opaque colour.
S: Malts and caramel.
T: Taste of smoked malt, caramel, nuts, spices, bittersweet (more on the bitter side) and complex.
F: Low carbonation. Medium bodied. Heavy ABV.
Very good warming winter beer."
Gulden Draak,4.73,"I wanted to try this beer since 2013.
For some reason I kept postponing it for years. Big mistake.
Probably the smoothest Triple Ale I've ever tasted."
Gulden Draak,4,"Smooth, light.
Subtle flavors, enjoyable."
Gulden Draak,4.4,"Look: dark amber with a medium off white head

Smell: malt, dark fruits, hops

Taste: nice balance of malt and dark fruit flavors

Feel: smooth and bubbly"
Gulden Draak,4.59,"It’s like sparkling grape juice, ale, and figs had a baby. Very good celebratory beer, will definitely revisit around Christmas."
Gulden Draak,4.68,"Deep reddish brown body with a thin tan head. Aroma of dark fruits, red wine, and strong caramel malt as well as some spice. Taste is slightly fruity with a lot of nice touches from the wine yeast. Finish is spicy caramel cookie. This is a perilously easy drinking strong ale. It drinks like a lighter belgian red ale, but packs a nice warming touch at the end. One of a kind world class ale."
Gulden Draak,4.03,"10/11/2021 The appearance of the bottle itself is exceptional. The first to pour out was a little bit of head. Crystal clear very dark amber, big foamy creamy persistent head. Very lacy. What a beautiful beer; Aroma is mild and good. (my sniffer is ineffectual); Flavor is pretty good; Mouthfeel is smooth and sparkly; My overall impression is very good, based primarily on appearance. If I hadn't been able to see this beer, I probably wouldn't have liked it so much. But even then it's better than average.

10/20/2021 The flavor is rich, smooth, robust. I bump the taste rating from 3.75 to 4. I like this beer."
Gulden Draak,4.28,"11.2oz bottle coded 18AU poured into a Gulden Draak tulip glass at fridge temp 10.5% ABV. The beer pours bright in a dark amber color with light brown head. The head builds quickly and settles slowly to a half inch cap. Spotty lacing. The aroma is brown sugar, sweet malt and Belgian yeast spice that's more clove than anything. The taste is semisweet clovey malt with notes of berry, cherry, brown sugar, caramel and dark dried fruits. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent."
Heady Topper,4.46,"Canned on: ???? (Picked up fresh from the brewery, though.)

A - Very hazy medium orange gold color with a dense ring of creamy white lacing.

S - Bright citrus, citrus rind, dank pine, and earthy peppery citrus rind. ,

T - Juicy floral, citrus, citrus rind, a slight bit of peppery spice with some resiny pine bitterness on the back end. Finiand shes on the balanced side with a lingering mix between earthy juicy citrus and resiny pine.

M - Big medium body with prickly carbonation and bone dry on the back of the tongue.

O - Not, sure why I've never reviewed this before because I've had alot of it in the past. Final verdict? Enjoying this beer equally as much today as I did when I first had it. This Classic never gets old (IMO), just total all around class. One of my all time favorites."
Heady Topper,4.75,Pours a hazy gold. Thick foam. Juicy sweet hop aroma. Loads of dank hop flavors. Some sweetness. Some bitterness. Loads of juicy goodness. Not for the beginner but definitely very drinkable and a must have if you love IPAs.
Heady Topper,4.74,"Canned 8/18/22. Purchased that day at the brewery.

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.

S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.

T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.

F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.

O: Heady Topper takes no prisoners. An absolute hop smackdown that also showcases a wide variety of aromas and flavors. This is the DIPA for those who think west coasts are too bitter and hazies are too juicy."
Heady Topper,4.74,"I opened a pint can, bright citrus (mostly pineapple), pine and herbal hops greeted the nose. Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.

Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA.

Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.

Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?""
Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.


Canned on 7-25-22"
Heady Topper,4.75,"My second favorite beer of all time. Absolutely nothing but awesome deliciousness throughout. Unfortunately I live in Wisconsin, and have to pay my brother to send me 4 packs. I love the somewhat malty hopped taste, when you open a can it’s aroma is almost as good as the taste. It’s been around for years, yet with all the new brews coming and going, it has rarely met it’s match."
Heady Topper,4.15,"I’m not understanding the hype around this one. My buddy from MA sent me a four pack for my birthday so I have been dissecting this for a week now.

Pours a wonderful, slightly hazy dark straw color with an immaculate head.

Aroma seems a bit lacking. Sure it has hops but it isn’t overwhelming or any better than the other 100 IPAs out there. Kind of citrusy with a touch of pine.

It’s a little malty for my liking. Thick and heavy. The hop oils really coat the tongue. Bitterness is average, not too much.

It’s a good beer but not world class IMO."
Heady Topper,4.91,"We were in Rhode Island when I first had this beer.
Hope I can find it in other places.
Very smooth IPA."
Heady Topper,4.84,"Look: Yeah, I know, I poured it out into a glass – old habits die hard. Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt
Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite
Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish
Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen often"
Heady Topper,4.24,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.25. No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.

Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.

Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.

Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.

Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.

Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect."
Heady Topper,4.62,The only truly hoppy beer I have ever liked. I do not like IPAs or hoppy beers in general and headytopper is unbelievably good
Heady Topper,4.66,What superlatives can I use that wouldn’t be redundant. A winner all around! If you’re lucky enough to find it; buy it!
Heady Topper,3.72,"Very difficult beer to find in my area. Luckily, there was what appears to be a one time drop at my local store - very limited amount. I scoffed two 4 packs. This is definitely a solid brew, but I don't find it all that drinkable. I was never able to drink more than one before wanting to move on to something else. Pretty one-dimensional to me - bitter, bitter, and bitter. I prefer a more balanced, multifaceted IPA.

If I come across some I will probably purchase a 4 pack, but it's not something I will be actively seeking out, there are plenty of other beers that I prefer over this one."
Heady Topper,4.4,"Alchemist Heady Topper Imperial IPA, 8% ABV. Can is dated 05/09/22. Pours...wait, didn't pour it, per the label. Nose is a forest of big f'ing pine trees. Taste follows, and though hugely bitter, still quite drinkable. Excellent mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Overall world-class. I've got sap in my beard and I'm belching pine trees."
Heady Topper,3.84,"Maybe it's because it has been hyped, maybe it's because I drank it in a glass rather than from the can (as suggested on the can), but I was underwhelmed by this most hyped of IPAs...

It does look pretty good, has a very piney smell that just doesn't resonate with me, and the taste is full of that same resin that comes from pine. I suppose there are many that swear by it, but this just isn't what I was expecting from a ""world class"" beer. Mouthfeel was smooth, I do have to give it that, actually very smooth. Out of respect and acknowledgement I did give it an overall higher rating than I normally would, but in the end I'm walking away feeling, well...meh..."
Heady Topper,4.58,The quintessential IPA - nice hop bite but tempered bitterness. Just an outstanding first step into piney goodness with a citrus backbone.
Heady Topper,4.88,"I've been fortunate enough to have this multiple times and each time I'm impressed. Looks the part of a fantasticly crafted IPA. Pale yellow color with a nice murkiness. Smell is off the charts when fresh and bursting with pine and citrus. Just like the nose there is lots of pine and orange zest, but never overly bitter. Dangerously drinkable even though its a bit hefty in the body. I've had multiple in a night before and though the morning after was a touch rough, I didn't regret a single sip. Overall, this beer is worth every bit of praise it receives in my opinion."
Heady Topper,4.94,"Finally found the Holy Grail in Colorado. Unexpectedly pine-forward. I am sick of all those juice NEIPAs out there. This is a NEIPA style with pine, The perfect IPA. I bought 20 of these, and they'll be gone by the end of Memorial Day."
Heady Topper,4.19,"Dave Dave Erazo vacationed in New England and brought my son and me some Alchemist brews. Fresh Heady Topper at refrigerator temperature poured from the can (!) into glasses. Slightly cloudy pale yellow body with a pure white cotton candy head. Aroma is powerfully hoppy, sort of reminiscent of the pungent Ballantine ale from Newark in 1971. Very good beer. It's hop flavor and aroma are accompanied by a lasting flavorful bitter aftertaste. For myself , I could use a bit more malt body, possibly with a little less alcohol. But this is a memorable modern IPA, probably the best one I've tasted."
Heady Topper,4.91,Best NEIPA I have had. Super drinkable and all around delicious. A light sweetness to the malts balances with a hearty hop bitterness and makes it more refreshing and easier to drink than I expected. Great beer.
Heady Topper,5,a little over a month old. tried some from the can but i preferred drinking from a glass to get a good whiff of the hops while taking a drink. It is slightly foggy with a good head and lacing. Nice citrus smell. citrus follows to the taste with pine balancing it out. i had my doubts but it lived up to the hype.
Cappuccino Stout,3.53,"Dark ruby-black color, roasted caramel and coffee aroma, coffee, plum-caramel flavor, creamy smooth and full mouthfeel. Nice tan clingy head, leaves a nice lacing in my glass, nice stout."
Cappuccino Stout,3.86,"Black in color with minimal light penetration. There’s a half inch of creamy brown on top. The aroma is of cappuccino and dark chocolate. I’m tasting cappuccino and dark chocolate. The mouth is oily, viscous, and dry."
Cappuccino Stout,3.84,"Pours a solid black body with a fluffy white head. Smell is coffee, a little chocolate and malt. Taste is coffee, milk chocolate, malt, touch of hop bitterness, and a little sugar. Medium body, pretty close to a cup of cappuccino actually. Overall, for the price this is pretty darned good. Not my favorite, but price wise you could consume this more regularly so, a winner."
Cappuccino Stout,4.24,"One of the beers I make it a point to pick up every year. Looks like I've rated this anywhere between 3.5-4.75, but averaging 4.25. A great value at around five bucks a bomber."
Cappuccino Stout,1.79,[Original rating 2017-01-27] Smells like a rusty coffee can. Tastes like some day old maxwell house out of that can.
Cappuccino Stout,3.85,"Definitely not my favorite from Lagunitas. Pours brown; mocha head. Aroma is raisins; I can pick up Cappuccino notes after somewhat intense sniffing. Taste is dark chocolate and rasiniy, but no real cappuccino. Feel is medium carbonation with some warming quality. Overall, it's decent. Wouldn't get it again though."
Cappuccino Stout,3.74,"Pours black with a quarter inch light brown head that was fairly well retained and left very little lacing. Smells and tastes of cold brew coffee, milk chocolate, sweet malts and lactose. Light to medium bodied for the style, lightly carbonated, mouth feel is on the thin side for a stout, moderate bitterness."
Cappuccino Stout,3.67,"7/7/18: $4.49 3/4/18 Binny's purchase. 1 pint 6 oz 9.3% ABV bottle, multiple pours into 12 oz snifter. Pitch black pour, off tan puffy head, light tan lacing. Malt, slight roast coffee aroma. Strong cappuccino taste, slight malt. Balanced, not sweet or harsh. Medium body, slightly creamy texture, carbonation holds well. ABV sneaks up on you. Overall very good offering."
Sip Of Sunshine,5,"Lupulin Lupulin Lupulin. Perfect IPA. I am sick of the never-ending NEIPA trend. This is what I want and need. Pine, resin, lemon, and grapefruit. I cannot believe I can get this in CO on a regular basis."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.49,"From a 16oz can:

Appearance: Hazy gold with particles, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit.

Taste: Nice sweetened grapefruit, classic IPA/DIPA flavor. Good bitterness through the finish.

Overall: Was finally able to pick up this long-time want on my recent trip to Colorado. Excellent old-school IPA/edge of DIPA beer, nice grapefruit sweetness and bitterness, hits the spot!"
Sip Of Sunshine,4.1,"Bright light orange in the glass, smell of citrus and slight hop resin. Taste same as smell. Overall a really good ipa, not sure it really lives up to the 100 score given here, but nonetheless very good."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.17,"16 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Canned June 30, 2022, so really fresh. I'm excited to try this one.

L---Cloudy, but not impenetrable. Orangey amber color. Medium sized fizzy white head faded slowly and left good lacing.

S---Sweet & fruity. Orange, pineapple, mango. Floral notes.

T---Follows the nose, but not as strong. Floral & fruity flavors abound.

F---Dry & crisp. Kind of red wine like.

O---An excellent one. If I knew how good it is, I would've bought more than one."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.57,"This is a marvelous DIPA!!!! As good as any I have tried. Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass this beer featured a medium sized bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly and plenty of lacing on the glass. Beautiful, almost clear, orange/light copper color. Aroma and taste are wonderful. Like Heady Topper, the aroma bursts out the second you open the can - mostly floral hops and some tropical fruit. The taste features floral hops as well but there is more piney hops than the nose would indicate. There is some balance with rye or sourdough bready malt but hops rule here. There is a strong and welcome bitterness to this beer - more complex than a simple hop bomb - but bitter enough to satisfy any hophead. Mouthfeel is bitter, crisp and features a richness associated with the malt. Easily one of the best beers I have ever experienced."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.8,"I will just say this was fantastic, and lived up to the hype—and then some. This certainly Lives up to its name. Delicious. Just an utterly delightful beer to enjoy. Send me more."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.34,"very floral, definitely need to try a fresher can. Edit: drank 2 weeks fresh and the floral and piney hops shine with a beautiful and sticky-sweet harmony (compared to a 5 month-old can), only to be reined in by caramel and bready malts. Lingering aftertaste. 93/100."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.58,Sip of sunshine is a very consistent and very good double IPA. It drinks almost like a session IPA so smooth and mellow. You can have all your fancy smancy IPAs but this is consistently a great IPA
Sip Of Sunshine,4.93,"My last Sip of Sunshine I brought back from Smuggler's Notch. Such a tremendous IPA! Has a wonderful aroma of hops and tropical fruit. Taste is tropical, fruity, & lupulin hoppiness. This is a top level brew that should be sold & enjoyed in Florida. LOL! I wish."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.31,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous transparent orange with plenty of white head. Tons of lacing after the head recedes. Tiny bubbles throughout the glass that persist. Looks fantastic!

The nose is incredible. Oranges, apple pie, mango, pineapple, grass, a touch of honey, and a really nice hoppy layer at the end. This is definitely a wonderful tropical fruit nose. Juicy.

The taste nicely follows the nose. Tropical fruit is definitely there on impact, but nothing like the nose. The middle region and aftertaste are clearly bitter hops. Dank. Citrus peel. Leather, sourdough bread, and a strong earthy note.

Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Love it."
Sip Of Sunshine,4.5,"Rich, golden amber body; nice carbonation; thick head, dense, white, semi-creamy. Enticing aroma; soft earthy, fruity sweetness; orange and mango; light malt presence in the background. Outstanding citrus-forward flavors with a strong overarching hop bitterness; juicy orange and grapefruit; mild biscuit and cereal grain backbone; slight alcohol presence; balanced. Medium-heavy body; crisp and prickly; alcohol dryness.

A very nice, lively India pale ale.

Pouring temperature: 44 °F; canning data: 22FEB22"
Sip Of Sunshine,4.25,"Looks golden with an orange tint. Smells of tropical and citrus. Taste some hops with citrus and fruit notes, I cant point out specifically. Overall I love this beer, it goes down smooth"
Don De Dieu,4.75,"Oh how I love this kind of beer ! The spices, the fruitiness, the creaminess all work so good together. High alcohol but it doesn't really come through. I like pretty much all Unibroue, taste from home !"
Don De Dieu,3.77,"Don De Dieu from Unibroue. Purchased in a mixed six-pack from Franklin Beer Company, Franklin, PA, 27/08/22 for $ 15.00 (Including tax)/six-pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.208/oz) with twist-off caps. On room-temperature shelf at store and stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 31/08/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped “BF 01-14-24” in yellow ink on the rear shoulder. Served at 46.5 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 60.4 degrees.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Pale Gold (SRM 4), cloudy. Bottle refermented.
Body – Gold (SRM 5), opaque. Under direct light, same – just looks dirty. When rear-lite, pale gold (SRM 4) and translucent.
Head – Average (Maximum 2.3 cm, aggressive center pour), white, high density and fizzy but settling into a creamy 1.0 to 1.5 cm layer heavily fed by effervescence.
Lacing – Good. A creamy three-dimensional ring of microscopic to tiny bubbles grace the area just above the head, forming an old, weathered mountain range reminiscent of the Appalachians.
Aroma – 3.5 – Weak fruitiness. Spices not found. No malt, no hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4 – Begins slightly sweet with caramel maltiness, some blended spices, definite clove and weak cinnamon, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol 9 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate lower gastric warming slowly evolves. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium, watery edging into the area of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.75 My only previous encounter with this brew was in 2005, well before joining BA, and so had no review. I’m not a big fan of Tripels in general but this one isn’t bad. Despite the dirty appearance (bottle conditioned wheat beer) and the weak, muddled aroma, the flavor is not bad, and the creamy head is beautiful."
Don De Dieu,3.63,"Golden straw, cloudy, large head dissipates quickly but remains for a long time, minor lacing. Smells like a new world chardonnay with some pleasant sweetness. Alcohol present in taste, flavors of bread and grape with minor sweetness and hint of spice. Feel is quite nice and light. Less easy going than -but very similar to- the Blanche de Chambly."
Don De Dieu,3.98,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear, medium orange color with a massive white head. SRM of 9. (4.25)

Aroma: Mild to moderate aromas of sweet pale malts and cereal, bread, Belgian spices including sour citrus and juicyfruit, some coriander.

Flavor: Strong flavors upfront of orange citrus, juicyfruit, sweet orange and lemon notes. Behind that there's Belgian spices of citrus, flower, coriander, and juicyfruit. Then a sweet grain, banana, and bread malt and yeast flavor that mixes with a strong Belgian spiciness. A moderate, balanced finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A full-body and full mouthfeel. Slightly sweet as expected.

Overall: A well-done Belgian Tripel thatslightly leans toward a Wheat ale. Nice sweet grains and banana mix with the Belgian spiciness. Clean and dry enough, but also a decently sweet grain malt for a Tripel. Yeasty, full-bodied, and dynamic as expected. Slightly more grainy with wheat and spice than others. Preferrable though, rather than overly sweet. Drinks very nicely. (Rating: 3.98+)"
Don De Dieu,4.25,"12 oz bottle, vintage 2021, poured into a weizen glass at 48 degrees F:
L - golden and murky with a foamy white head
S - coriander, banana, clove, grass
T - heavy on the coriander and banana, definitely a wheat beer
F - lots of carbonation, light and crisp
O - good representation of the style"
Don De Dieu,4,"""Best by 4/22/24""; drank 5/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

Murky dull orange/yellow appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice off-white head; frothy tree-rung lace.

Lemon, orange peel, coriander & clove notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Lemon, clove, orange peel & coriander flavor.

Fruity & clove forward; a good beer."
Don De Dieu,4.35,"Aspirated some yeast back in, pouring an opaque deep ambered gold. Two fingers of dense head, slowly receding into a spotty cap.

Lovely aromas, peppery spices, allspice, white pepper, hits of cloves and cinnamon. Nice notes of yeasty esters, slightly doughy malts, caramel and toffee. Plenty of nice fruits as well, fresh oranges, bananas, pears.

Taste follows the nose in every sensation, what a great teaser and follow up. The doughy, caramel malts are dense, bready, and delicious. Balanced by some delicious fruits, palpable bananas and crisp, clovey spices and citrus. Delicious wheat, delicious spices, what a wonderful Tripel.

Medium-ish body, moderate carbonation, tiny bubbles that really let the flavours lie on the tongue. Long pleasant finish that is malty, caramel like and sweet, with the spices and wheat dancing on your tongue.

I’ll be honest — I like this more than La Fin du Monde. And a lot of their other beers. Maybe it’s because it’s more trappist inspired and that’s my jam, but this is really, really good. I’ll revisit their other beers periodically (as anyone in Canada will, Unibroue is just our go to for top tier beer) but Don de Dieu is phenomenal!"
Don De Dieu,4.43,"4-pack of bottles from John’s. Poured into Trappist tulip. Solid head, opaque dark gold color. Banana notes on nose and great tripel flavor. #theworldneedsmoretripels"
Don De Dieu,3.64,"BB: 10-14-24

A loud sound when TWISTING OFF the cap! Foam begins oozing out of the top of the bottle. Not a gusher, just a slow ooze.

Quite pale yellow-gold, hazy, and nicely carbonated. Foamy and fizzy head that, despite the active carbonation, never reaches more than ¾ inch or so due to it being so fizzy and receding fairly quickly. It leaves no lacing as it recedes, but some as I take a drink. But this meager lacing slides quickly down. (The empty glass has no lacing at all.)

The aroma is not strong. Initially, bready. If I tease it for a few minutes, some indistinct banana-esque fruit and spice.

The flavor is better than the weak aroma promised. Banana, clove-like spice, hints of apple, a bit of a tanginess. No bittering at all. Some hints of floral. The middle is smooth, with the tanginess keeping it from becoming too sweet. The finish and aftertaste, though, bring the sweetness up a bit for a generally sweet finish. The aftertaste remains sweet, tempered a little by the tanginess.

The mouth feel is moderate-to-thin and smooth.

Overall, this beer is merely OK to my taste. Nothing really stands out at the ""outstanding"" level, barely hitting ""very good"" in some aspects, so the overall is enjoyable but fairly mediocre. I am disappointed.

PS: As I reach the final 3rd of the glass, I'm upping my taste and feel a notch. As the beer warms to room temp (NB: I did start out at cellar temp, not 'fridge temp, so... ), it does develop a bit more complexity and a more inviting feel. The Overall aspect remains at mediocre.

If this is a top ten tripel in the world (as ranked on this site), it must be riding on the reputation of the brewer. Just sayin'."
Don De Dieu,4.46,"Poured at fridge temp from a 750ml bottle. Pours a murky yellow with a lot of white head. Nose is banana, apple, orange, wheat, yeast, honey, a bit of toffee. Really nice. The taste is fantastic. Nicely follows the nose with orange, vanilla, bread, and a nice hoppy bite at the end. This is quite minimal, but something that wasn't on the nose. Wheat, grass, lemon, honey. So smooth and crisp. Alcohol is really not detectable. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Overall, this is definitely a favorite. I don't see it often, so I will have to go hunting."
Don De Dieu,4.25,"Brownish-yellow, fluffy white head, not the greatest retention, not much in the way of lace
Pear, clove, pepper, cinnamon, slight banana
Banana, clove, pepper, whole wheat bread, a bit of light caramel, white rum
Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated
Really tasty, I've always like this one more than most tripels"
Don De Dieu,4.43,"Purchased as part of Unibroue's Winter Mix box., Served at room temp into a large stem Averbode tulip.,
Thick pouring,. dark gold colour., Pops up with a 1/2 inch head that dissipates slowly.,
Smells likes a nuttier belgian,. with a slight coriander spice.
Taste is rich and clean,. complex and just nudged up in flavour from a summer wheat beer.,
Mouth feel is a bit thinner than I expected,.
ABV is cloying and present ,. but no real aftertaste.,
Enjoyed this and will have no problem returning for more., Price was at 2.,00 bottle from BCLDB"
Don De Dieu,4.34,"Pours a hazy amber with a small head that ends as light lacing.

Smells of bready yeast and spice.

Tastes of bread and sweet malt with a wheat tang, banana and spice.

Medium light body with light carbonation. Lush clean mouthfeel..

This is an excellent sipper!"
Don De Dieu,4.34,"Appearance: Cloudy body. Average size, fast fading off white head . Light lacing.
Aroma: Yeast giving way to orchard fruit and spice.
Taste: Wheaty, still spicy, with layers of soft fruit. Hops are supportive but not overwhelming.
Mouthfeel: Lush and warming.
Overall: Complex and multi dimensional. A shining example of the style."
Don De Dieu,4.43,"Pours a hazy darkish orange/bronze color with a dirty white head which is fleeting dissipating to a bubbly lacing. Fruity, floral, yeast, malt and spice (clove) on the nose. Taste is wonderful! Complex flavor of apple, malt and honey to begin with before some spice (clove and nutmeg) and lastly hops with a dry finish. This ones a drinking experience!"
Don De Dieu,4.19,"L: deep hazy orange color. Large foamy head, recedes to just touching the rim of edge of the glass with a thin layer in the middle. Not much lacing. Large bubbles.

S: Belgian yeast, citrus notes. Airy hops and a little spice. The faintest hint of alcohol.

T: spice and cloves. Pepper somewhat. Hops and citrus fruit. Apple or orange. Not getting too much banana with this one. It’s rounded but a little more bitter than a banana-heavy triple. Alcohol is hidden well.

M: High end of a medium bodied beer. Medium-full. Tart carbonation.

O: A more citrusy and hoppy triple than some others. Definitely enjoyable and another solid offering from Unibroue."
Don De Dieu,4.18,"No matter how easy I pour a thick white foam head appears. Not a lot of lacing either, I kind of expected it to stick to the glass but it runs down inside for the most part. The color is wonderful, golden / orange hue with a touch of cloudiness that makes me think of summer evenings. The flavor is pretty complex and for 9%, everything about it hides the alcohol. The hops are smooth, with a small hint of bitterness on the back end. The lingering of sour notes prevail and it drags on the great flavor profile. It smells lightly of spice and falls perfectly into this category. As with many of Unibroue's offerings this one is a wonderful balanced Tripel. I don't think it beats my favorite of theirs (Maudite) but it's still an amazing beer."
Don De Dieu,4.17,"sunrise orange with a tight and lingering white head. Nose is of Belgian yeast and wheat spice. Taste follows the nose with a nice hit of Belgian yeast up front, followed by a softer wheat spice, hints of honey crisp, and maybe some earthy hop towards the end. Finishes very dry. Body is light to medium with hight carbonation. Overall a nice tripel, that is very solid and an excellent example of the style, personally I prefer La Fin Du Monde more."
Don De Dieu,4.36,Really unique beer. Combines the banana and clove of a classic wheat with the bread and candied fruit of a Belgian. Unibroue has to be one of the best breweries not just in North America but maybe the world. Everything they make is just outstanding and incredibly well crafted
Don De Dieu,4.35,"From the short foil wrapped bottle in a snifter. This very nice
brew pours a murky amber tinged wet straw color with a nice
head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping
layer, and sports some lightly lacing. Nose of subtle banana,
clove, soft wheat, subtle cracker, and faint orchard fruits. Flavors
surpass the nose with light peach, soft wheat, moderate banana
from the phenol notes, light coriander, cracker, light breaded malt
touches, and a mild herbal note on the rear. Nice mouth feel;
medium body, medium light soft carbonation, and a subtly
dry finish.

Of note, some light lemon and orange zest comes through with warmth.

Overall----pure excellence from an excellent brewery!

Cheers"
Coors Light,2.76,"Obviously, it's Coors light. There is a mix of light bread and banana scents with a much cleaner finish than the competitor light beers. I usually keep this around for the end of the night when I don't want much more alcohol/calories but want another round. It also has a place in a large cooler for a summer event. Not a bad product for what it is."
Coors Light,1.79,"Bought at a supermarket in Algorta (Spain). 330 ml. bottle poured into a Pilsener glass.

-No foam head. Lots of bubbles.
-Herbal smell.
-Pilsener taste but very bodied.
-Almost no after taste.

Very dull beer."
Coors Light,2.23,"Had an original Coors beer recently and it brought back memories from the 60s for me. Got one of these to see if it did the same. It did. Not close to what I really remember though. Anyway, if you're looking for something light, this one will work."
Coors Light,1.9,"Poured from a 12oz can best by September 12th 2022 into a pils glass

On the pour I was pleasantly surprised by a nearly 4 finger head from a slightly hard pour. The dissipation is still fast enough that it goes down to a covering over top in a minute, but still I expected worse. Very very lively carbonation with a very pale straw body, barely darker than a champagne.

Aroma is bad. Watered down, and what is there is all awful terribly treated yeast. Has an old sweaty character to it with a certain metallic quality as well. No malts are detectable on the nose over all the offness. Straight failure barely has a beer smell it's just bad. Not disgusting like shit, but it's bad. I can see why it's called piss water.

Taste is thankfully not like the smell some malts are actually present, just a vague crackery malt with zero bitterness to balance. The malts come at the very end however and the rest of the beer gives a beer flavored seltzer vibe. Very watery even in flavor.

Feel is of carbonated water with much more carbonation bite than necessary. Slightly more body than actual soda water with some head forming on your sip but it's hard to get past the carbonation bite. Super easy to put down from the can though, for the same reason white claws are easy to put down, your body assumes it's just bubbles and water.

Overall you'd probably be better off drinking keystone light or even bud light. I prefer Banquet over Budweiser, but coors light is some authentic piss water."
Coors Light,2.78,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge, spongy head atop.

Aromas are defined by fresh cut hay, a spicy hop note and a rustic toffee sweetness.

This has quite a refreshing mouthfeel to it with a late, stony effervescence, highlighting the light body of the beer.

Tastes of hay, well water and a bubbly, mineralic carbonation, inviting a well working malt backbone to the palate. Has a subtle, yet sugary mid palate with nothing else to offer and finishes with a sprizzy, yet watery ending.

This manages to be light and refreshing, while unfolding a one dimensional flavor profile at the same time, making this perfect for when its effect is more important than the beer‘s actual taste."
Coors Light,1,Is water with some beer flavors. Sometimes now with sludge.
Coors Light,1,"No, just no."
Coors Light,2.72,"There are some instances when Coors Light tastes like the greatest thing in the world. When you need a light beer and you peer over at the tap handles and spot Bud. Then Miller. And then you scan a little further and see those mountains peering over the other handles it brings a feeling of relief over me. Of the big three light beers in the US, this is without any dispute, the best. Semi sweet, crisp, American piss water. How it should. I’m a sucker for a good Molson Canadian, this basically that in light form. We get it, light beer, piss, feh. There’s a time and a place for Coors light. It’s refreshing, it goes down like nothing and it doesn’t tastes like stale cat urine. That’s a win in my book. Love Train."
Coors Light,2.45,"Weak on flavor, even for a light beer."
Coors Light,2.04,Taste like dirt water and I love it.
Coors Light,2.93,"I bought a silver bullet 473ml at 4%.
In Canada.
Poured beer into glass with 1 finger head but leaves a little bit of a lace as you drink it.
Very clear clean golden color good carbonation.
Overall an ok light Beer
Cheers"
Coors Light,1.38,"One of the first beers I've ever tasted many years ago. I described it as alcoholic water that's been soaked in bread.

Years later, I'd imagine not much has changed."
Coors Light,1.84,"So, I'm frequently prompted to drink this in a nearby neighbors' garage upon passing. I am frequently reminded that this is the very worst of all the macros, at least the popular ones. Surely there is worse beer possible, so I left room for those with my rating."
Coors Light,3.5,"It’s not a classy, sophisticated, craft beer. I know it. The color doesn’t give you warm fuzzies about it having taste. It smells like any macro in its class, nothing special. All that being said, I enjoy an ice-cold Coor’s Light. It’s light on the palate, refreshing, and not overbearing. You don’t drink it to impress or prove your knowledge of beer. You drink it because you’re a beer guy and it goes well with burgers or wings. It’s also nice to have while watching football or a movie.

It’s not going to overwhelm you with anything but you know what you’re getting. It’s wholesome, it’s decent, it’s affordable."
Coors Light,3,"I grabbed a can of Coors Light from somebody's refrigerator in California. I drank the can of Coors Light and wrote a review...

Look: Coors Light had abundant amounts of foam.
Smell: Coors Light had a chemical grainy adjunct beer aroma.
Taste: Coors Light had a vague flavour similar to carbonated water with hints of alcohol.
Feel: Coors Light had good amounts of fizzy bubbles.
Overall: Coors Light is a beer for people who will drink anything to quench their thirst."
Shiner Bock,2.91,"Truth in advertising here, almost to a fault. Copperish color, a tad off whit foam head that disappeared within a minute or so. N lacing. Aroma was soapy (hence the clean, crisp taste?). Taste was muted of any dominate ingredients. Easy drinking, then n feel. Would drink another if offered, doubt I will purchase again."
Shiner Bock,4.98,"A great Texas-take on a German-style beer, which is more lager, than a traditional German Bock beer. Lacing was decent. Smell was very much bread-like and malty and not at all hoppy. Goes down smooth and easy. If you're looking for a more medium body beer that is great to enjoy on a hot day.... this is your beer. And yes.... every drop is still very much brewed in Shiner, Texas. Their brewery tour in Shiner is pretty cool."
Shiner Bock,3.79,"Undated bottle. Nice clear dark ruby with a brief off-white head. Tastes a lot like a lager, but with roasted malts and a bit of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. No bitterness in the taste or in the finish. Overall, an easy-drinking ""lite"" American take on the style."
Shiner Bock,3.68,"Poured from an undated 12 oz. bottle: beautiful, clear garnet red with a quickly receding, foamy white head.

The aroma is somewhat subdued with ""lager-like"" aromas of spicy malts and faint hops.

Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is quite light and subtle to be an authentic ""bock"" beer that tends to be full-bodied and somewhat thick; however, this is a good ole American style version that is a thirst-quencher for hot summer days in Texas as well as the rest of the USA. The initial flavor is slightly tangy with malts and hints of molasses. The hop complement and zesty carbonation keep this one refreshing and quaffable. I almost detect a little rye in the aftertaste. At 4.5 % ABV, this one has a lot of flavor. The body is thin and the carbonation is quite high with a slick mouthfeel. I should drink this more often. Good buy from Wal-Mart."
Shiner Bock,3.45,"Pretty light flavor, chill beer, pretty intense carbonation"
Shiner Bock,4.18,It’s a great alternative to a traditional bock. Especially if you don’t have access to a stocked liquor store.
Shiner Bock,3.94,"Better than most of the macro brews, but firmly in the macro brew camp. Definitely hits the spot after a day fishing (one of my go to beers for that)."
Shiner Bock,3.5,Good ole Texas Beer. Better than the macros for sure
Shiner Bock,3.2,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, undated

On the pour a relatively weak 1 finger head forms then dissipates to a ring around the glass. Despite that lively carbonation ensues. The color is darker than amber, solidly brown and crystal clear. Some lacing tries to form a few sips in, but fails.

Aroma is quite light with a decent amount of generic, yet clean lager smell. No hops are really present, which is expected, and some sweet dark malts hide in the back with a vague caramel vanilla note and offset the relatively bright and almost tart lager note. However the aroma is very mild almost bland. Nothing off though.

Flavor follows the smell, but brings more malts with less sweetness. Lager character dominates this beer with malt being more of a background experience, however it is present. Relatively light, and the flavor isn't all that dark or complex.

Feel is easy to put down, but not really a bock. Very light and more like an American lager. In that category however this would do very well. It's light but still maintains body and doesn't just disappear. Nice and bubbly with a decent bite. Still bigger than coors or bud, but nowhere near a real bock.

Overall this is a good beginner beer, to bring someone over from only drinking light colored non hoppy lagers to the darker side of things. Also good for someone who likes lagers and dark beers (mostly lagers) and just doesn't want to think too much. Not complex and closer to an American lager than a bock despite the color. More yeast driven than malt driven, but clean and nothing bad about it other than lack of complexity and inspiration."
Shiner Bock,3.11,"Keeping in mind that this is an American Bock, and not a European style, expect this beer to be less aggressive on all counts.
A medium brown color, light tan head that doesn't last very long. Bubbly, like a soda.
Nose is light malt, no hops at all, which is actually good for the style.
Taste is a light roasted malt flavor with some raisin-like aftertaste. Just the slightest hint of hop bitterness but no hop taste at all. Very, very light body. Too much carbonation for my liking.
Judging this for what it is, it's an okay American bock."
Shiner Bock,3.58,"L - Poured from a draft into pint glass. One finger light off white head. Deep amber color. Clear with no inclusions. Some lacing that fades quickly.

S - Sweet bready malt up front. Some caramel notes

T - Some bitterness up front, but the maltiness takes center stage. Fades quickly. The malt flavors seem like a little caramel and a faint scent of roastiness.

F - Medium to thin mouthfeel. Light carbonation from the draft pour

O - As a Texan, I’ve had this many times, but this is my first time since trying more beers for review. The taste is good, but being a bock, the expectation is for “more.” More flavor, stronger flavors, etc. It’s fairly mild overall, but that means it’s easy to drink. Like a lot of the regionally famous beers, it’s highly easy to drink a lot of them. It definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend checking it out just to see what another regional standard tastes like."
Shiner Bock,4,"Undated bottle; drank 2/9/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through orange/brown appearance.

An even pour yielded a big eggshell head; decent lace.

Acorn, mild caramel & faint cream notes in the nose.

Creamy, medium mouthfeel.

Acorn & faint raspberry flavors up front; cream & faint hop bite notes in the nose.

A tasty beer. I'd have another."
Shiner Bock,2,"flat watery boring amber light lager. not a bock. Not that good. For people who like boring, forgettable swill. Basically a darker colored Yuengling, but more boring."
Shiner Bock,3.07,"12 fl. oz. bottle, in the Houston tent at the ONS 2008, Stavanger. Brown colour, moderate creamy head. Moderate but pleasant aroma of malts, hints of caramel. Fizzy mouthfeel. The flavour is moderately malty and bready without any offensive sidenotes, but not exciting either."
Shiner Bock,4.46,"All the damn beer snobs on here make me laugh. People complaining there isn't enough alcohol content to it, but you can see what it is BEFORE you buy it. Utterly ridiculous. People sound like they are reviewing a freakin cabernet or something. IT'S BEER FFS. Get over yourselves. This is a great beer. Very enjoyable. If you don't like it, great. Move on and buy something else. Idiots on here. I'm tired of them."
Shiner Bock,3.13,"Pours a crystal clear mahogany, half-inch off-white head that quickly fades, minimal lacing. Nose is light straw, lemon cleaner, and light roast as it warms - nothing objectionable, but nothing too prominent, either. Taste is a bit more expressive with light toffee sweetness, bread crust, and dark fruit. Mouthfeel has some chew but still drinks on the lighter side. Nothing off or offensive - just solid and sessionable."
Shiner Bock,3.34,"Feel is the main drawback here. Poured from the can into a Tulip, I got a slight metal taste like once so I don't think thats really a thing. Malty ish but not much doing. I got the sixer for less than $7.50 so that's sick but yeah.....some how also seems to get more light in feel as I get through it. This tastes like ""beer"" more than a bock if that makes any sense.


The feel seems to be better hella cold right out the can to me now lol idk dude"
Shiner Bock,3.2,If you like tangerines this is for you. It’s basically flavored vodka in beer form so if that suites you go for it no shame in that I just like spiced Christmas beer. Just know going in if it’s your first time that this isn’t a traditional Christmas beer unless you grew up on it. This definitely feels like a classic just not for me
Saison-Brett,3.77,"750 ml bottle, vintage 2013, probably from Vinmonopolet. ABV is 8.5%. Pale golden colour, only slightly hazy. Huge and lasting white head. Lovely aroma of saison yeast and brett, with fruity and peppery notes, hints of farmhouse. Medium sweet but still quite crisp flavour with peppery notes, distinct bittering hops."
Saison-Brett,4.01,"An acidic, but fruitful saison. Has a very relaxed aftertaste that is warm and fresh. The energy aroma is better than it’s taste, but still an excellent beer."
Saison-Brett,4.31,"Appearance: Pours a hazy yellow-orange, thick, fluffy head, great retention. Inviting indeed, would love it if the head was not just plain white. Lacing is quite good, nothing crazy though.
Smell: Hop backbone, citrusy, namely orange and grapefruit. Notes of brett and pepper.
Taste: Balanced. The citrusy hops mingle well with the brett notes. Hop bitterness is low. Brett, peppery and citrusy hops are at the top. The finish has a nice malty tinge and tastes of alcohol. As it gets warmer, the pepper notes really come through, like Tank 7.
Mouthfeel: Effervescent burn, light bodied, soft, crisp, refreshing, smooth enough, dry. It touches the lips and tongue with a gentle caress.
Overall: First off...it's not Tank 7...and that's to be expected! It's a lovely beast of its own and it's well invited. I have another already to drink down the road, in a few years...but I may get another for my birthday next year. So good!"
Saison-Brett,3.89,"Had a 2011 bottle back in September 2015. Bottle # 12235.

Pours a darker golden color, hints of mild cloudiness and with a big ol' full on head exceeding 1"". Aroma imparted notes of grain, alcohol, hay, rawhide, pepper and bitter melon.

Taste allayed my fears about this being too big and an ""imperial"" saison. 8.5% is too big normally, but somehow this kept its style guideline roots. Mouth feel stayed relatively dry and light instead of dropping an oppressive amount of alcohol. More lemon tartness in the taste than aroma. A little bit of other citrus beyond that, a pear note and a pineapple note. Minimal band aid phenol funk notes. Even though it was 4 years old, it didn't seem much different than fresher pours I've had of it.

At the end of the day its a very good beer, but the price point (around $20) is such that I dunno how often I can buy a bottle of it. A pour on tap, sure, knock it out every time. But a bottle, that is sometimes tough because you can get other ones for half the price."
Saison-Brett,4.38,"2018 on tap. Into tulip

Original rating from notes pulled from Inter-dimensional memorial travel through millions of miles of space and time away: 4.25 across the board

Oh lawd this takes me back. Wish I could get this in a 2008.

Slight amber haze with one-finger tight, ivory, sticky foam head.

Upfront barnyard funk, sweet n’ sour lemon citrus. Slight caramel and multigrain bread coming through. Fresh scythed meadow outside of Stull, Ks. Lovely

Not the same as I remembered but pretty close. Great big funky citrus lemon peel and orange pith. Brett comes
swinging through with the proto-funk like Herbie Hancock on a headhunt. Piss-soaked horse blanket that I chewed on in a dream. Splendid.

A bit tame on draft compared to the errant eruption of yesteryear. Still fizzy and bubbly, champagney(?). Slight drying with a balanced malt sweetness.

An OG in my book. just a young buck, but man was this a trip when I first had it. Several times since and I stick with my ratings. You know what? Bump that taste and feel up a notch. Worth a shot."
Saison-Brett,4.37,"Boulevard Saison Brett 2016, 8.5% ABV. Pours hazy bright orange with a foamy white 5+ finger head that left heavy lacing. Nose is grassy, malty, pepper, leather (belt, not shoe), with slight funk. Taste has lemon zest, a mashup of other fruits, pepper, dry and slightly bitter. There is a lot more going on with taste than I can describe. Outstanding mouthfeel, heavier carbonation, but not unpleasant. Overall world-class."
Saison-Brett,4.49,"2016 vintage

Pours slightly hazy amber gold with a lasting foam head. The smells are slightly malty, saisony, and earthy funky filled with Brettanomyces. Notes of caramel, honeydew melon, green banana, sweet clove spice, peppercorn, funky leather, earthy Brett notes, rubber tire, dried fruit, with floral earthy hops. Tastes pretty nice, clean honeydew melon, green banana plantain notes, tart lemon, mild apple, peppercorn clove spice, some funky earthy Brett notes like sweet leather, rubber tire, dried fruit, apricot, caramel, vanilla, bready malts, with floral herbal hops. Feels medium lighter bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a nice aged Brett saison."
Saison-Brett,4.21,"2017 vintage. Poured into a nonic. Cloudy amber. Massive bubbly head that sticks around to the end. Lots of sticky lacing. Awesome nose. Fruity aroma with some mild barnyard. A very nice start. Fruity up front, changing to clean barnyard with a long peppery finish. Light body. Overall an outstanding Saison."
Saison-Brett,4.25,"750ml bottle. 2015 vintage, best by date on label is '02-2017'.
Very cloudy, straw colored body. Big body white head upon pouring, which slowly dissolves to fluffy partial cap and ring. Leaves behind some spotty lacing.
Aroma of Brett. Barnyard, leather, and tobacco.
Taste closely follows the smell in providing a flavor of Brett, barnyard, horse blanket, leather and tobacco.
Medium mouth feel, with dryness. Very good carbonation.
This beer has a slightly tired taste but it still expresses the power of Brett."
Saison-Brett,3.95,"Thanks to Daemose for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 2012 vintage bottle, consumed on 9/3/17. Poured from 750mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Mildly hazy gold, until some of the yeast trub gets poured into the glass – then it becomes rather turbid. A half-finger of white head fades fairly quickly to a ring of foam, though there's quite a bit of visible carbonation stays around.

S: Musty barnyard and horse-blanket Brettanomyces funk with some lemony citric acid tart and pineapple as well. Biscuity malts, maybe a mild wheat character. Mild black pepper. Not a huge aroma, though appealing enough. It's less Brett-forward than I expected for this long in the bottle.

T: Lemons and citric acid tart, and Brett funk with basement and barnyard, but less fruity than the nose. Biscuit malts with a touch of caramel and oxidation – but this stays mild. Saison yeastiness with a touch of black pepper. Mild pineapple from Brett as it warms through the drink. It finishes with fruity acids mixed with the residual funk.

M: Average body, low alcohol presence. The carbonation sensation seems pretty good, especially considering the age on the bottle.

O: A pretty decent saison. As mentioned, this wasn’t quite as funky as I’d hoped. I’ve had bottles of aged Rayon Vert from Green Flash that the Brett has taken over almost completely. But even as this is, it’s good and the age hasn’t created almost any issues."
Saison-Brett,4.53,"2016 bottling, best by 1/1/18, opened 3/2/19. This is a beautiful saison. Beautiful golden yellow, medium head, massive earthy hoppy juicy aromas. Nice high carbonation hits the tongue, mellow, earthy, grassy, hoppy, sour, funky, as the carbonation recedes the hop flavor fills in beautifully. A real treat to drink, and enjoyed 14 months beyond the best by date. At $12 in the bottle shop, a real steal."
Saison-Brett,4.06,"750ml bottle into a tulip. Best by 1/16/19, so well inside the wire here.

Bit of a gusher when I popped the cork, lost about 10% of the beer. Hazy yellow/orange body with massive white head leaving layers of lacing.

Mostly a clean and fruity aroma. There is a hint of the brett funkiness. Apple and fruit smells as it warms, making for a very pleasing blend.

Dry, spicy, bitter taste. Some sweetness. Not detecting any funkiness on the tongue.

Medium to full on the mouth, the finish dries out the mouth.

Overall, a good beer, and I'm glad to have got to try it. Not something I would want a steady diet of though."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.83,"lots of foam, redish-brown, mahogany.

With some bitterness in finish. creamy, nice mouthfeel.
similarities to rochefort 10, though westy felt like had a more distinct aroma and tasted sweeter"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.56,"Best by 9/28/24, bottled 9/28/21

Here we are, review #1300!! For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium. This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple

Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time

Wow. I just had to give this one a bump in the overall. So unique and ever changing, it’s addicting. I’m so happy I picked up a 6 pack of this whale, and happy to finally have it in the books"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.7,"Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021. The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.

In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head.

The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake.

The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.

Cheers!"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.94,"Amazing Quadrupel. If you cannot get your hands on it, just go with the St. Bernardus ABT.

It gets even better with a few years age on it if stored properly with existing molasses and chocolate undertones coming out in full force. There is a reason why this is a top rated bier for decades and not just because it is difficult to obtain."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.36,So this is what a Belgian quad is supposed to taste like. Not a thing wrong with anything here. Glad I could try it.
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.68,"Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light.

Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep.

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden.

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right.

Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class.
___________________________________________

Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:

Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)

330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.

Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.

This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.

(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.44,"been holding on to this one for a while now, been finding the right excuse to have it, and i was ireland lose to belgium in the football, i decided now was as good a time as ever to have this most legendary of beers, a beer like this can never live up to its reputation, but to be fair it is damn nice, it has a complexity to it that the other two great belgian quads (sb12 and tr10) dont have so much, black bread, dark chocolate, and raisins and plum combined with almost saison-esque leathery flavours, oaky, earthy, little bit of vanilla, spice, liquorice, medium bitterness on the finish, delicate body with high levels of carbonation, little bit of warming from the alcohol, dryness on the finish, fruity flavours and spice linger, maybe not the best beer in the world, but it really is quite good, an essential for any beer enthusiast, glad i finally got to try it"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.93,"Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.62,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.24,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.

SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.

PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.

Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.

SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.

PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.84,"Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.
Poured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.
The aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.
The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.
The feel was very good, way too easy to drink. I expected something more viscous but this really works.
OA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.73,"I don’t know how old the bottle is, but purchased relatively recently and shipped from Belgium to me in Chicago. First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well. Overall this is worth the hype and I hope the style doesn’t lose its popularity anytime soon."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing. This one had rested for about 5 years. It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful stone fruit. The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world. It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world. Cheers.
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.63,"Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.

The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.

On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.

The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.

Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.

Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.9,"#89, delicious!"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,"I'm not gonna get all fucking scientific or anything... I won't be describing 20 different fruits, tastes or 20 different feelings... it's just a good beer! The taste of alcohol doesn't smack your ass down hard at all... it just happens to be perfectly balanced and that's it... St. Bernardus or Rochefort will hit you straight in the face... I can't taste the plums, cherries, orange peels and shit... all I can taste is a strong ass beer that has been done right... take it or leave it..."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.48,"Look: it looks like it's a light brown, with touches of orange, it LOOKS like light should be able to penetrate through it, but it absolutely does not

Smell: wet, damp wheat, heavy fruits, raisin bread

Taste: figs, figs, and figs. dates, a very moist cinnamon, fruit, and raisin cake, brown sugar, wood

Feel: smooth, a bit of heat, suprising as everyone says you can't detect the alcohol at all

Overall: the big question: is it the best beer ever? not as far as I can tell. it is fantastic, but it does have a bit of alcohol tang/bitterness/heat. a fantastic quad, but i'd probably take st. bernadus most days, especially because it's so much easier to get (this bottle was $39.99). no regrets, happy to cross it off the list, but i won't be seeking it out...unless I'm in belgium"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,"I am lucky that I live in a acceptable range to get the Westvleteren 12 bottles.
I always drink this beer after work or after cycling and I don't eat any sugar drinks or food before so I will taste it maximum.
This is for me the best tasting beer in the world.
Smell and taste is 5!"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,Obviously the product of divine intervention.
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.29,"Out of the bottle at Westvletern, Belgium.

It has happened: man has landed on the moon, Lindbergh flew around the world, and Raul has finally had Westvleteren 12. It feels like I have committed a crime but won’t be caught. Something unearthly is happening here… Like Shawn Kemp using a rubber or something.

I’m gone and I may not want to be found."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.29,"Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation. That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer?
This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed...
L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down.
S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.
T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.
F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.
O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed!
330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),5,"Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.

The wife asked if it was worth $50 a bottle? Is any beer “worth” $50 a bottle. Yes. Plus it’s a story of history, with a present day support of a simpler lifestyle and dedication to higher purpose."
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),4.27,Had this in Aruba …. Reputedly best beer in the world at the time. It was damn good…. Best beer in the world good?… it was good…. Not worth the 30-50 bucks I paid for it though
Nelson,4.04,"Can with unreadable date. GL Tulip.

A: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. No visible carbonation; it’s too hazy.

S: from a foot away I can smell the sweet, tropical fruitiness. Like papaya and gooseberries in syrup.

T: on first arrival, hop burn; tangy, tart, tropical, citric, floral, ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness that I actually find unpleasant. I think it’s the rye. I love rye whiskey, but I can’t think of a single rye beer I’ve liked - including this one. The hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant, as does the weird rye finish.

M: lighter side of medium, pillow-soft.

O: I saw this on the shelf ten years ago, and wanted to buy it but passed it up. I didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago, and that’s post AB acquisition. I wasn’t willing to get a six, but I saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. When this beer came out, ten years ago, it was revolutionary. Not so much today. Its beautiful to look at and smell, and is still a great example of the hazy IPA style, but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. At least it’s got a good name."
Nelson,4.37,"Nice golden hue and minimal head.
Earthy and floral notes.
Malty backbone, bitterness is on point here.
Good carbonation, nice balance.chewy.
I can't find flaws, great drinking beer."
Nelson,4.35,"Truly outstanding, but I prefer Pure Hoppiness."
Nelson,3.62,"Picked up a six pack of cans based on the rating. Best by date of 08/13/22.

Pours a clear, golden orange with hints of amber and a lovely half inch of frothy head. Carbonation looks slightly below average. A good amount of lacing as you drink, some slides and some clings. Looks as expected.

Interesting, the aroma is overall a bit sour -- wasn't expecting that. Grape, stone fruit, cantaloupe, some pine and a bit of funky earthiness and spice. Malts are lingering in the background with a light toastiness. Not sure I will like this based on the aroma, but here we go.

Has a kind of ""green"" flavor. Overall a bit sour, just like the aroma hinted. Spicy and piney hops mixed with stone fruit, cantaloupe, grape... not getting a lot of citrus or tropical fruitiness, perhaps some mango. The malts just kinda chill in the background, lending some toastiness, and maybe some of that sourness as well. Finishes pretty crisp and dry with lingering grape and grapefruit bitterness. Also getting a hint of wood near the swallow and into the finish. Well, this is certainly complex but comes off a bit like a hoppy wine... interesting.

An excellent mouthfeel. Medium bodied with average but zesty carbonation and a good amount of body/chewiness. Drinks very smooth.

I can see why this is highly rated, there is a lot of complexity in the flavor profile and it's quite unique. I can't think of another IPA I've had that tastes like this. That said, I don't really care for it. I'm going to struggle through the rest of this six pack and probably will not seek this one out again."
Nelson,3.55,"On tap at a reputable establishment. This was a hazy, pale yellow. Pretty bland overall, faint grape, muted tropical fruit, mild honey sweetness. Certainly not bad but definitely disappointing."
Nelson,4.25,"12 oz can (“PKGD 01/10/22”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Hazy amber gold with a thick, rocky head of white foam and streaky lace. Layered aromas of orange citrus, pine, stone and tropical fruit. More fruit follows in the taste with orange citrus, melon and tropical fruit, slight rye spice, pine resin and dank notes. Finishes crisp, bitter and dry. Medium body, smooth feel and moderate carbonation. Densely flavorful with plenty of unique hop character."
Nelson,4.48,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (100%), pale yellow color with a large, white head. SRM of 6. One of the haziest and most opaque beers I have seen. (4.50)

Aroma: Absolutely giant aromas of mandarin orange, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, citrus, and more tropical fruit. Green Cantaloupe Melon. Even some cinnamon spice. A bit of herbal qualities underneath. Extremely juicy and green. Huge green citrus and tropical banana.

Flavor: A giant bomb of biting mandarin orange citrus, marmalade, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, green mango, gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon altogether. Extremely green and juicy citrus with pine underneath. Finishes sweet and juicy. The green fruit is showcased here mostly in a Citra format, however some gooseberry and grape underneath, but less than I expected.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Sweet and biting. Leaves a green juiciness on the palate that is palate-wrecking.

Compared to Lagunitas Stereohopsis Volume 1, 1/3/21: Pours a lighter and much hazier color. Stronger and juicier aromas. Much more fruity and hazier. The Nelson evolves into more of a green citrus rather than green orchard fruit. More citrus, less orchard-fruit. Overall, quite a similar flavor from the Nelson which is interesting. Finishes much juicier, sweeter, but possibly a lighter body.

Compared to Toppling Goliath Pseudo Sue 1/2/22: Pours slightly hazier. Milder aromas. More mandarin orange, marmalade, and cantaloupe. Less lemon citrus and citrus flower.

Compared to Surly's Axe Man IPA 2/6/22: Pours a lighter and hazier color. Milder aromas. More gooseberry, grape, and deep and resinous tropical and berry notes. Less citrus peel, pineapple, pine, flower, and flavor complexity.

Compared to Stone Deliciousness IPA 3/4/22: Pours a hazier and lighter color. Stronger aromas. More grapefruit, sweet lemon, yellow, and green plastic flavors. Less grapefruit citrus, tangerine, and pine. Slightly less bitter. More grape flavor

Overall: What a giant and juicy IPA. Fantastic mandarin orange, pulp, green gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon flavors. Even some slight cinnamon spice. You could brush your teeth with this beer. Palate cleansing and green. The Nelson doesn't provide the green grape/gooseberry/orchardfruit I was expecting and leans more citrus. Almost like the Citra hop. Actually tastes quite similar to Toppling Goliath's PseudoSue. Would be worth a comparison to PseudoSue, Axe Man, or KIng Sue if I manage to pick this one up again. So dense, so juicy, and so good. (Final Rating: 4.48)"
Nelson,4.45,"Pours a hazy orange into a paper hotel coffee cup with a big 3"" head, excellent retention and lacing despite the vessel. Nose is tropical juice at first before turning into floral honey and pine as it warms; a hint of malt, grain, and maybe some diesel (though might be the cup). Taste is nicely balanced between sweet, juicer hop elements and a lingering bitterness on the finish. Super smooth on the palate with no hint of alcohol. Glad to finally give it a try."
Nelson,3.82,"Canned 3/10/21. Consumed from a tulip glass 8/6/21. I would have liked to have tried a fresher version, but smell and taste were both examples of the Nelson hop. Disappointing Look: very small head that was very short lived and there were solids in the beer. It was hazier than I expected. Quite hoppy. My ratings here are somewhat generous and take into account the possible effect of canning date vs. consumption date. With all the great IPAs out there I did not feel that this was a stellar example worth repeating. I was very surprised to see a 98 pt rating."
Nelson,4.85,"It smells like fresh pine and a little dank. Then the more I smell it i get some breadwater sweetness but the piny hops are the predominant scent.

Oh yeah, now I get the hype. The taste is so clean. First it's barely sweet with a hint of pine and then it's a really bright piny hoppiness.

It's not quite as thin as most IPAs with a medium body.  The finish is bitter and then dank. It lasts for a long time.

Overall it is one of the better IPAs I've had.  It's smooth, balanced and incredibly refreshing. I give this one a really great 5.7 out of 6."
Nelson,4.24,"Look is opaque orange and more hazy than you would think. Nice one finger of white head with decent retention. Smell is white white and cedar with notes of tropical fruits. Taste is white whine with grape notes. I always seem to get a wood/Cedar flavor from the Nelson Sauvignon hops. Not hating it at all. Feels soft and approachable, easy to drink. This beer is outstanding and worth its reputation"
Nelson,4.17,"From a 12oz can dated 3/9/21 into a weizen glass.

Pours an opaque orangish yellow with about two and a half fingers of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Smells of oranges, faint grapes, pineapple and pine.

Taste...Getting a white wine vibe along with slight citrus acidity (not off-putting). Oranges and grapefruit in the background.

Soft, smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste.

Overall, a really decent beer with an interesting taste."
Nelson,4.19,"It pours a golden straw color with a nice sized head.
There are aromas of rye and tropical fruit.
I’m not usually a fan of Rye IPAs. But this one is very nice The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor.
It has a nice body and mouthfeel.
Leaves a nice aftertaste. The rye works well with the bitterness.


Overall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch."
Nelson,4.57,"Pours well out of a can, head looks good, foam clings to glass, etc. Very hazy with some larger particulates floating around.

White wine-like characteristics of the hop prominent in smell, along with some mango/tropical fruit.

The most prominent flavor is ripe mango both in flavor profile and sweetness. Not getting much else but mango is awesome so that's a plus.

Robust feel but still dangerously smooth and easy to put down, even at 7%.

Would buy on sight, wife--approved and she hates IPAs."
Very HHHazyyy,4.5,"Look...the usual impeccable staw yellow with a frothy well carbonated head
Smell...overripe peach and mango with citrus tropical fruity with yeast and dank.
Taste...Boozy explosion in a good way because the drying and the underlying drying and whirlwind of flavors seem to explode and dissipate. Very intricate layering of flavors. Melon, mango, and pineapple overtones. Absolutely drenched in hop sauce
Feel...a usual pillow juicy and sticky. Tons of lacing and full character yet so easy to drink
Overall..This beer kicks some serious butt. There is no way to lose trying this beer because the boys up in Chartlon are killing it as usual. Harder for me do to differentiate from Very Hazy but still different and good"
Very HHHazyyy,4.3,"16oz can dated 5/27/22.

Pours cloudy yellow with plenty of tattered lacework and persistent retention. Peach, pineapple, and white grape in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Juicy tropicals on the palate and a bit dank with minimal malt or bitterness. Peach, pineapple, and orange pith. Finishes dry with lingering dried peach."
Very HHHazyyy,4.49,"Appearance - The beer was golden orange with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The beer had an orangey nose, perhaps a slight vanilla hint.

Taste - Orange. There was some bitterness and perhaps a bit of lemon and melon. There was a little hint of vanilla. There was a lighter bitterness at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer was thick, and modestly carbonated.

Overall - This was the winning Tree House for the evening."
Very HHHazyyy,4.68,"a: super hazy matte pale orange color with a slight copper tinge. large, 3 finger solid, yet frothy, off-white head

s: the aroma hits you as soon as you pop the can. tangerines, guava, passionfruit, and pineapple. juicy mango, dragonfruit, and a hint of tangy peach juice. some crackers in here, and some mellow orange and grapefruit. extremely juicy

t: huge hit of fresh melon right away. tangerines, clementines, ripe mango, and peach behind that. guava and kiwi. papaya and some faint sweet pineapple. my goodness, this is very tasty

m: medium mouthfeel, not extremely fluffy. carbonation is moderate, which really helps

o: absolute melon bomb here. juicy and balanced. very easy to drink and absolutely delicious - outstanding stuff"
Very HHHazyyy,5,"Poured into a 13 oz Teku glass canned on 5/27/22. Pours a Very HHHazyyy orange with a finger plus sticky white head that leaves a bunch of thick streaks of lace, with excellent retention. 5

Aroma is peach, tangerine, papaya, passionfruit, and apricot. 5

Taste peach, tangerine, papaya, passionfruit, and apricot really balanced and rather insane. 5

Mouthfeel is above average, not sticky or dry, soft creamy carbonation, and at 8.8% it has huge flavor but insanely drinkable. 5

Overall this is as good as it gets for me. Huge WOW factor. 5"
Very HHHazyyy,4.9,"#125, yummy!"
Very HHHazyyy,4.61,"From a 16oz can dated 5/27/22 into a tulip. Can message: Beer...Beer...Beer...Diddly Beer...

Pours a thick opaque light yellowish, brownish orange with about two and a half fingers of slightly off-white head. Incredible retention and lacing.

Huge aroma. Smells of mangoes, mandarins, peaches and canteloupe. Some earth in the background on warming.

Taste is bitterness up front-earth and pine with juice in the background-citrus and mango. nice balance of juice and bitterness.

Soft, full-bodied, thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Citrus rind aftertaste.

Yeah, well, this is incredible. Incredibly balanced for a bigger beer."
Very HHHazyyy,4.71,"16 oz can. It says ""It had to happen"". Well so did this review.

Pours a muddy pale gold color with a finger of fluffy, effervescent white head. Smaller head than expected, but the retention is real. Leaves a massive crown of lacing along the top of the glass.

Oh my dear lord the smell of this beer. How is there no fruit puree here? There's a nuclear amount of stone fruit, as well as some fresh mango, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit pith. The signature Tree House yeast is also very present with a hint of vanilla.

The flavor follows the nose to a T, but adds a nice vanilla bean character, as well as some melon and fruit stripe bubblegum. This is just stupid.

The feel is medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft. A hint of booze.

Overall, this beer is absolutely deserving of any hype it receives. I am a long admitted Tree House fanboy, but I'd consider myself well-versed with NEIPA's and can tell which ones are good and which ones are not, regardless of bias. This one is unquestionably good."
Very HHHazyyy,4.61,"Hazy is a good description of the look. The smell jumps out to you from 18” away persuading you to “drink me”. Taste is very pleasant, feels good in the mouth and going down. Love this beer."
Cable Car Kriek,4.47,Still a great beer. Newer version.
Cable Car Kriek,5,This is for the 375mL release in February of 2022 from OG kegs the brewery found. This beer was nothing short of amazing! The funk and the cherry flavour was so deep and full with a nice sour level and soft on the mouthfeel. Chased this for a long time and it lived up to all the hype my head created for it.
Cable Car Kriek,4.64,"L: Bright and clear ruby red and strawberry hues with a small foamy white head
S: Slight funk and ripe cherries
T: Follows the nose with crisp montmorency/balaton flavors coupled with slight hay and granny smith apple notes and minimal acidity
F: Moderate carb and body
O: Extremely well done and easy drinking wild ale - glad to have tried this!"
Cable Car Kriek,4.1,"Batch 2. Was light, little acid on it, did not have the regular mouth feel of regular Cable Car. Smooth in beginning, nice red color to it. Body was on thinner side"
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.53,"Untappd backlog, from 10/12/2019."
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.04,"The last thing I expected to be at FOBAB was an old whale I never thought I would tick, but here we are and I'm so happy!

Despite all that, I can settle myself and dig in. As I do, here in this 8 ball black, short mocha headed ale, I get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. There's just a little bite of slightly herbal wood, which I think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.

I can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what I did there?), but in today's world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak, it's quite underwhelming."
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.43,Can courtesy of JohnnyHops.
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.36,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.

Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.

Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.

The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.

Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.

I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!"
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.29,"2021 release. Great smell of raspberry jam right upon cracking the can. Dualing raspberry and cocoa powder on the palate, with a shot of bourbon as a chaser. Excellent barrel character. Good legs for 12% ABV, but slightly thinner than expected."
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.58,So much raspberry. Made me think of chocolate covered raspberry with just a little bourbon
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.29,"Appearance - Poured into a sampler, the beer was a murky deep black color with a dark tan head.

Smell - Raspberries were strong in the nose, paired with a definite bourbon presence.

Taste - Raspberry is tough to capture in a beer. The raspberry seemed fresh, without overdoing it or making it seem artificial. The sweetness is balanced by roasted malts and a little bourbon sting. The finish was slightly warming, though never overly sweet.

Mouthfeel - Before there were slushies with gobs of fruit puree, Haymarket made a nice thick stout with fruit.

Overall - I enjoyed this beer as the raspberries were well presented and not artificial tasting."
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.25,Wakefest 2019; well balanced with raspberries on the backedge
Clare's Thirsty Ale,4.6,"Pours black with a finger of mocha head.
Smells of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, light barrel.
Taste is dark chocolate, huge fresh raspberry, vanilla, barrel, dark fruits.
Full enough body, good carb levels.
Overall an excellent fruited stout!"
Iris,4.33,"Appearance - The beer poured a hazy shade of amber his a huge bubbly white head. This beer could not wait to get out of the bottle!

Smell - The nose was like a rustic dry sour presence with a definite green apple presence.

Taste - The profile was pleasantly Earthy. It initially had a floral quality that brought to mind herbal tea. Also included were notes of oak, lime, and green apples. The sour notes were steady, not screaming for attention or melting dental fixtures. The beer had a nice dry finish.

Mouthfeel - After the head finished rising, the carbonation was only moderately intense.

Overall - This was a solid lambic, though not necessarily one I would seek again."
Iris,4.33,"2021 bottling. Medium amber in the glass with some haziness and a finger of dense off-white head that retains fairly well and leaves minimal lacing. The maltiness here is quite unique indeed, almost like a Flanders Red -- getting some toastiness and cherry pie notes in the aromas and flavors. Moderately acetic with a fluffy and lively effervescence. The hops impart a lightly bitter herbal flavor, but it's not too overwhelming and compliments the oaky barrel character. Happy new year!

Iris,4.32,"750mL bottle into a Teku
Bottled: 25 Feb 2019

Pours translucent with the slightest degree of haze. Golden copper in color with 2 fingers width of off white colored head. Aroma is very floral, grassy fields, some nondescript fruity esters and pungent cheese like funk. Tart citrus acidity rounds out the aromas. Very complex nose. Taste is somewhat tart upfront but not nearly to the degree of most Cantillons I’ve had and it’s also notably more funky with barnyard and pungeant cheese like funk. Prominent bitterness on the finish. There is a fairly prominent sweetness to balance. Mouthfeel is vibrant with high carbonation and excellent drinkability. Overal, far from my favorite Cantillon but a complex and exceptionally well done beer.

Iris,4.34,"750 ml corked and capped green bottle, vintage 2007, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6%. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate off-white head. Beguiling complex aroma, notes of farmhouse, rustic kitchen, oxidised apples, apple cider vinegar and hops. The flavour is sour but not extreme, hints of oxidised apples and spices, unlike other lambics it also has a distinct hoppy bite in the finish."
Iris,4.43,"Dec 2014 bottle opened Jan 2021. Cork perfect, amber-copper color, small white head, minimal lacing. Nose light funk, barnyard, grapefruit. Taste very complex, sourness seems to be both acetic and lactic, leaning on lactic, apple, grapefruit, mild bitterness, leather, earthy, dry finish."
Iris,4.53,"Poured a burnt orange color with a tall slight beige head. Strong hop aroma without distracting that classic lambic funk. Flavors start out really delicate and mild with notable hops. Vinous quality with hints of grapefruit. Then it gets all sorts of nuances as it warms up. Grapefruit rind becomes more robust. Vinous quality kicks in as well as the hoppy bitterness. A nice tang without overwhelming acidity. This is quite unlike other Cantillon’s I have tried. Far more hoppy than their traditional beers, heavy grapefruit. I love it."
Iris,4.42,"750ml bottle - March, 2016 Vintage ('15/'16 cork) poured into a wine stem at 45°F.

Pours a very unique scarlet reddish-orange - slightly foggy, with zero head production, and just a razor-thin tan collar. No visible effervescence.

Nose: The aroma begins to fill the area as soon as it is opened. Oak, first and foremost. Tons of damp, musty, splintery white oak, with a whisper of acetone. There's some dusty grain, water cracker, green apple, apricot, fresh pumpkin, tangerine, grass, hay, rose water, flowers, fresh linen, grapefruit zest, raspberry, band aid, sea shell minerality, lemon, dried leaves, leather, old parchment, and some quiet farmhouse funk. Some nutty malt appears as it opens up. This is exceedingly complex and fragrant, with these beautiful floral, almost perfumey undertones.

Palate: Iris greets the palate with a bright, zippy acidity, which leans mostly acetic, with some apple cider vinegar. Immediately, it's so mineralic, that it almost lends a salty note - like sea shells. Complexity quickly unfurls, with notes of tart green apple, lemon, lemongrass, overripe apricot, overripe cherry, white wine, pear, wild green herbs, with a grassy, almost vegetal touch, raspberry, grapefruit zest, flower petals, cracked black pepper, and on the back end, a distinct thread of ripe brie cheese. There's some subtle lambic funk as well, lending a bit of sweat, fruit rot, and damp soil. Parallel to all of this, is a reserved malt presence, with a kiss of caramel and toasted bread, and after about an hour, a lovely malty nuttiness develops. Approaching the finish, the acidity slowly begins to curve, as a herbal, slightly pithy bitterness emerges, with grass, grapefruit rind, tonic water, arugala, and a leafy, spicy, Nobel-esque hop note. As the acidity disappears, a long lingering finish of dry white oak, bitter grapefruit pith, and hop resin concludes the sip.

Mouthfeel/Body: In typical lambic fashion, Iris is fairly light in body, although there is a roundness to it, as well as some malt weight. Effervescence is quite low - perhaps to its detriment, which also lends a fuller feel, as well as a slickness. The acidity is quite tart - sour, even, but remains shy of puckering. Dry, but not bone dry, with some pronounced tannic drying in the bitter finish.

Overall: A very unique offering that stays true to everything Cantillon is known for. While not technically a lambic because of the use of barley malt, it certainly retains most of the traditional Cantillon lambic characteristics, with an interesting malt element, and a whole other dimension of complexity from the unique hop treatment. It isn't ""hoppy"", but the hops certainly contribute some floral and bitter depth. Complex, cohesive, mature, and unique, yet entirely Cantillon and approachable. Definitely worth trying."
Iris,4.36,"Amber hued with a fingernail of off white around a third of the rim and covering a quarter of the top. Lightly murky in complexion. The aroma is of light barley and lightly funky lambic yeast. I’m tasted earthy malted barley, light funk, and oak. The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisp."
Iris,4.52,"Pours a cloudy, deep, dark amber coloration with a medium, frothy head that soon fades to a thin ring inside the glass and slightly visible carbonation. Smells of light biscuity malt and estery and hoppy fruit notes of green apple, apricot, grapefruit and white grape, as well as hints of blue cheese funk, rose petals and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of light biscuity malt, slighty tart and estery yeast and somewhat zesty hop notes of green apple, apricot, pink grapefruit, tangerine, white grape and peach, with some flowery accents, a distinct, somewhat tannic oak presence and pretty light blue cheese funk. Finishes semi-dry with a light bitterness, medium acidity and some pink grapefruit, white grape, peach and tannic oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While I wasn't a huge fan of Cuvée Saint Gilloise, their other dry-hopped Lambic, I actually rather enjoyed this one due to the hops feeling more fruity and zesty here and not being quite as floral and earthy, intermingling very harmoniously with the esters and acidity to the point where you almost can't tell anymore where the fruity esters and lactic acidity end and and the fruity, zesty hops begin, although there clearly are some very distinct white grape and peach notes to this which, along with the oaky tannins a and dry character, almost evokes a certain white wine feel here, while the funk is somewhat soft and mild, but still distinct in its own way. A very unique and unusual, quite hoppy, Lambic that feels rather light and refreshing, but still has a good, soft complexity and sublime balance of sweetness, bitterness and acidity, with an intoxicating aroma of rose petals, citrus fruit and oaky, tannic funk. Vintage 2019/20, 10 weeks old at time of consumption."
Iris,4.49,2011 vintage. Consumed 12/31/15. This bottle was purchased at the brewery in 2011. Sour and delicious. Nicely round on the palate. Good carbonation.
Iris,4.44,"(75 cl bottle, 6.5% abv, bottled: 25 February 2019; purchased at the brewery... shared between 2 oversize wine glasses)

L: cloudy amber liquid; excellent foam stand on pour, creamy cap after collapse; no lace

S: first whiff, explosively fragrant - floral punch, band-aid phenol... sweat, hay... perfumy linen, hint of dried apricot?... late, granola with dried citrus peel

T: grapefruit pith, tonic water; floral, herbal, funky greeting, surprisingly malty, bready as it goes... cereal malt relatively present in the aftertaste, semi-dry, mellow nuttiness; a mild subtly peppery-spicy, grassy bitterness... funk coloring the ends with sedate highlighting

F: feathery texture, subtle silty follow-through, quiet rinse drop to its finish... little friction across the palate, little residual mark

O: moderately-intense in its ghostly expressions of flavors... already looking forward to trying it again; can't help feeling a subtlety or two passed me by... saw this at a few Monk's (draft) events, but this is my first sampling (1587)"
Iris,4.29,"2019 bottle at Cantillon Brewery.
Amber orange color with a thick thin head that kept constant throughout the degustation.
Pungent sour aroma with notes of lemon, funky party, spices, grapefruit, leather, white grapes and oak.
Flavor with notes of lemon, malt, grapefruit, white pepper, white grapes, clear noble hops, peaches, white wine, horse sweat, earth, mild lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with a sour finish.
Medium body with appropriate carbonation.
Quite complex and more like beer compared to their sisters. I liked the fact this is made just with barley malt; it felt more malt assertive making other nuances more visible. Also, it is sure more bitter than its counterparties. I guess this is how several beers were in the past. It brings lots of grapefruit, oak, lemony and Saaz hops notes."

Punkin Ale,4.04,"Poured from a bottle into pint glass.

Appearance: Amber/orange. Hazy like a NEIPA.

Smell: Pleasant, with a spicy aroma. Strong pumpkins and pepper aromas dominate. Some caramel aroma to a lesser extent.

Taste: Very nice and a unique taste. I can definitely taste the pumpkin, and there are some spicy flavors which makes for a unique taste. I like this better than other pumpkin ales I have tried.

This is an interesting seasonal beer. I will buy this again."
Punkin Ale,4.5,With bold intuition the punkin ale screams into the flailing last vestiges of summer to declare itself the harbinger of a fall that may or may not ever come

Normally, I do not care for pumpkin beers nor winter warmer-type brews but for the price, I could not pass it up...
Definitely taste the spice and pumpkin essences...
Good with some goat cheese and other snacks that I had on hand like Triscuits...
Big fan of Dogfish Head although, I worry that the quality is going to be on the decline now that Sam Adams / Boston Brewing has bought them out..."
Punkin Ale,4.59,"Very much enjoyed this beer from Dogfish Head. It is bold with the pumpkin and cinnamon spices, but if you like those flavors, it is worth a try. I plan on making it a part of my fall rotation."
Punkin Ale,4.18,"Punkin Ale brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.00% This Pumpkin Beer pours out of a glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this brew is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold Pumpkin, Sweet, Spicy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Punkin Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the opportunity to. Dogfish Head Craft Brewery did a super nice job with this style of brew."
Punkin Ale,3.76,"12oz bottle from Brewers Haven. Clear amber, thin tight head. Aroma is pumpkin with light savory notes. Taste offers light cinnamon, pumpkin. Pretty simple and focused on the pumpkin."
Punkin Ale,3.49,"Punkin from Dogfish Head. Purchased 18/9/21 from Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA for $3.18 (Including tax)/12 oz bottle ($ 0.265/oz). On room temperature shelf at store. Stored at home at 40 degrees. Reviewed 19/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Appearance – 4.
First pour – Pale gold (SRM 3) with slight greenish tint, clear.
Body – Deep gold (SRM 6), faint haze. When rear-lite, same.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), darker than floral white and lighter than Dutch white, medium density, average retention, diminishing to a three mm crown and a complete cap with a few rocks.
Lacing – Poor. A few drag marks as the level drops.
Aroma – 3.75 – Light pumpkin spices, predominantly clove and allspice, no malt, no hops, no yeast, no pumpkin.
Flavor – 3.25 – Flavor follows nose - no yeast, no malt, lightly sweet and no hops. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3.5 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.5 Billed as “Brown ale brewed with pumpkin and spices” but there are darn few brown ale characteristics and the pumpkin appears imaginary. My fruit fly drinking buddy, however, has a fatal attraction to it."
Punkin Ale,3.65,"This happened to be on tap at a local Cajun restaurant so I gave it a try. Poured into a shaker pint. Golden yellow color with some head and good curtain lacing. Smell was disappointing but slightly cinnamony. Pumpkin spice flavor subtle but distinct. Flavor of cinnamon and all spice. Overlay, I am happy I gave it a try."
Punkin Ale,4,The pumpkin binge rolls on through October. Dogfish is next up with their Pumkin Ale. A totally different approach to the category with no pumpkin sweetness and a strong bitter spice. It is very easy drinking and a lighter fall ale. Rating: 80
Punkin Ale,4,"Had on tap at Special Brews Lynnwood, WA"
Punkin Ale,3.89,Tried this again this year (2022) and it left a much better impression on me. I like the brown ale base a lot and this time I didn't feel underwhelmed. It was still typical of other pumpkin beers but I'd get this again for sure
Punkin Ale,3.49,"Appearance:
Pure, translucent amber with a finger of off-white fizz that bolts quicker than a politician faced with a lie detector.

Bouquet:
Stale gourd husk with a cinnamon stick lodged up its buttocks far enough to be considered “distant.” The sad introduction is a forgivable offense because, as it airs, it exudes a mild aroma of sweet yams baked in butter and warming, fall spices.

Feel:
A slick yet girthy medium distinguished by fine, champagne bubbles and a comfy, long-lingered, pumpkin finish.

Taste:
Like being lured into a cozy, life-sized gingerbread house by the scent of fresh pumpkin pie… only to be knocked senseless by a cannibal witch with a tire iron: Starts with pumpkin pie filling on a gingerbread pie crust that’s abruptly interrupted by a savagely acrid, burnt copper aftertaste. This unwanted assault slowly desists as the beer airs but d@mned if it ain’t a horrible first impression… blegh.

Overall:
Let it breathe or pay the price. Don't wait too long though, gotta drink it while its still cold. Very nice once those harsh introductions are over."
Punkin Ale,4.25,"Smells a lot like pumpkin spice and it's malty sweet.  There does seem to be the herbal bite of hops in there too.
It starts a little bitter.  Then the sweetness comes, it's mellow and squashy.

The mouthfeel is thin and there's plenty of carbonation.  The finish is where it really feels like Fall.  Pumpkin and warming spices.

This is so good.  It's balanced, subtle and nuanced.  I give it a 5.1 out of 6."
Punkin Ale,3.9,"12oz bottle. Bottom neck is stamped for best by date of 'Jan 2022',
Mostly clear, pale gold colored body. Aggressive pour brought forth a two finger milky white head. Attractive tiny rising bubble show. A nearly full wall of lacing follows down the body.
Aroma of toasted malts layered with pumpkin spices and brown sugar.
Taste is a well balanced blend of toasted malts, brown sugar and pumpkin spices. Gives off a gourd vibe.
Medium mouth feel. Good, supportive carbonation.
Very pleasant tasting fall seasonal with reminders of pumpkin with its spices, brown sugar, and a backbone of malts."
Punkin Ale,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Appearance is a dark copper or amber color, with more than a finger's worth of head, decent retention and lacing.

Aroma: pumpkin, cinnamon, brown sugar, toasted malts, nuts, nutmeg, spices/allspice, and clove.

Pumpkin is the most notable note while the nuts, malts, and nutmeg provide a backbone with the sweetness of the cinnamon and brown sugar. Body is medium-light."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,"Bottled December, 2016

Color on the pour is an interesting reddish brown. Once in the glass it settles into a deep, deep brown with just the faintest of red. Almost no head, but a mocha colored ring persists. Excellent legs.

Aroma is rich and boozy. The bourbon / barrel are both there, but so are notes of chocolate, molasses, figs and more. . Very nice smelling beer.

As for taste, unsurprisingly the coffee has faded and I honestly can't even detect it. That said, I'm not sure it matters all that much, as what's still there is great. For my first few sips I was getting lots of barrel / bourbon, but as my palate has adjusted the depth of the beer became more noticeable. Nothing is in your face. The chocolate, roast, barrel etc. are all subtle enough that each sip leaves a slightly different impression.

Nice light alcohol warmth and amazingly full, chewy mouthfeel. Maybe I've given a 5 on feel before, but if so, I don't know when. For my tastes, this has a perfect feel.

Overall, while I wish I'd tried one of these fresh, it's clear that this is a very well-crafted beer that has held up well over time, even without the coffee element."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,"2016 vintage poured into a HF wine glass

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a film, leaving some lacing behind

S- aroma jumps out of the glass with barrel character; bourbon, wet oak, caramel vanilla, toasted coconut and toffee. The base beer provides notes of nutty fudge, black licorice, dark chocolate, charred malt, molasses, brown sugar & leather. Also picking up a hint of orange truffle

T- sweet and malty initially, with a bit dark chocolate note, along with black strap molasses and brown sugar. Mid-palate brings out a bold barrel note, adding barrel juice, oak, caramel and vanilla. As it nears the close, notes of chocolate fudge, caramel, walnut and charred malt emerge. The linger gives more oaky bourbon and chocolate

M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns creamy into a silky, slightly warming finish

O- bold barrel notes are complimented by a fantastic base beer, well done"
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.66,"Bottle pour is deep and almost fully opaque brown with thin tan head.

Rich and roasted coffee aroma with smooth and sweet bourbon.

Layers of roasty malt, coffee bean and toffee, smooth bourbon layers of flavor.

Moderate and soft carbonation and rich and medium body.

Excellent, loads of flavor depth which evolves as the temperature changes."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.95,"Pours night black with a beautiful light brown colored head, which slowly fades to a coating layer of lacing atop the liquid.

Smell is of spicy, toasty bourbon barrel, earthy coffee and a good amount of burned rock sugar atop.

This has a silk, lighter mouthfeel mouthfeel, featuring a heavier, yet well balanced beer.

Tastes of bakers chocolate, boozy pralines and warming, oaken bourbon among layers upon layers of milk chocolate and accompanying licorice. This gets enhanced by chocolaty, wooden coffee, which inherits a gently, well dosed sweet peak, adding to the rich malt foundation of the beer. Finishes with less roast, more whipped cream covered milk chocolate and a light dryness, resulting from burned malts and a more pronounced coffee presence.

Sweet, smooth and well balanced - this drinks almost too easy for what it is. The coffee in this does not stand out too much on its own, but rather enriches the beer in a pleasant way."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.71,"500 mL bottle into a snifter

2013 vintage

Damn, aging has done a little bottle of beer well. Decadent brew with aromas of vanilla bean, coffee and toasted oak, with an alcohol-warming tinge at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are as smooth as a seven-year cellared wine (oh wait, that's basically what this is), as notes of milk chocolate, creamy lactose and oaky astringency make an eminently drinkable brew, masking all but a smidge of the alcohol. Creamy, viscous complexion is confirmed by its latte-like appearance. This is a good beer."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.35,"Aroma has sweet malt syrup and some woody notes. Taste has bittersweet wood, malt syrup and roasty coffee bitterness on the finish."
Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.74,"2018 vintage - drank on 7/14/2019. Unbelievable how much a barrel does to this beer. It's tremendously thick and the coffee is warm, lightly roasty, and sweet. Incredible beer."

Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.04,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. PKG 07APR22, so this is almost four months old.

Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.

Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

T---Tart grapefruit. Again, subtle, which is a whole lot better than most folks do with adding fruit flavor. Hoppy with a little bit of pine.

F---Medium bodied and well carbonated. Lightly quenching from the grapefruit.

O---A very nice one."
Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.73,Really fantastic. One of the most refreshing IPAs. Ballast Point has a super great flavor developed here with awesome balance. Not too bitter but definitely hoppy enough you know you’re into an IPA

Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.21,"Canned 3/10/21

As mentioned in my Sculpin review (last night), this was also one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. Thusly, I never got around to actually reviewing it. At the time I just knew that I liked it, but couldn't articulate what about it I liked. Finally, 3 years later it's getting an actual review. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy amber gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Obviously some hops can give off a pithy grapefruit character, but it's easy to tell that it's just straight up grapefruit used in this one. I'm picking up on aromas of fresh ruby grapefruit, bready malt, white pepper, earthy hops, and light pineapple

In the OG, the aroma is far superior to the taste. Here, they meet in the middle and equalize, matching each others intensity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, sweeter grapefruit juice, grassy hops, bready malt, and light lemon. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, orange rind, bready malt and light pine

A light medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet biting beer. Finishes mostly dry without much sweetness

It's good, great even. But it doesn't match the smoothness of the original. Definitely a worthy variant and it stands on its own as a good beer"
Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.31,"It's been some years since I had this as one of my neighbors gave me a can he purchased in Cincinnati. For a few years after Sculpin was widely available locally, but now I rarely see it. In any case, it had the great hop bitterness of regular Sculpin -- with grapefruit on top. I liked it, but have not sought it out."
Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.1,"Obviously very citrussy scent with the sweetness of a little malt.

The taste is almost exclusively bitter which is good and then the grapefruit and some bready malts.

It's thin with moderate carbonation.  The finish is actually both bready and a little citrus.

Overall it's a very solid IPA.  I give it a 4.9 out of 6."
Sculpin - Grapefruit,3.73,"Have seen this around forever and bought a six. Not impressed. Has a nice puffy head and plenty of lace, but it tastes like grapefruit peel and is more bitter than anything else. Won't be buying again...."
Sculpin - Grapefruit,3.79,"For a fresh pack im kind of disappointed. Feel is great there is definitely a grapefruit taste so that's a win but the hops don't come through as much taste wise. The overall feel is great though.

Upping the taste a little bit as since this is a variation the grapefruit should be the featured flavor and I did get it"
Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.51,"First off this is definitely my favorite grapefruit beer of all time..Its been awhile since I've seen it on the shelves but it just showed up at my local hipster, labodega, gourmet beer store so I was enticed to pick up a can. ..

The date shows that it's only a month and a half old which is game on for an ipa, and I've had it in the past so it was like running into an old friend that your actually happy to see..

I poured this beauty into my speigelau IPA glass and got a perfect 2 finger head with a slight carmelized note and a pure strong grapefruit scent like no-other beer I've ever experienced...

Like I said before, best grapefruit beer on the market period!!! And at a solid 7% abv you can't go wrong!!! HOMERUN!!!!"
Sculpin - Grapefruit,4.42,"I have had this beer from draft, bottle, and can. By far the draft is the most fresh of course, but all versions are enjoyable.

Look: Clear and light golden in color with a decently long lasting two fingers of white head

Smell: Immediately can smell the grapefruit notes up front, otherwise is just nice and fresh smelling

Taste: Again, up front is initially strong notes of grapefruit and floral fading to the more hoppy IPA, not too bitter though

Feel: Easy to drink, not too heavy nor too rich, good amount of carbonation

Overall: This is a solid go to IPA that is further improved upon by the grapefruit aspect. Perfect for a summer afternoon"

Aroma of citrus (lots of grapefruit) and piney hops, with a sweeter malt base. When the nose is taken away from the glass, the grapefruit is picked up again.
Taste is grapefruit citrus, resin, and piney hops. Good honey malt base. The hops yield a classic bitterness. The hops and some sweetness linger into the aftertaste.
Just about medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation. Very clean in expression.
Really a solid example of the West Coast IPA, and the grapefruit adds positively to the bitterness angle. This remains a classic beer recipe."

T: Grapefruit juice bitterness upfront, some malt sweetness and then it finishes with citrus pith bitterness.
M: Body is somewhere between light and medium.
O: So refreshing! The grapefruit is well balanced within. Well done. Actually the only fruit infused beer that I would buy again and again."
312 Urban Wheat,3.5,"A light, refreshing summer offering. It doesn't quite come off as a wheat ale. A subtle lemony citrus character with a light biscuit flavor. Very crushable and good for what it is"
312 Urban Wheat,3.51,"Slightly hazy straw yellow with a modest and short lived white head.
The aroma is crackers and a hint of lemon.
The taste is fresh biscuits, hints of banana, lemon and cloves.

Altogether, this is a refreshing and enjoyable wheat ale. Should be good for a warm summer day."
312 Urban Wheat,3.91,"Purchased in 2022, looks like they updated the packaging to a more modern look so I am giving it a plus for that. The smell and taste are more present than I would imagine from a wheat ale, plus for that. Citrus flavor that stands out the most, really refreshing and the carbonation isn't extreme but good enough to feel smooth going down. Absolutely recommend on a hot day."
312 Urban Wheat,3.52,smell is very light. the taste isn’t bad typical wheat beer flavor. one of the better wheat beers i’ve had. the feel is nice and light as well. overall i think it’d be a great summer lounge beer
312 Urban Wheat,3.02,"Pours a pale yellow with a white head that fades quickly, spotty lacing.
Smells grassy, grainy, wheat, tastes is similar.
Thin body, not much carbonation.
It's drinkable on nice day, just not my ""glass of beer""."
312 Urban Wheat,1.16,practically nothing. practically water
312 Urban Wheat,3.03,"Pours pale yellow with a 1"" white head, which fades to a wisp. Minimal lacing. Hazy.

Aroma is floral, grass, bread.

Taste is light citrus, slight spiciness, wheat, yeasty.

Thin bodied, moderate carbonation. Dry finish.

Rather mild tasting wheat ale."
312 Urban Wheat,3.2,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.69. Poured into a hefe glass.

L - Hazy goldenrod with a three-finger sudsy, thick cream head.
S - Bubblegum and wheat. Spray-starch. Slight lemon peel.
T - Exactly the same as the smell.
F - Well-carbonated and sudsy. Clean finish. Wet. Very approachable.
O - An alright choice for a mid-day beer. The perfect beer to review as my 100th BA beer! I'll be honest - the flavor and scent profiles are simplistic even for the style, but the feel makes up for it all. It's nice and refreshing, and would honestly pair well with any sort of summer fare. It's an incredibly drinkable wheat ale, with plenty of inoffensive qualities. It's just that nothing really stands out, except for the beautiful three-finger head that lingers to the completion of the brew. This is going to sound a bit silly, but it's almost like drinking dishwater - but in a weirdly good way. I'd buy this again as a beer to offer house guests, but not so much for myself."
312 Urban Wheat,3.29,"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a white cap that lingers, minimal spotty lacing. Aroma is mild, lemon. Flavor follows the nose. Feel is light bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall a decent beer without any real pluses."
312 Urban Wheat,3.24,"Picked this one up at the local liquor store because I remember going to Chicago Cubs games as a kid and seeing 312 being advertised and sold all over the place. I thought why not give this one a try on this beautiful Memorial Day here in Michigan. I will say the bottle on this one is beautiful. I am a guy who drinks straight out of the bottle and I will say this is one nice-looking bottle compared to your other generic wheat beers. This beer has a very wheaty smell and to me smells just like a ""beefed-up"" version of a typical American lager such as Miller or Coors. That smell goes right into the taste because this is a very wheaty/grainy tasting beer. While it is filling, this is a smooth beer that would go great with a day on the lake. A nice 6 pack of this stuff will serve you will an incredible day on a summer day."
312 Urban Wheat,3.43,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.4%. Pale golden colour, hazy when the yeast is poured in, moderate white head.

312 Urban Wheat,3.75,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Hazy, golden color in appearance. Decent retention and lacing.

Notes of wheat, lemongrass, citrus and citrus peels (particularly lemon), cloves, banana, coriander, and pepper.

Tastes like a standard wheat beer, but that's pretty much it. Has a nice lemon twang to it, and tastes refreshing. Body is medium-light."
Enjoy By IPA,4.6,Stone Enjoy by 4-20-22 Hazy IPA 9%. Smell is a bit dank & tropical with a little alcohol. I can taste a hint of alcohol followed by the tropical sweetness and nice hop flavor on the back end that lingers. This is another winner by Stone Brewing.
Enjoy By IPA,4.53,"Appearance:
Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc."
Enjoy By IPA,4.84,"Enjoy By 7/04/21 has a very thick, off-white head, a hazy, orange appearance, filled with tan sediment, and moderate lacing. The aroma is of meaty hops and light malt. The flavor is of bitter, white bread crust, and fruit. Enjoy By 7/04/21 has a high-medium body and a somewhat viscous mouthfeel. The drinker will find a dry finish.

Enjoy By IPA,4.08,"Enjoying 1/1/21 version on 2/3/21. Unfiltered, but I would not have known except it was labeled as such. Smell is of orange, mango and banana bread. Taste and mouthfeel: Follows smell, citrus up front, creamy in the middle, with strong bitterness at end. But this is Stone. I've had better Enjoy Bys but the state of my tongue is always changing. Maybe I've had more good DIPAs since the first sampling of this beer.

Another DIPA (looking at you Hopslam) which appear regularly, but like an aging actor who has not realized younger and more sought-after options are grabbing the prime spots, refuses to lower prices. More people are passing. I saved $7 on this sixer by waiting two weeks after the Enjoy By date before picking it up. It was no worse, but not any better, either. And I doubt it was because I purchased it after 1/1/21."
Enjoy By IPA,4.1,"Reviewing Enjoy By 01.01.21.

Putting all of this series in a single is a bit unfair because each is unique and some are better than others.

Pours a translucent orange with a small short lived head.

Smells of malt and piney hops. Tastes of malt and hops in good balance. As the glass warms light citrus and floral tastes come out. Finish is slightly bitter with some alcohol warmth.

Medium body with light carbonation.

I have had several earlier editions of this series and my recollections are they all were more adventuresome and unique than this one. It's not bad at all. It's a well made straight forward mild mannered strong IPA."

Smell: Pine, fresh cut citrus, tropical fruit, maybe some grape and peach, and just a hint of solvent. A lot going on.

Taste: Nicely hoppy, lots of citrus, pine, tropical fruit, some peach and pineapple, bready malt for balance, and a sharp bitter finish with pine and grapefruit.

Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, very smooth and approaching creamy thickness. Sticky on the teeth and some lingering spiciness on the tongue.

Ruthless Rye IPA,3.64,"Poured from a Sierra Nevada sampler 12-pack glass bottle into a flared-lip tulip/IPA-style custom drinking glass. Very thick white head that stayed resilient for a short while. You can taste the rye backing up the hops with this one. Has a slightly different bitter background other than hops. Finishes less dry than other IPA's. Has a mild sweetness that blends well. The nose is more prominent than other in this sampler pack. Almost rustic; sweet, pleasant and malty. A darker color than usual IPA's, as to be expected with the rye. A brown color, almost like an amber beer was mixed with 1/4th west coast ipa. In the nucleated glass I poured it into, its maintained persistent carbonation bubbles rising to the top. More so than a lot of other IPA's to an extent. Not overly carbonated though. Maintains a thin, but thicker than usual lacing even minutes later. A good amount of carbonation, maybe the slightly higher end but still in a good way, as per usual with most Sierra Nevada beer's I've tried so far.

Overall a tasty beer and a nice experience, coming from someone new to rye beers."
Ruthless Rye IPA,4.19,"Poured from a bottle , almost clear amber/copper color with bubbly off white head leaving substantial thick bubbly lacing. Nose is spicy and malty with hints of piney hops.

Ruthless Rye IPA,3.77,"Poured a clear burnt orange color. A moderate head with good retention. A sweet citrusy and maltyaroma. The taste is dry, spicy, and quite bitter. A bitter, but pleasant aftertaste. More carbonated than most. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Ruthless Rye IPA,3.6,"Pours a clear copper/amber with average head but excellent lacing.

Aromas of bready malt, toasted rye, and hints of citrus.

The flavor carries a wide variety of notes. Bready malt, toasted rye, floral, and citrus all show up until the finish, where the piney hops arrive.

The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, and rather slick, with carbonation lacking.

This is an interesting rye brew but not top flight."
Ruthless Rye IPA,3.99,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom taster pint; bottled on 3/18/19.
A: Pours a basically clear (precipitation on the glass made this a tough call), dark amber, really more copper color with one finger, off white head, solid retention, much more than a cap, and lacing.
S: Aromas of mocha, caramel, cocoa, molasses, and light pine.
T: Semisweet. The palate certainly follow the nose, but the caramel/molasses maltiness and piney core is now front and center. Solid bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with excellent carbonation and a full, creamy presence.
O: A top shelf Rye IPA. Really a treat."

Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, some heat from the alcohol

The lack of carbonation isn't doing this any favors, guessing I'm missing out on the intended experience."
Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.77,"Good runner up to the Original Prairie Bomb. Pours a very dark, opaque brown-black, with a thin tan head. This stout strikes with coffee first, then chocolate and boozy-vinalla. Less complex Taste than the original prairie bomb, with a thick full-bodied mouth feel. Disguise the booziness more and your Prairie Bombs will go straight to the top of the beer cult classic list"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.46,"Bottled 2016 (I think? It’s hard to read)
Consumed 4/12/20

I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,4.04,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.

A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.

S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms.

T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.

M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation.

O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great."

Assassin,4.21,"On tap at Ansari's in Eagan MN the other day (the 2021version). Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour).

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate.

This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again."
Assassin,4.48,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color sottu with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some alcing. Aroma of woody bourbon notes with some light vanilla and residual sugar notes with some black chocolate notes and roasted malt notes also quite dominant. Taste is dominated by woody bourbon notes with some dark roasted malt and black chocolate notes with some vanilla and a rather dry finish. Body is full with a nice oily texture and good carbonation with some warming alcohol notes. Nice late night sipper.
Assassin,4.77,"Very thick, has a beautiful bourbon warmth and ends with the rich and thick decadence that's expected here. This would be my favorite stout on this date but we always seem to find something we like better."
Assassin,4.5,2021. Excellent
Assassin,4.33,"Man, not a letdown, but… This is not Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven - nor is it that wiener kid that couldn’t see - but this one does not slay the dragon. It’s rich in flavor, but the feel is a lil light, and it has a oil oil slickness in the end.

Raul is sad."

Assassin,4.92,"smells like a 2012 stout recipe. a tad perfume-y. reminds me of the Eclipse series.... really well done. sometimes it's hard to realize something that comes close to flawless unless we have the accompanying hype, but this is very good. also makes we want to go back and find those Eclipse bottles...."
Assassin,5,"OMG. Have this at the same time as I had KBBS- to be frank & honest about it, it was so good that it felt unfair to even think about rating with any lower then the mentioned merit in life. I had the coconut version and it was amazing! Thick, full and beautifully balanced sweet. Would love to have it again... And again"
Assassin,4.29,"I was lucky enough to win the recent Assassin vertical random draw. Drove to Iowa on Friday, pick up day was Saturday.

Smell: Bourbon, Chocolate, slight Vanilla.
Taste: No adjuncts, pure BA Imperial Stout. Picking up some Vanilla on the back end.
Feel: Thinner than I expected but still nice.
Overall: Maybe the hype was too much. The beer is very good but I was not blown away."
Assassin,4.34,2019 (Silver Wax)
Assassin,4.77,"2018 Bottle (Orange Wax)

A really fantastic, in-your-face whiskey barrel stout. Lots of stewed fruits cut through a whiskey potency that finishes dangerously smooth. Very impressed. Had heard some possible bottle variance, but this one was holding up exceptionally well."
Darkness,5,Truly a tremendous stout. I’m enjoying the 2020 vintage. I won’t repeat the reviews that have already been posted here. They ring true.
Darkness,4.36,"Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy.
Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.
Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!"
Darkness,4.43,"2017 Vintage. Date stamped on bottle: 09/18/17, Forrest Witch label art; drank on June, 16th, 2022."
Darkness,4.42,"2020 release. Poured from undated bottle into a pint glass. It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming. Overall, Darkness is an extremely well crafted RIS and deserves its World-Class rating."
Darkness,4.22,"2019 vintage. Thanks Greg for sharing with us.

Huge roast and coffee component with dark chocolate and mild-moderate umami. Low carbonation but relatively healthy head nonetheless. Great beer."

Looks stupendous in the glass. Black as black body. Big tan head persists in excellent form throughout, impressive given the abv, leaves a sheet of lacing.

Light chocolate and dark fruit aromas.

Mouth full, finish sweet, warming, and dark fruit.

Overall, a magnificent RIS. Rivals Cigar City Marshal Zhukov."
Darkness,3.42,"Classic RIS profile -- lots of herbal hop, char, black licorice, tobacco leaf, and bittersweet chocolate. Oily and lightly velvety mouthfeel. Appearance is the high mark. Great head retention and lacing, even 15 minutes after pouring. Very expensive for the quality

Darkness,4.53,"I just had the 2018 version, the one with the Minotaur, IBU 85 (at release, maybe not now), and it was delicious.

Look: jet black with thick fluffy mocca colored head

Aroma: roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, maybe cherry

Flavor: The flavor is dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, very noticeable cherry, perhaps some dark fruits, raisins, plums, ending in a grassy and grapefruit rind like bitterness. Very flavorful. Slightly bitter, no alcohol flavor, very complex.

Body/Overall: Full body, very delicious."
Darkness,5,This is an AUESOME beer. May be the best Imperial stout I have had to date. HAD IT AGAINST 3 OTHER imperial stouts on the same day and blew them all away. My only regret is it is all gone. So far this is the only beer I have given straight 5.
Darkness,4.92,"2016 Cerebus bottling.

Opaque in the glass, nice 2 fingers of head.

Aroma of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sambuca, molasses, sweet dark fruits.

Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.

Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt.

Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon."

Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.

MOUTHFEEL
Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.

OVERALL
World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this."
Darkness,4.59,"2021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.

The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.

The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.

The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.

Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find."
Darkness,4.23,"2016 - Cerberus. Black wax.

Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.
Thick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.

Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!

Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.

Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly."
Darkness,4.54,"Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.

Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.

Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.

It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.

This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating."
Darkness,4.9,"#100, yummy!"
Darkness,4.65,"Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.

Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.

Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Overall amazing what can be done with just roasted malts none of the additives used in all the big dessert stouts now a days. One fabulous brew. Bought another bottle to bring home to share it was so good."
Darkness,4.84,"And here it is.
2019 Darkness courtesy of @BigIronH
I was tryin to sleep but took a 3 hour nap earlier and felt the Darkness calling me.

Poured out dark brown and settles like a dark night. A 1 and half inch head forms and settles into 1/4 inch light brown that does not go away.

Smell is a barrage of dark malt , dark chocolate, dark fruits and coffee. Exactly what is expected.

Taste is whats expected. Follows the nose like Tucan. Perfect blend of chocolate,coffee, caramel , fudge...pure glory in this one.

The mouthfeel is excellent. On the thick side and coats everything leaving flavor to resonate on the palate."
Darkness,4.85,Incredibly balanced for a burly 12% wonderful vanilla flavor and bourbon caramel flavors yum
Darkness,4.54,"2020 bottle.Pours into a goblet jet black with a billowing deep mocha colored head that leaves a nice full ring of froth behind as it settles very slowly.Fig and caramel aromas up front then the deep chocolate and toffee really come thru,amazing on the nose.Flavors of cherry and fig hit the palate than the deep chocolate/fudge hits with a hefty roast but not big enough to over take the dark fruits and chocolate,booze in the back end.Wow great stuff,been holding it,it lived up to the billing for me."
Darkness,4.32,"Pours jet black in color with minimal head. Taste is baker's and milk chocolate, slight barrel and char with a touch of vanilla. Heavy body, roasty, slightly sweet, low carbonation. Based off of some of the variations, I was not expecting to like this as much as I do. No frills stout that tastes like beer, not dessert, not barrel...even though they are there, but beer. Very very impressive. One of the best stouts I have had in some time."
Gumballhead,3.07,Tea and jasmine - right after some pumpkin ale.
Gumballhead,4.07,"I like the can artwork, great use of color. The taste reminds me of a pale ale mixed with a wheat ale. Moreover, on the taste I'm getting a mild mix of piney hops but nothing overwhelming my palate, orange, grapefruit, & juicy fruit gum near the finish. Cheers! A-"
Gumballhead,4.12,"On tap at Copenhagen Beer Festival 2011. Golden colour, moderate white head. Lovely piney and resinous aroma, also notes of tropical fruits. The flavour has also notes of pine and tropical fruits, very pleasant and thirstquenching."
Gumballhead,3.87,"Pale gold pour, nice white foam cap with some staying power. The nose is citrus. Tangerine and lemon citrus prevails in the taste, with a delicious white wheat punch toward the finish that brings cracker and a refreshing bite. This is a great summer go-to."

Look: Clear/transparent yellow with 2 fingers of head with good retention.

Bright, bouncy + fun - even at six months old.
What’s amazing is how old this recipe is. There are herds of beers like this now but when it launched it must’ve been a thunderbolt.
I get a hint of 3F’s rep from this.

Buy it by the case."
Gumballhead,3.86,"caveat that this is from an undated can, I don't know how old this beer is

pours a very nice looking hazy yellow amber with a tall foamy white head that laces as it slowly dissolves

the aroma is sort of a lemony citrus cracker

the taste light lemon over cracker that almost reminds me of juicy fruit gum

well rounded feel with a citrus pith aftertaste

the flavors have definitely faded. I can tell Gumballhead would be a pretty darn good beer fresh, but I have to go on what I have and that, unfortunately, is a slightly above average beer"
Gumballhead,4.01,"Trying first right out of the can cuz of impatience lol. Three Floyd's does not make it to Colorado where I'm from. This is really good though, tastes like liquid Wheaties. Definitely enjoying this one"
Gumballhead,3.88,"A: crystal clear; medium gold in color; 1 finger finely pored white head that receded to a wispy cap; light lacing;

S: apple juice;

T: sweet lemon and floral - lemon dominated toward the end; mild bitterness on the finish;

M: light to medium bodied; low to moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;

O: easy drinking;"
Gumballhead,3.51,"Pours into my tulip glass a brassy amber with a cakelike ecru head.

Scent is vaguely fruity.

Taste is fruit and spice. Apple and pear. Citrus. Tangy wheat.

An odd brew. Not an IPA. Not a typical wheat beer.

Glad I tried it but not really my style"
Gumballhead,3.98,"Look: It pours golden with brilliant clarity. It has a white head with very good head retention.

Smell: It has grapefruit and citrus flavors. There is a low grassy element to it with slight yeast and some earthly notes.

Taste: It has strong citrus flavors with grapefruit. There are doughy flavors after the initial flavor which is strong in the finish. There are some earthen flavors and lemon as well.

Feel: It has a medium body with a hoppy bitter, but not harsh finish.

Overall, it's has plenty of flavor with citrus, grapefruit and lemon being the strongest up front and dough and earth finishing it off."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.09,"This is for the 2019 release; sent to me by @colts9016 as part of NBW BIF #15
Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.
I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.35,Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head. Aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing. Taste is a mix of strong coconut notes with sweet caramelized malt notes and some chocolate notes. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. Very enjoyable if you like coconut.
Coconut B-Bomb,4.34,"Look - black thick w tan head and reading rimming and lacing
Smell - coconut chocolate a ton of barrel
Taste - toasted coconut with a ton of barrel along with chocolate and vanilla
Feel - medium full body with a light carb and creamy
Overall - really tasty warmer"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.64,"Schiuma cremosa e bel colore beige, corpo ebano con riflessi amaranto. Profumo di caffè e cioccolato, tosature di malto e cocco, vaniglia, caramello, prugna e ciliegia, lieve tabacco e bourbon. Ingresso goloso con melassa, frutta secca disidratata, cocco e vaniglia e accenno di liquirizia, successivamente le note delle tostature ed una delicata amaricatura assieme alla componente etilica placano la dolcezza. Finale dove il cocco timidamente si riaffaccia accompagnato da un rubusto ed elegante abbraccio di bourbon. Corpo medio pieno molto vellutato con bassa carbonade."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.41,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dense dark tan head that left a wide collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of chocolate and vanilla-like oak are present in the nose along with notes of toasted coconut.
T: The taste has lots of flavors of bourbon and associated vanilla along with notes of chocolate and toasted coconut. The alcohol is very well hidden from the taste.
M: It feels full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol lends some warming to the finish.
O: This beer does a very good job at blending the flavors together as no one flavor overpowers the others. It is also rather drinkable considering its strength.

Serving type: bottle"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.9,"#73, yummy!"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.39,"2017 & 2018 batches were as good as advertised.

Not a stout, but close to that with complexity .

Not coconut suntan lotion, but just enough balance.

Certainly they are best fresh, not +1 year aged."
Coconut B-Bomb,4.85,"2019 vintage
Amazing stuff.
Very dark brown with a one finger beige head quickly fading away.
Coconut is very nicely present alongside the barrel notes of vanilla and reinforcing the notes of coconuts.
It's about toffee and cocoa.
Overall it's very balanced.
The mouthfeel is not thin but not too thick either, preventing this to be a cloying beverage.
A wonderful brew"
Coconut B-Bomb,4.48,Wish it was thicker but still solid coconut Ba stout
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.69,"2019 Vintage. Consuming on 9/19/22. Dang this is good. For a 14.7%, the alcohol is almost nonexistent. I could get in trouble with this one."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,"Stouts, especially Imperial Stouts, are my favorite style, so I try them whenever I can. Even though Bourbon County changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!
Every year, my friends and I buy up as much as we can get our hands on. And if you can find it on tap, I like it even better."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.84,"This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt.

Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head.

Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here.

Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""

Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)

I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.

I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,5,"A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.

S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.

T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer.

M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,

O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.3,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout
Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.
A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5
S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5
T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5
M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5
D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.62,"The grandaddy. I've had the 2012 variant most recently on a trip to Chicago. Held up surprisingly well. Still have a 2013 bottle hanging on in the cellar that I can't wait to open. Even ""bad"" variants of the original are so solid, reliable and respectable. Excellent experience every time. Very much looking forward to the 2022 lineup and the 2019 > 2022 vertical I plan on doing at New Year's."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.7,"2019 vintage:

Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle into a snifter.

Look- Black, medium brown frothy head, visible particulate near the outside of the glass, average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.

Taste- Toffee, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, semi sweet.

Feel- Full body, slightly below average carbonation, mouth coating, mouth warming, smooth, creamy.

Overall- Vibrant and well balanced flavors with a full body that coats and warms the mouth. This provided a brilliant drinking experience."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.9,I drank the 2017 bottling yesterday. It was amazing! The 5 years of aging smoothed out the taste perfectly.
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.92,"Very first time that I've ever had something like this. The bottle I have is from the 2019 stock.

Poured into a chalice-like glass. Color is a very dark blackish and brown mix. Thick and syrup-like with a noticeable alcohol aroma.

Smell is excellent and to me consists of chocolate, plum, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and of course, Bourbon.

The 14.7 ABV brings a nice, warm taste to the experience and I look forward to my next bottle.

Oh yeah, enjoy it with your friends or the family members and they will thank you for the chance to taste a great stout. I highly recommend this to everyone."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.82,Bought a flight of years from craft cellar. Astounding!
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.95,This is a great beer and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. At 14.6% its very smooth and makes for a great special occasion beer. The only even slightly negative thing i could say about it is that it may be a slight bit too thick to drink at any time. If i was full i dont know that id enjoy one. In my opinion this beer is so good that i think people are now talking bad about it just to go against the grain and feel like they better than everyone else who likes it.
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.38,"Not much of a head. Very rich on the nose; bourbon, figs, cola, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine.
I understand why it’s a classic. This beer has some kick, but does so without becoming cloying or unbalanced. Not my favorite, but great nonetheless."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,2.22,"It's obviously a good stout, but it's just too much for me. Very syrupy, very sweet. You get vivid notes of chocolate and bourbon and toffee yet none of it is enjoyable. It simply has none of what I look for in a beer, or even a stout."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.69,"Awesome beer in every way. A true favorite.

L: Dark! Dark and thick as motor oil. Even the short head is caramel in color. It is beautiful!
S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly.
T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced.
F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully.
O: I love this beer. I scored it shy of perfect because I want there to be even more of everything I described. But maybe leaving me wanting more is what makes this beer so amazing."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.8,"Exceptional.

Have had a few bottles, different vintages. Does not disappoint. Definitely a top beer for any special occasion.

The pour was ordinary, no great head.
Nice aroma.
Delicious to drink. Truly outstanding. Flavors come through, but not too much. Smooth and silky. It is on the sweet side, but not quite overbearing, which makes it stand out.

ABV truly hidden.

World Class."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.63,"L - 2021 vintage. Shared half of a 16.9 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours opaque black with a 1 finger light tan head. Has significant lacing as well as alcohol legs from the 14% high ABV.

S - Sweet up front. Vanilla. Cola and chocolate. Alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisin or cherry. Some bread scents in the back.

T - Sweet taste as follows scent. Lots of dark fruit (prune, date, raisin) up front. Almost the taste of a port wine. Caramel and vanilla in there. A slight wood or oak. Chocolate notes as well. Love the complexity of each taste providing a little bit different each time. Not boozy even after is warms up some further along like other high ABV beers.

F - Really good medium body mouthfeel. Lower carbonation from and aged Beer. Very smooth and drinkable at high ABV

O - This is a great beer. I know there are a lot of ""flavors"" in this line now, but I tried the base beer of the 2021 batch, and it was World-Class. Well worth picking up and adding to the annual rotation."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.84,"2019 vintage, fantastic expression of the style. Smooth, nice punch of vanilla, with a cacao nibs forward finish."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.36,"Delicious stout filled with oak influenced flavors. The one had the pleasure of consuming was from 2015, and the bourbon flavors have softened a little, doesn't seem as forward with the alcohol, just well married into the vanilla and oak flavors. Very soft mouthfeel."
Bourbon County Brand Stout,4.32,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!

Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.

The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else.

This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me.

Still, very good."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.25,"11.2oz bottle production date 2.026 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours medium brown in color with chestnut highlights and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and a few scattered bubbles. A few tiny spots of lacing. The aroma is red wine vinegar, subtle sweetness and a hint of malt. The taste is sour red wine blending into a little brown sugar and malt with a notable red berry finish. Negligible bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, good, I guess. This is the outer limit of how much sour I can handle before I drain pour..."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,2.82,Red wine vinegar - not very sour.
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.39,"Really good sour beer that I finally got to try. The appearance isn’t so pretty, just a murky hazelnut brown color with no head. But tastes great, like sour cherries and yeasty funk, grape, a hint of oak barrel. Enjoyably sour but not overly so. Overall pretty good."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.28,"Dark brown and murky in complexion. No discernable head. The aroma is of horse blanket, barnyard funk, and tart cherries. I'm tasting tart cherries and the mouthfeel is very smooth from the oak. The mouth is also dry and crisp."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.35,"Translucent deep brownish-red, with light, quickly-dissipating tan head.

Smell? Think red wine vinegar, softened by (dried, then moistened) cherry, oak and a touch of vanilla. I say ""vinegar"", but it's softer, more rounded than that, and not as strong. A partner of the other elements, not dominating them.

Taste is is dried cherry, a touch of raisin, the aforementioned red wine vinegar, some oak tannin, and a hint of booze-soaked vanilla.

Feel is smooth/slick - it looks at ""lightly syrupy"", but doesn't actually go there - , light-medium, with light, very,very,very fine carbonation tingle. Some acetic mucilaginous feel at the back of the palate, eventually with a slight drying effect in the front.

Overall, just wonderful. I've had this before, but not in a long, long time. I need to not wait so long for the next time. It lives up to billing, and deserves its high ranking. :)"
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.24,"Poured from the 11.2 oz bottle into the test glass.
A - A ruddy, brown color, very little cap, very fine carbonation accumulates as a ring along the glass walls
S - Dark cherries, vanilla tannin, oak, some sweet malts, aged balsamic, and green apple skins.
T - Dark stone fruit, some ever so slight vanilla, a bit of late harvest grape, as the offering warms, the earthy elements pop. Grainy malts, with earthy musty threads. This is very complex
M - Medium body, semi sweet, then a shift towars slightly sour. Texture is luxurious, slick with a slightly tart linger.
Very cordial like with the gentle carbonation.
O - A bit of a revelation in 11.2 oz's. Outstanding texture, Softened by oak, the acididty doesn't run wild. The tannin touch is deft. Overall exceptional"
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.49,"More brown than red, slightly hazy, one finger of khaki head. The smell and taste are extremely complex, dominated by fruit, red wine tannins, and vinegar, but in a good way. The flavour of this stuff sure packs a wallop. It finishes with the dominant sourness only slightly mellowed out by sweetness. Overall, a wonderfully complex beer."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.43,"Excellent brownish-red body with lots of lively carbonation; thick, spongy head. A beautiful aroma of cherry and raspberry; earthy mustiness. The taste flows along with the smell; rich, fruity tartness; raw oak; moderate sourness. Heavy body; velvety residual sugar note; moderate tartness; fairly sweet overall.

This is a fantastically rich and inviting Flanders red ale. It brings all the hallmarks of the beer style to the front. I don't find it overly sour nor over-carbonated and fizzy like some I've experienced. This one is heavy with complexity and nuance.

Poured at 45 F; bottling date (I guessing): September 08th, 2020 (label had JD 0.252 13 17:47)"
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.22,"Visual: scarce coarse ocher colored foam, dark brown beer with amber reflections, veiled.
Nose: high intensity with fruity, acidulous, grape, light caramel and malt descriptors.
Taste: very intense with acidic, sour descriptors and sweet finish. Ripe grapes and ripe cherries, caramel. Acidic aftertaste of grapes always fighting with a very elegant fined sweetness. Mouth sensation of astringency and pungent carbonation with medium and soft."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.35,"330 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. There is clear bottling information, but I'm nowhere near smart enough to decipher the code.

S---You can smell the sourness. Strong fruitiness. Tart cherries.

T---Wow, this is really good. Sour cherries, light red wine vinegar.

F---Much fuller bodied than expected from a relatively light 6.0% ABV.

O---This earns its world class status. So glad I bought two."

Taste is vinous. Malty and mildly sour up front. A very long sweetish aftertaste. Some oak and leather present. Well melded.

Very smooth for a Flemish Red. Medium to light body and carbonation.

Overall a world class Flemish red. Well balanced and refreshing. Mildly sour, fruity and funky."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.18,"Rodenbach Grand Cru is clear and a deep red color, with leathery highlights. Head is dense, packed, cream colored, and lasting.
On the nose, Rodenbach is tart and fruity up front, smelling pleasantly of sour, ripe cherries. I can practically picture the juiciness of those cherries as they fall from the tree straight into my beer. Oak and vanilla lend support while softening the beer’s overall sourness. This may be my imagination but I could swear I find hints of leather hiding behind the aromas of oak. Unbaked bread lends itself to the flavors, helping the oak in its bid to soften those flavors of ripe fruit tartness.
On the tongue, Rodenbach is smooth and medium bodied. CO2 provides a spritzy carbonation that dances across the tongue. Soft flavors of unbaked bread give a platform for up front tartness which combines deftly with flavors of ripe fruit. Flavors give me ripe cherry as well as red grape minus the tannins. The finish has a lot going on each in its own subtle fashion. Chiefly there’s an earthy quality. Earthiness blends nicely with fruit as well as leather tinted flavors of oak. All of which combines to provide a very gentle flavor profile.
Like previous Flanders Reds, this one has some great character and great balance. Tartness and flavors of ripe fruit dominate without overpowering. Oak aging and a general bready quality help prevent this beer from being too strong in its tartness. Rather, it’s a delicious, refreshing, and greatly accessible example of the style."
Rodenbach Grand Cru,4.4,"I'll keep this brief - wonderful classic beer. It's one of those beers that I've seen on the shelf for years without trying. Now I wonder what took so long.

Over the last several months, the Flanders Red style has emerged as on of my favorites. So much flavor to be had here!"
Great,4.04,"12oz. Bottle served in a Spiegelau snifter. Vintage is probably circa 2014. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider (perhaps a hue darker). Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. Overall, a little past its prime. Not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however, still quite drinkable."
Great,4.44,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022

Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.

Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.

Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style."
Great,3.56,Canned 11/02/2020.
Great,4.6,2020 in a Can. Very hoppy for a barleywine. Toffee/bread and moderate amount of barrel
Great,4.63,"Vintage 2015. I was super excited to finally land one of these, particularly an older bottle - it has aged quite wonderfully. The pour is quite a lot darker and more opaque than I'd anticipated. The barrel and light caramel are pungent. Zero sign of oxidization. I really like this beer."
Great,4.1,"16 April 2020 - Beer #70 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Corona Day #35

I'm back, baby!

Appearance: 4 - looks like a standard barleywine, but a bit darker and redder. It was pretty clear on the pour but almost completely opaque in the glass.

Nose: 4 - smells like a barleywine on some barrel. A bit fruity. Nothing special so far.

Taste: 4 - still nothing special. It's definitely a very nice barleywine, but I'm not sure why it's so highly regarded.

Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew.

Overall: 4 - a very fine offering, but not anything I'd write home about. My wife would find it very odd to find a hand-written note about a good but not great BA barleywine.

Be safe!

Cheers!"
Great,4.46,"On tap at Toronado SD, left over from Beer Week, into a tulip.

Leather-mahogany in color, viscous complexion dampens any attempt at a head.
Nose is buttery bourbon, floral malts, burnt sugar and a good dose of oak. It’s flavors follow, with a lot more boozy warmth at the front of the sip.

Super tasty, smooth barleywine. From my understanding this was almost an accident, and it’s not quite as tasty as I remember it before Green Flash took things over, but still."
Storm King,4.05,"12 oz botle into a snifter.
Pours Midnight black, tan foam, good lacing.
Smell is deep dark cacao, dark toast malt, Cuban coffee, almost burnt malt.
Taste goes dark chocolate, rich espresso, a fine bold hop zing on the side of the tongue that’s unexpected.
Feel is medium carb, medium body, medium slick. Not syrupy at all.
Overall, this is a good little Stout with no barrel required."
Storm King,3.96,"I’m really late to the game on grading this!

L- Pitch black color.

S- Roasted dark malt. Slight smoky smell.

T- Dark chocolate almost cocoa flavor.

F- Decent mouthfeel.

O- Great unadulterated Imperial Stout!"
Storm King,4.44,"Poured this into a glass. Poured out a ritch and dark black with a hop, malt, and slight chocolatey smell. The taste was different to me, since this is my introduction to this type of beer and it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The ABV (9.1%) is apparent and the added hop flavor is just right. I like it and will be having it again, for sure."
Storm King,4.16,"Poured from a botle dated BB 10/22/22 into the test glass
A - Solid black color, excellent tan, tight knit froth, lacing with each draw.
S - Bakers chocoalte, char, a bit of espresso, pine.
T - Again with the bakers chocolate, add a hint of orange rime, and piney, coffee with flourless chocoalate cake.
M - Medium in body, start is semi sweet then rolls toward and stays on the bitter side. Finish is ashen dry.
O - A new favorite for me, assertive, edgy, and with all the pieces of an American RIS. Thankful to have this in our area."
Storm King,4,Pours dark. Tan foam. Malty aroma. Big hop body. Fades to a malty goodness. Bitter finish. Im surprised how hoppy it is. Good balance of malt and hops. This ones a classic.
Storm King,3.86,"Look: Pours like black coffee with a nice tan head with great retention. Sticky foam lace on the glass.
Taste and Smell: Strong espresso notes with a hint of chocolate. Somewhat bitter.
Feel: A full mouth oiliness going on.
Overall: Pretty good coffee imperial shout."
Storm King,4.02,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown
with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent
lacing. Nose of dark cocoa, pine touched hops, dark coffee, and moderate char.
Flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa, char, coffee, and floral as
well as pine touched hops on the rear. Nice mouth feel; medium full body, smooth,
lightly creamy, and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong
hops.

Overall, a solid brew, a touch more hops than I remember, but solid all the same!

Cheers"
Storm King,3.94,"Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King."
Storm King,3.89,"Pours an opaque deep dark black with a creamy/foamy mocha colored head. Deep roasted nuttiness,almost peanut butter scent, Taste is smoky, coffee,espresso even more. dark chocolate.Feels full bodied with enough carbonation.Finishes dank and chewy- Overall this is a stout that lets you know its a stout, An above average hop presence."
Storm King,4.37,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste.
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout."
Storm King,4.29,"L- jet black tan head with moderate lacing

S- herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop

T- strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char. Moderate to strong bitter.

T- medium body, medium carbonation.

O- well balanced very good beer. I would almost consider this a black IPA though"
Storm King,4.13,"Pours black with a nice light brown head. Not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists.

Citrus hops, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roast black coffee.

Very much similar to the nose, the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet. The coffee also really shows on the finish.

Full body, moderate to low carbonation, a hint of alcohol, nice big bitterness."
Storm King,4.1,"Pours a near black color with a small short-lived tan head and light lacing.

Smells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee. Sips are lightly bitter from start to finish.

Medium body with light carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.

This is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age."
Storm King,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Looks dark brown to black with a khaki head that falls off to a thin cap. Smell is a nice mix of dark malt, roasted coffee, cocoa and a bit of bright floral hops. Taste starts with roast malt, a bit of fruit (raspberry), hops. In the middle I get some bitterness from the hops, more fruit, and a cocoa powder flavor. Finish is hoppy, cocoa powder, and coffee. Very balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back. For some reason I always passed this one up years ago. This is a great stout and a nice change of pace from the barrel aged and super sweet stouts that dominate."
Storm King,4.29,"Very dark almost opaque, beautiful one inch that dissipated into a foam cap with lacing. Aroma of dark malts with hops. Taste is coffee, chocolate, roasted barley and finishes with pleasant hop bitterness. I have really missed this stout and the style it represents. This is definitely to savor and enjoy."
Storm King,4.12,Can’t go wrong with this brew
Storm King,4.2,"Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is excellent.

Smell: It has strong roasted aroma with citrus. There are some low expresso notes in the background.

Taste: It has strong roast and coffee flavors with citrus notes integrated in the malts. There is very low pine and a hint of floral.

Feel: It has a full body and slight alcohol warming.

Overall, although this is more like a black IPA to me, it has great flavors and finish."
Storm King,3.68,"Draught 8oz snifter at The Brass Tap here in Baltimore: More hops than I normally care for, especially in a stout"
Storm King,4.12,"Best by 10/14/22

So this is one of those classic beers that everyone in the forums talks about quite often. All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Upon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee

Oof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer. Finishes mostly dry with a huge roast character

This beer is definitely a product of the time when it was popular, and it's pretty damn good for that. Drinks easy for what it is"
Storm King,4.24,"So this stout is very interesting to me, since it uses European malts and American hops. I read some reviews about this stout that were much older, stating that it tasted more like a black IPA than a stout, but I disagree with this assessment. It tastes like a European imperial stout to me, with cocoa, slight coffee, a bit of bread, and a little bit of a hop bite, but really can't tell that the hops create any outstanding bitterness. Certainly not a thin beer, but certainly not the thickets beer I've ever had, and quite dry on the aftertaste.. I really enjoy it, but it's not as good when warm as some other thicker stouts. Overall, great stout, but better when served up slightly on the cold side. If you want something to drink at room temp, this probably isn't it."
Storm King,4.2,"l: 75% black, head is dense, off white

s: fresh toast,

t: fresh toast, a little burned, some coffee,

f: medium body, velvety, balanced, chugging friendly

overall: good quality stuff, not so much complexity as the aged ones but still taste great, and affordable"
Storm King,3.93,"Appearance:
The type of brown called to mind by an untamed forest, thick with brawny tree trunks, swallowed up in the darkness of its own, impermeable canopy; nightfall immersing it in sightless black. Oh, it has a head too… Right. Got a little carried away there. It’s a lush, wonderful head of pale, sandy froth with long-lived retention and lace that starts as a sheet, then breaks into cobwebs.

Bouquet:
Smoked oats, coated in a chocolate that’s never even heard the word “sugar,” let alone mixed with it. The backend yields dark malts and miniscule, earthy hops, pulverized into powdery dryness.

Feel:
So plush and thick, it’s like chewing on a satin quilt—but in this case, pretend the quilt is edible and chewing on it is not the result of mental derangement. A weave on low carbonation provides a bit of fiber-like contrast to the texture… Hmm, I’m not really selling you here, am I? Look, its good okay. Full bodied and smokier than a volcanic plume. Drink it and instantly gain +100 Manly Points.

Taste:
A billowing cloud of woodsmoke engulfs the palate, leaving the tongue to blindly trip over dark, earthy hops, bang its shins on blocks of raw cacao, and fall, gratefully, onto a pillow of soft oats at the end."
Storm King,4.12,"From a 12oz bottle dated best by 10/7/22 into a pint glass.

Pours an opaque black with about two and a half fingers of tan head. Great retention, great lacing.

Smells mainly of roasted/smoky malts with a hint of coffee and baker's chocolate.

Taste is bitter dark chocolate with strong roasty/smoky notes. Touch of coffee in there too.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but still pretty full-bodied. This is a different kind of IS than the RISs I'm used to. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Low to medium carbonation.

This is really a decent beer. A little different than what I'm used to but a great change of pace. Glad Victory brought this one back."
Storm King,4.92,"Perfection incarnate for me. This is exceptional - seriously. I think one of my favorite beers has to be Alchemist's Luscious. I don't get up to VT more than once (maybe twice) a year. I have a couple stowed away to enjoy this holiday season from a summer trip - I love that stuff but this is so reminiscent. Stylistically, profile, aesthetic. It's quite a surprise for me. What I'm trying to say is, this to me fills the luscious void in a sense. Price point is excellent as well. Man, what a beer. Big, bold, bitter, luscious stuff. I suspect there's something of cascade in here - that hop just becomes what you need it to. I dunno, this is wonderful stuff though. Grab it."
Storm King,4.25,"L: Jet black body with a finger of brown head.
S: aromas of coffee, espresso, hazelnut, and roasted nuts
T: big time coffee/espresso notes, followed by a nice hop finish with a touch of bitterness
F: slightly creamy, medium body
O: outstanding, underrated in my opinion"
Storm King,4.31,"pours a deep cola brown-near-black body with a tan foam head that has low retention and leaves occasional thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin murky cap with occasional thick bubbles and a thick defined halo

aroma is clear, thick and rich molasses sweetness with thin licorice herbal hop and mocha

taste is espresso with dark fruit underpinnings and that herbal licorice tinged hop; dark chocolate is kinda buried here but in there with the roasted malt; resinous pine underlying

mouthfeel is somewhat thin bodied with robust carbonation; comes across like carbonated espresso with pillowy bitter prickles throughout and a dry, hopped finish with an herbal, licorice tinged hop and robust dark chocolate and espresso aftertaste

overall:
straight up carbonated espresso beer. pretty great and somewhat complicated and tinged with resinous pine and lowkey herb. pretty great overall, but lacking balance"
Storm King,2.55,"I’m not sure how this beer gets such a high rating. Ether I’m wrong and need to study beer more to understand it or everyone else is wrong. Or I can just simply have a different opinion which is probably the case. We will go with the last one I guess. I get nothing on the nose other than a slight burnt toast scent. The taste is of burnt soap or a semi cheep cup of coffee. Mouth feel seems non existent. I think Victory can do better than this by a long shot.

After I wrote what I said above, I saw a comment below saying that it is more of a black lager and yes!!! That’s it!! The post even said if it is a black lager than it is a good black lager! This is indeed a wonderful black lager and not a stout. Shame they call it a stout. It is the hops that add too much of a bitterness for a stout without the maltiness, yet for a black lager it is perfect.

Strange how names can make all the difference."
Storm King,4.71,"Imperial stout 9.1 abv with relatively high IBU at 65. This is a style of imperial stout I really enjoy, and it shares the heritage of North Coast's venerable Old Rasputin. Glad I found this one. Bought a 6-pack of 12-Oz bottles and went back for the case. In PA this one is $40 per case of 25 or $10.49/6-pack, and an exceptional deal. Appearance: Black, tan head, good lacing. Taste: Strong coffee, caramel, malts, balanced bitterness to offset the stout sweetness and clean finish. No alcohol heat or odor, so be careful with this one. It's a seasonal favorite."
Saison Bernice,4.7,"Brief Review:

O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.

Recommendation: Definitely on par with some things I've had from HF, this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery."
Saison Bernice,4.5,One of the best saison’s I’ve ever had. Only slightly under Cellarman which just barely took the edge for me.
Saison Bernice,4.7,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.

Appearance: A clear golden colour with a two finger pillowy white head that had good retention and left some nice lacing.

Aroma: Funk, peach, apricot, musty, oak, lemon zest, with light orange vanilla and floral notes.

Taste: Light sour, tart, and funk, stone fruit, apricot, peach, citrusy notes, lemon zest, orange peel, vanilla, peppercorn, floral.

Mouthfeel: Creamy beginning, smooth, medium to light bodied, with moderate carbonation, and a dry finish.

Overall: Really smooth and enjoyable. Just so easy to drink with its great aroma and flavours. Wish it was easier for me to get more."
Saison Bernice,4.78,"Saison Bernice is just about my favorite beer of all time. Perfect in its drinkability, its tartness, the hint of funk, it hits all the right spots for me. Truly an elegant and refined beer!"
Saison Bernice,4.5,Great representation of non-fruited saison
Saison Bernice,4.52,"Big thanks to Dimidiata for this
750 ml bottle, batch 24 5/20, poured into an Ourison glass

A- A hazy copper with a three finger white head.

S- Sour, pears, lemons, wheat, floral, wheat, mild funk, a slightly sweet sap like earthiness.

T- Sour, lemons, pears, wheat, mild funk, floral, nice earthiness.

M- Smooth, soft, fluffy, light body.

O- A wonderful saison and very easy to drink. I would have liked maybe a little more funk and a little less sour. Definitely leaning hard into how some American breweries have made saisons more sour than funky, but that doesn’t take away from how good this is."
Saison Bernice,4.44,"Bottled May, 2020. Poured relatively conservatively into a standard pint glass. Attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head, a thin layer of which lingers for some time. Tons of lacing, which is unusual, at least for the saisons / farmhouse ales I typically drink. Definitely picking up the sour on the nose, although it's not overwhelming. Taste is pleasantly tart and just the tiniest bit of funk in the aftertaste. Feel is pillowy soft and smooth. Less carbonation than I expected based on the effervescence that was present upon opening the bottle. This is a very well done saison."
Zenne Y Frontera,4.77,"A: Pours crystal clear, dark golden yellow, almost amber, small fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. 4.25

S: Aroma is tart lactic acidity, a big minerality, some plastic like funk notes, only the faintest barnyard characters. Mild sherry notes give it a subtle fruitiness. A bit of spice on the finish like white pepper. 4.75

T: Taste is immediately wildly complex. There’s a sweetness up front followed by a sour tart punch, then lingering oaky vanilla on the finish that lasts forever. It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking. Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice. Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5

M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable. 4.25

O: A gem of a beer. Well worth the hype. An elite beer. 4.75"
Zenne Y Frontera,4.54,"Batch 5, Blend 49, Season 17|18, Bottled 4/11/18

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open

Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard

The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone

The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak

Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that

Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!"
Zenne Y Frontera,4.65,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass.

Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.

Blend no 94. Season 18|19. Bottling date of 25/07/19. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes. My first pour of a Zenne y Frontera."
Zenne Y Frontera,4.25,Bottle: Poured a dark golden color lambic with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of funky ester with some barnyard notes and some woody vinous notes. Taste is also a mix of vinous notes with some funky barnyard notes and oak notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Great lambic but was expecting the Pedro Ximinez barrel to be more apparent.
Zenne Y Frontera,4.48,Bottle. Generously shared by Seth. Clear light amber pour with a small white head. Mild funk aromas. Mellow caramel and oak notes give way to mellow horse blanket and barnyard backbeats. Smooth with less prickly champaign like carbonation. Very good mouthfeel and body. Simply outstanding.
Zenne Y Frontera,4.42,"Bottle @ La Palma Sour Fest 2015. Hazy orange colored beer with a small white head. Holy smokes is this funky. Tons of musty, damp, earthy basement and mushroom notes. Bright lemon and green grape acidity. Slight apricot sweetness and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Really nice mineral quality to it as well. Pretty citrusy and zesty as well. A winner, as usual."
Goose IPA,3.39,"16 ounce draught pull in a chilled mug at Shrimp Shack in Ft. Myers, FL.
Arrived filled to the tip top, zero head, unremarkable smell, tastes common, maybe sub-common.
Feels like a thin food rinse, which worked out fine in pushing a shrimp po’ boy down.
Overall, a solid “meh”."
Goose IPA,3.43,Rank and disgusting IPA.
Goose IPA,3.96,Good beer. Got it on sale lol
Goose IPA,3.75,"Drank at MozzaBella, Bologna on vacations so no notes on this one."
Goose IPA,3.53,Straw colored with a moderate head that settles nicely. Aroma is floral with a bit of citrus. Taste is reasonably typical IPA with a good amount of grapefruit with some breadiness and a moderate finish. A solid but not remarkable IPA.
Goose IPA,3.84,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

S: Grassy, resinous, floral, a little citrus, earthy herbal notes, biscuity bready malt, and a pretty dry finish.

T: Citrus, lemon and grapefruit, floral, resinous pine, subtle fruity notes, apricot and peach, grassy earthy notes, biscuity bready malt, and a dry finish.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: The first few sips feel more like a lightened up classic American IPA with all the pithy citrus presence, but as it warms up the English side really comes out. Nothing overly exciting, but credit where it's due, it's actually pretty nicely balanced and rather drinkable. Probably never gonna be my first choice, but there are worse options to have around."
Goose IPA,3.44,"L- Good tall light tan head and transparent light copper beer.
S - Bitter grapefruit pith, some resin notes
T- Strongly bitter with grapefruit pith and pine resin notes. Little bit of floral sweetness and light malt do not help tamp down the bitterness for me.
M- Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation and drying bitters.
O- Strong hop bitterness put this out of my favorite zone."
Goose IPA,3.48,"Poured from a 12oz can
Unsure if this is the right place to review as this is just called IPA not Goose IPA but maybe it's just newer AB branding.

On the pour it's a pretty good looking beer with a decent sized rocky head and some nice lacing. Crystal clear straw color with no haze.

Smell is carrying some grapefruit and tropical notes with a fruity sweetness. I cant pick much else up with this sickness, my nose isnt quite functioning.

The taste is bold with bittering hops right in your face and a nice trickle of fruity flavors following behind it. Maybe a tad bit of malt backing it up, but nothing crazy, just firm pale malts standing in the back.

The feel on the other hand suggests more malts than I'm tasting the head comes back to life as you drink especially in large amounts slowing you down. But it does feel relatively seasonable other than that not too heavy on the stomach.

Overall a standard every day ipa for those that love ipas it isnt shy about the hops and the malts are firm enough to keep it steady. No off flavors and seems good enough quality wise. Not a huge IPA guy myself."
Goose IPA,3.58,"Pours a clear bright yellow, pillowy white head leave a nicely laced glass. Nose gets some piney hops, some cracker and caramel. Taste is citrus and a bit of sweetness. Medium bodied, nice carbonation. Not bad."
Goose IPA,3.48,"12oz can poured into a snifter

A- pours a clear golden yellow with a one finger head that has shirt retention

S- floral and earthy hops with undertones of biscuit, caramel and honey

T- floral hop bitterness up front is countered by some caramel maltiness. Mid-palate brings out some biscuit and a hint of citrus. The finish falls off, leaving only a hint of floral and citrus hop bitterness

M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish"
Goose IPA,3.75,"Poured from a bottle, ""Drink by 10 Oct 21"", but I got it from a neighbor who was not storing it cool and not sure how long...
Anyways, it's a classic. I haven't had this in years so won't debate how it holds up against its former 'independent' self, and I don't care. It's a fine IPA, clear amber-yellow and classically bitter and malt-balanced, straight up citrus/pine hops and a dry hoppy finish.

I wouldn't have picked it up in a store, but happy to drink these from a friend."
Goose IPA,3.6,Not bad. This is an English IPA? Not really
Double Bastard Ale,4.31,Strong biting ale. Light copper color. Thin smooth consistency. A better big brother to the regular arrogant B*@tard ale.
Double Bastard Ale,3.85,"This stuff is rugged. Not my favorite style, but apparently a good representation of it. Just too much hop bite and burn for me to truly enjoy. Definitely a fun time trying it out though!"
Double Bastard Ale,4.2,"this is a good one. taste like a big hoppy loaf of raisin bread, in the best way. big and beautiful and surprisingly clean. I could drink this one all night, until I pass out"
Double Bastard Ale,4.21,"2016 vintage

Here we go, beer number 666. And a 101oz bottle at that. I paid over $100 for this but I think it’s gonna be worth it splitting this thing with my boy. Let’s unlock the mini padlock and pop this baby open!

Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast

Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt

A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness

It's not the best beer in the world, but I'm still happy to have gotten this big bottle. I'll have to see how I feel after finishing the big ass bottle"
Double Bastard Ale,3.75,"650 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11%. Hazy reddish brown colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of American hops, piney notes, also caramelized orange marmalade, some alcohol. Very hoppy flavour, medium sweet, caramel and alcohol. Bitter finish, hints of solvent.Warming mouthfeel. There’s plenty of hops in this one (surprise, surprise), but this is probably not where you go when you look for balance."
Double Bastard Ale,4.75,"65 cl. bottle, bought at The Situation some years ago. Served at home in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy brown colour, small head with short retention. No lacing.
Boozy aroma, caramel, dried fruits,licorice, molasses, hops, pine, some citrus.
Medium to full body, creamy texture, no carbonation. Dry sweet and hoppy finish,
Taste of caramel, licorice, molasses, chocolate, hops, citrus.
A beast of a beer."
Double Bastard Ale,4.07,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, bottled on 15th October 2015. Poured into a snifter glass.

Appearance: A cloudy murky rusty orange brown colour with a thin orangey beige head that disappeared quickly while leaving some nice spotty lacing.

Aroma: Sweet malt, citrusy orange peel, citrus pith, caramel, orange hard candy, bourbon and dark dried fruit like raisins.

Taste: Sweet malt, caramel, toffee, light bitterness, grapefruit peel, citrus pith, dried dark fruit, bourbon, piney hops and some light spice.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with soft carbonation and a touch boozy.

Overall: A good balance between sweet, bitter and spice. While not overly boozy, it is a sipper, and a nice one at that."
Double Bastard Ale,4.24,"2004 release purchased at Stone’s Liberty Station facility back in 2016; I figured its time.

L: copper-sepia hue with nary a bubble to be seen. Looks like a glass of iced tea.

S: plenty of booze evident at first whiff but upon a second and third visit, I can sniff out some prune/raisin and a bit of a hop bite. Resembles a Scotch Ale or dubbel.

T: this beer delivers as advertised; a heavy-hitting hop bomb cloaked in a ton of malt. The aging effect is evident as there is plenty of sugar on each sip. The prune-raisin combo is omnipresent and increasingly dominant with each sip.

F: this is a mildly viscous, smooth beer. Virtually no alcohol burn and minimal carbonation. Goes down relatively easy for a 10% ABV.

O: worthy of the wait and neat to be able to drink a 15-year old brew that was intentionally set aside for future consumption by a world class brewery."
Double Bastard Ale,4.31,"22oz bottle. 2011 dated release.
Cloudy, medium amber colored body. Pinky finger width of off white, creamy head. Leaves extensive patterns of lacing.
Aroma of caramel malts and bourbon barrel.
Taste is heavy with hops, along with the caramel malts. The bourbon barrel is there but not too prominent. Big piney hops.
More than medium mouth feel. Very good carbonation.
Some chunks come from the tail end of the bottle. Very powerful combination of the heavy hops and the caramel malts, together with the barrel treatment. Close to a lava lamp show with the descending and ascending chunks. Beautiful body color and tight, long lasting head."
Double Bastard Ale,2.06,"I could tolerate the single (like a double), but this is so cloyingly boozy and abrasive even after eighteen months bottle aging, I don’t know if there’s anything good in there worth aging longer to find."
Double Bastard Ale,4.23,"A: The beer is coppery amber in color. Light tan carbonation that retains around the rim with no lacing.
S: Strong barley malt aroma is awesome. Sweet caramel and alcohol notes with a touch of hops.
T: tastes like a malt bomb explosion of high alcohol sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar up front. Then the self-proclaimed unreasonable amount of hops pokes through. Noticeable alcohol warming and vodka-like aftertaste. Moderate bitterness and hops balance out the sweetness making this a well-balanced, if unusual concoction.
M: Body is fairly light and syrupy, like a day old coke.
O: I think this beer is awesome. That being said, I like aggressive, in your face flavors. Your mom will hate this beer. But isn’t that a reason to try it?"
Hopslam Ale,4.71,"This was a New To Me beer and I was just blown away by how much I love it. Great look, smell, and taste. If you like DIPAs, you'll really like this. Enjoy!!"
Hopslam Ale,4.85,"Hopslam (2022) has a very thick, off-white head and a translucent, orange appearance, with bubble streams and heavy lacing. The aroma is of white bread crust. The flavor is of strong, but not harsh, hop bitterness, white bread crust, and possible honey. Hopslam (2022) has a high-medium body and a dry finish.

RJT"
Hopslam Ale,4.79,"Impressive smoothness for the ABV, world class indeed!"
Hopslam Ale,4.49,"Don’t need a lot of detail for this monster.,. it’s just totally superb across the board.
Excellence in brewing. Killer DIPA.
And I dig the Danger Factor.,. “go ahead.,. have another.,” lol."
Hopslam Ale,4.6,"L - golden with a large off-white head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing. Good looking IPA
S - Tons of juicy, piney, bitter hops, tropical and citrus notes, as well as honey. Some caramel and malts as well. Floral notes as well
T - follows the nose with juicy, piney, resinous, bitter hops, tropical and citrus fruits, and honey all intermixed incredibly well. The honey really smooths out bitterness from the hops. Malt ties everything together nicely
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Refreshing
O - an incredibly well balanced DIPA"
Hopslam Ale,4.47,"Canned 1-20-22
Perfect, beauteous pour. Deep amber color, transparent with reasonable chill haze and a firm, persistent 1/2 inch head of creamy tan foam that left full curtains of lace.
Aroma is a mix of rich malt and hints of woodsy hops. Sweet, caramel and honey nose with subtle pine and citrus hop notes are a welcoming indicator of the flavors to follow.
Rich and yummy malt flavors wrap around the conifer and leathery hop resins in terrific balance. Honey character comes through and the body leans towards a honey like texture and mouth feel. Okay, Not honey thick but your do feel the beer hug your tongue, leaving a slick, sweet coating allowing that depth of flavor to linger.... honey-like.
Hop bitterness comes in at the finish with a long and smoldering hop/pepper burn as the honey-malt dance twirls off stage.
Alcohol is always perceptible but never gets in the way or in any way harsh.
Expertly crafted, no un-needed wheat or oat starch, no unseemly and superfluous floculants, just a straight up damn good BIG beer.
Outstanding."
Hopslam Ale,4.75,"It smells really floral, citrussy and sweet. There's a subtly about the scents. Definitely the sweetness is from both the malts and honey. The citrussy floral notes are obviously from the slamming hops.

Sweetness is the first taste that occurs as it hits the palet but then really nice hoppy bitterness.

It's thin and has medium foamy carbonation. The finish is bitter, floral and sweet initially incredibly balanced but everything else fades and the bitterness remains drawing out for some time.

Overall it's such an extremely good DIPA. The hops are very strong but the sweetness of the malts and honey balance it out so instead of being extreme it's incredibly refreshing. One of my favorite DIPAs, it has an originality to it. I give it a 5.7 out of 6."
Hopslam Ale,4.39,"look: deep yellow, white head,

smell: very nice, floral and plum smell

taste: honey and floral and grapefruit peel, very punchy

feel: medium-full body, dense and smooth, balance, no boozy at all

overall: awesome beer, it's similar to triple sunshine and zombie dust, in my opinion"
Hopslam Ale,4.37,"nice off white head but I expected it to be longer lasting for beer rated this highly. nice lacing. Less smell than I expected, but it just oozes ""complexity"". Less hop bitterness than I expected/more malty than I expected. .Medium to heavy body mouthfeel; very smooth, merest hint of the honey. Overall, not a lick of indication that it is 10% ABV. A very nice double IPA but not entirely sure it is at or anywhere near the top of my cost v. quality list for IPAs."
Hopslam Ale,4.53,"Decided to delete my old review so that this one shows as new ... copied the original text below for reference. Best beer I've had this year, don't know what's changed but been thru an entire case now ... amazing. Not Heady Topper, but I recommend drink from the can, or pour into a big glass and enjoy the ride. Looks good, smells fresh but the taste is the wow factor, Extremely hopped, with a great bitterness, drinkable, and 2 16's is completely satisfying, overall world class.

Edit 1/31/2021 This year's release back in bottles is very good, almost great, and I actually bought a sixer after my one single for the first time in many years. For me to spend $20 on a sixer, it has to be outstanding. Real bitterness. 4.25

Original 1/31/2020 Easily the most overrated beer on earth. And, yes, I still get one (some years even 2, a long time ago an actual sixer) every year thinking I will change my opinion. That's stupid, because I never do. Very mediocre and actually boring, even smelled a little bit like poop poured into my mason jar. Thank goodness, the aroma quickly cleared. Pretty golden color I guess. Smells decently of malt and hops, I don't detect the honey at all. Taste follows, fresh but way too mild. Overall boring as hell."
Hopslam Ale,4.5,Been drinking and loving Hopslam for years. This year the honey smell and taste was less than previous years but still found it to be an outstanding beer and one almost all beer lovers will enjoy.
Hopslam Ale,4.33,Wonderfully balanced double. Just amazing flavor.
Hopslam Ale,4.63,"2/11/22 On draft at the Lincoln Fill Station.
LOOK: Very clear amber with an off white head, with good retention and better side glass lace.
SMELL: As advertised, floral and pine hops, honey, also some dark fruit.
TASTE: Citrus, not sharply bitter, smooth, malts are heavy and there is a combination of early malt and honey sweetness
in addition to the resinous hops.
Chewy, hides the 10% ABV well mildly sour in the aftertaste.
EDIT: 4/29/22
Had a can of Hopslam while in Laurel. Delicious!
Excellent, Seemed to be even better than the draft. Changed overall from 4.45."
Hopslam Ale,4.43,"16 ounce can poured into a 22 ounce Applebees style glass. Canned 1/13/22, so super fresh.

L---Clear dark gold/amber color with an airy off-white head that had very good retention and left great lacing. This is what other beers are trying to look like.

S---Floral, very floral. Sweet, like honey.

T---Grapefruit, as advertised. Finishes with the honey. Hoppy & a bit bitter. Alcohol is well hidden. On a warm day, that could be a problem.

F---Medium/full body with more carbonation than expected for the high ABV.

O---I was excited to get one of these and I was not disappointed. This is a great beer from a great brewery."
Hopslam Ale,4.29,"Can into pint glass.

L: Pours a light copper, a little hazy, with a head at first full, dissipating quickly but leaving a persistent small remnant behind. Good lacing.
S: Definitely full of hops. Mostly floral but a little piney too, if you wait for it.
T: For me the honey hits first, but then there's really good balance between all the different hop varieties, with a really nice bitterness to finish things out.
F: Soft and pillowy but also full-bodied and well-rounded. My favorite part about this beer.
O: An all-timer. Sits up there with Nugget Nectar as one of the highlights of a Pennsylvania winter."
Hopslam Ale,4.43,"Pours a bright copper with a full head that slowly dissipates.

A broad array of floral and pine hop notes on the nose. The honey, had I not known was there would have been too negligible to notice, but, knowing it is there, my nose picks up a smidgen.

Classically piney/grassy IPA on the tongue with a solid bitterness to finish the sip. The honey shines without adding any unwanted sweetness. Quite good.

Lightly effervescent with a full body.

This is excellent stuff. I’m thrilled to have finally tried a can and would definitely buy it in large numbers were I afforded the opportunity."
Hopslam Ale,3.86,"Not as intense as I expected. Smell is kind of muffled. The thing I like eat about it is the feel: smooth and a little syrupy going down, with some alcohol warmth after. The bitterness and sweetness are well balanced. Good sipping beer. I'll finish this four pack with pleasure, but I probably wouldn't seek it out in the future."
Blushing Monk,3.78,"Pours a clear light pink color Smell has raspberry ,vanilla yeast and vanilla . Taste flows nose with raspberry front , followed by melon ,vanilla and stone fruits . . Mouth feel sweet with some yeast funk, slight tartness ."
Blushing Monk,4.37,"It’s clear and the color of pink grapefruit. The raspberry smell is very evident and pleasant. Taste more like a cider than a beer. The raspberry comes through strong and at first it’s sweetness is immediately up front but followed by a sour on the finish. Gives the flavor a beautiful experience. Make sure you coat your entire tongue, this hits so many different taste buds. Nice!"
Blushing Monk,4.17,"Pours rose' with a 1"" light pink head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is floral, raspberry. Belgian yeast.

Taste is wine like. Raspberries, Belgian yeast, sweet.

Medium body, lively carbonation. Sweet finish.

An interesting take on a beer."
Blushing Monk,4.39,"Bottled on 11/23/2020, drank on 5/3/2022, so may need to revisit this when I try a fresh one. But for those of you curious about how it held up, read on-
Poured reddish amber, deeply hued, and sported a manila colored 1 cm head for a minute or two, leaving behind a thin ring which left regular lacing.
The aroma is still all about the raspberries. But there is a secondary note in there that reminds me, of all things, angel food cake. Hmmmm.
The flavor starts out strong with raspberry but later mellows to a semi sweet malty ale that is sheer pleasure to drink. The angel food cake shows up in the flavor as well, very curious and very tasty.
The feel took me back a bit, far more viscous than expected, but that's likely on me. This is a fruited ""Strong"" Belgian ale and a little viscosity isn't misplaced. Just unexpected. Maybe fresh the carbonation balances it out more.
OA, so glad the released this again, sorry I picked an old one to rate it with, but once it's open, ya drink it!"
Blushing Monk,5,Absolutely love it hopefully it turns into a year round production!
Blushing Monk,3.66,"This is a very very berry beer—appearance, sip, scent all scream berry bomb. Enjoyed on tap at the source, after trying it in the wild for a number of years."
Blushing Monk,4.12,"Very red in color

Plenty of raspberries in the nose.

Raspberry with a bit of yeast and tartness

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Pretty similar to NG Raspberry Tart in my recollection. Nice change of pace, but nothing you can drink a gallon of."
Blushing Monk,4.15,"Pour is a beautiful deep ruby red - obviously tons of raspberries. thick pink head. Decent retention and lacing.
Nose is fresh, sweet, ripe raspberries, cherry. subtle estery yeast character
taste is fresh, ripe raspberries upfront followed by ester / clove from the yeast. quickly replaced by sweet cherries. Not overly sweet at all. lightly tart."
Blushing Monk,4.42,"Look is ruby red that almost glows. Head is minimal, but leaves a beautiful sparkling rim on glass when moved. Smell is cherry pie with a nice earthy undertone. It’s very gentle on the nose, but still present. The taste isn’t as gentle- and that’s okay. Ripe syrupy raspberry and cherries upfront, becoming tart raspberry filling with floral notes. The finish is sweeter than the start. Feel is deliciously creamy. This beer is fantastically balanced between sweet and tart. It’s like a cherry pie and raspberry jam love child. A true treat."
Blushing Monk,4.16,"Glowing red with very little head, leaving a thin ring. Aroma is all raspberries, and wonderful. It's not the most complex nose, but it smells amazing. Taste is also all raspberry. A little on the sweet side, but man is it good. Relatively low carb. Alcohol is completely hidden. Really tasty beer."
Blushing Monk,3.91,"750 ml bottle, as Founders Blushing Monk 2015, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.2%. Beautiful clear red colour, moderate pinkish-white head. Lovely and intense aroma of ripe raspberries and raspberry candy. Sweet flavour (too sweet for some, I’m sure - but not for me), raspberries and raspberry candy galore, some tart hints and very moderate bittering hops the finish. The alcohol is well hidden, dangerously drinkable. A fine dessert beer. I was about to write ""the big bottle is for sharing"", but then I noticed it was empty - and I’m here alone. Oh well ...."
Blushing Monk,3.98,"My first in filling-out my reviews of the Beers of Fame; prompted by Todd's thread. (Blushing Monk marks my 163rd of 250. Incidentally, I claim to have Bragging Rights within the Medicare Crowd... and if I'm wrong, let me know and the race is on.)

As for this Monk... reminds me of a strong version of New Glarus' Raspberry Tart. (And I'm reminded I haven't had that for a few years now and need a beer run to Wisconsin.)

Monk Looks pretty good in a flute; a pretty ruby, some foam and enough bubbles. Smells like raspberry's with some alcohol and a few hops for balance. Tastes are largely the same, although in the late palate the alcohol lets itself be known. Cleansing and bubbly on the tongue, a light to medium mouth. I like how Founders made fruity drinks an area of concentration relatively early when their cash cows are strong stouts. Shows diverse interests and traditions. But, I wonder if others think that Monk is just an amped up Rubaeus. Think I'll read a few reviews."
Blushing Monk,3.82,"L: Crystal clear ruby red with a tall head that dissipates leaving some lacing.

S: Overwhelmingly raspberry, but some phenolic yeast and breadiness as well.

T: Very sweet raspberry flavor, some mild bready notes. Very low bitterness.

F: Full bodied, a tad syrupy, but not that bad.

Overall: A very tasty beer that is huge on the raspberries. Any raspberry fans would really like this, otherwise it is probably best to not buy too much. Very good."
Aurelian Lure,4.39,"Hazed golden straw with a finger-and-a-half of near-white foam head with tightly knit bubbles. Some modest, sloppy lacing clings to the sides of the glass before sliding back down into the crown and wisp.

Refined barnyard aroma with hints of hay, lemon and apricot fruit roll-ups.

Delightful taste of super-juicy dried apricot layered over a slightly sour, slightly funky barnyard-and-lemon base. There’s maybe a little white wine. Maybe a little oak. The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected. Really superb.

Soft, mildly creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation.

One of the juiciest, softest-feeling sours I’ve had the pleasure of drinking. The acidity really isn’t over the top at all. I love this."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.9,"#132, yummy!"
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.46,"5/14/22 Canned 4/18/22 DC. Soft, creamy, pillowy. Citrus forward with strong wheat, oats influence. No pine or bitterness at all. High quality but not a fav for reasons of style."
Double Dry Hopped Double Citra Daydream,4.59,"Every bit as good as the Mosaic of the same style/treatment. Maybe even a touch better for my palate.

Tons of soft citrus and pineapple. Fluffy little touches of grass."
Honker's Ale,3.71,"The first beer of my trip to Chicago for Riot Fest! Honkers is one of those beers always spoken fondly of by old school BAs, and I figure there’s no better way to start off the trip than with this beer I don’t see in Massachusetts. Let’s dive in

Pours a cloudy deep orange amber with 2 fingers of light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

It doesn’t have all that much presence in the nose, but what’s there is pretty good. I’m picking up on aromas of biscuity malt, floral hops, lemon zest, honey, and light pepper

It’s a bit more expressive in taste, but still not a punch in the face or anything. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, crackery malt, honey, orange zest, and green tea. The swallow brings notes of black tea, floral hops, biscuity malt, honey, toasted grain, and light orange

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry but a bit watery

This is nothing amazing, but I wasn’t expecting anything amazing. This is a mediocre example of an old school style from a bygone era. That being said, it’s still a really enjoyable beer to drink despite its flaws"

Honker's Ale,3.59,"The first ESB I ever tried, and I thought I hated the style until I tried Fuller’s ESB, which is really great. Turns out the problem isn’t the style, it is that this is a mediocre tasting ale at best."
Honker's Ale,3.84,"On draft at Goose Island Clybourn 1/15/21

Reddish amber hues with thin white head. Dark malt and and some dark fruits on the nose. Sweet malt, breadiness, hint of fruits, and mildy bitter taste. It's fairly light and easy on the palate. This was my first Goose Island beer and I will always come back to it. It's a great sessionable ESB."
Honker's Ale,3.77,"Was once one of my ""go-to"" options in the days of independent Goose Island; this was my standard bearer for ESBs for some time. The post AB-InBev offering isn't as appealing; the most recent offerings seem to lack the maltiness and body I enjoyed previously. The scores above reflect an average of pre/post acquisition."
Honker's Ale,3.69,"Pours a red copper color with a khaki head , Smell and taste was dark fruits,toffee and caramel,baked bread malts . Had medium carbonation with a thickness coating and bitterness.."
Honker's Ale,3.64,"Pours amber with a half inch white head that left nice lacing. Smells of roasted malts, caramel, yeast and hops. Tastes of bready malts, caramel, burnt sugar, yeast and a nice balancing hop presence. Light bodied, well carbonated, watery mouth feel."
Honker's Ale,2.64,"L- Seems to be a slightly reddish amber, clear. Pours with 3mm white head, clears quite swiftly.
S- Light roast smell, and there could be a hint of fruit in it too.
T- Somewhat dry on the front, though more of that comes over as rather dryly carbonic, ie from high carbonation, instead of notable hopping. Otherwise the flavour is say like a lager + a bit more sweetness + a touch more body.
F- There's something rather synthetic about it, and I can't put my finger on it...
O- ... I can finish it but I shan't put this on my list to buy again.
p.s. The lable states that the brew is styled on English Bitter, really!
330ml bottle"
Honker's Ale,3.62,"From notes 3/31/13: Pours clear medium amber producing 2+ fingers of frothy, off-white, somewhat lasting head that leaves abundant webs of lace. Aroma is toasted malt, sugary caramel, yeast and a burnt hint with a thin hop character. Taste is malty toast with a hint of char, caramel, toffee, some chocolate, cream and yeast backed by a hoppy bitterness. Average at best, To tell the truth I'm a little disappointed based on what I have come to expect from this brewery. Taste more like a bitter Amber Ale than an English Bitter."
Honker's Ale,4.06,"It's funny that the best English Bitter that I had is made by an American brewery.
As it has much morecontent, aromaand flavor than the English counterparts, I vote this the best I've ever had.
Along with the typical/trademark English Bitter light/watery body, it has enough malts and most importantly, fragrant hops that stand out in the aroma. The taste is also quite well balanced, does not get too light nor too dry bitter so I found it overall nice - although not to an extent that I would want to drink it again. I loved the aroma though, it was a pleasant beer."
Honker's Ale,3.93,"12oz bottle dated 21SEP18 poured into my mouth looks awful, but I remember it being more on the dirty orange end of the color scale and with active bubbly carbonation.

Aroma is flowery, fruity hops and that flows into the flavor to which is added a good caramel malt for balance.

Mouthfeel is lighter with a slight stickiness.

Overall this is very much like beer."

L -- Ruby red with total clarity and a soft pink head

T -- Again, primarily dragonfruit and passionfruit, with a decent backbone of clean lacto acidity for sourness. Not much else going on, besides a clean wheat bill
F -- Light mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Drinkable and refreshing
O -- Not as great as Miami Madness, but still quite tasty -- I feel like many brewers are testing the waters with 'clean' sours like this

DFPF,4.48,"This beer is one which truly lives up to the hype. At times beers like this gain a cult-like following without having the commensurate quality, but here that is far from the case.

The taste exudes the balanced fruits, and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself, but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy. It is still thin and refreshing. I have had this on draft, in bottles (19 and 20 releases) and have loved every sip of it. It is well-blended and balanced, and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness.

I love this beer!!"

T: White grapes, candied citrus fruits and hints of fresh strawberries. Grassy and herbal. Sweet and bitter. Slightly zesty.

F: Full and soft. Low carbonation.

Dorado,3.73,"Had an 8-oz pour at their tasting room in San Diego's Little Italy (See My Review). The body is a sparkling amber color crowned by a thick and splotchy head, which produces a gummy lacing around the glass rim. The nose consists of a whiff of mango. There is an initial blast of hoppy bitterness that is supplemented by a lingering malty fade with an unbalanced sweetness. At the finish, there is a dryness that will require some water. Still, not bad."
Dorado,3.15,"Unknown vintage; drank 9/8/15 @ the Yarchives.

Semi-opaque bright orange appearance.

A rough pour yielded a big off-white head; frothy lace.

Fresh soap, mango & pine notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Pine & fresh soap flavors up front; bitter grapefruit notes on the finish.

Not my DIPA profile & a bit tough on the finish; not one I'd seek out."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.49,"Purchased from the international Beer Collector Christmas sale in November 2021 and drunk in July 2022.

The beer comes in a sturdy-looking, green, corked bottle. There's a satisfying pop and hiss as the cork is pryed loose followed by a whiff of ""smoke"" and an immediate orchard fruit scent at the neck of the bottle.

On the nose, as previewed at the opening, there's peach and apricot, spicy yeast, vanilla and pepper. Wow, I've not even had it in my mouth and I can tell it's going to be something complex and special.

In the mouth, spicy Belgian yeast dominates at first, but the orchard fruits quickly announce their presence. There also the vanilla from the nose and bitter orange peel and candied lemon. At the swallow there is substantial, earthy bitterness that's quite sharp and not at all what I was expecting. The finish is dry but the bitterness lingers long after the swallow.

Mouthfeel is luxurious. It's smooth and counteracts the lingering bitterness well. There's quite a bit of carbonation, but the sweetness, bitterness and bubbles all work together seemlessly. A follow-up mouthfeel demands attention.

Overall, this is a magnificent beer. There's complexity that isn't always evident in saisons or farmhouse ales, which takes the beer beyond the standard Belgian yeast, lemon candy and pepper/herbal profile that those styles can fall back on. I can't remember a better saison or farmhouse ale and in fact can't remember too many better beers full stop.

Cheers!"
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.18,"Vinous and elegant, with orchard fruit impressions plumping it up and a tangy yeast funk drying it out, quite a brew... Stone fruits like peach and apricot accompany white wine grapes with a twang on the finish - amply carbonated and lightly spicy with notes of cardamom, clove, ginger, and nutmeg... Sediment on the finishing pour..."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.13,"a delicious saison, lots of things going on, nice levels of funky farmhouse flavours, leathery, oaky, nutty, has a dank quality to it, some nice sweet flavours, pear, apricot, caramel, lot of vanilla, some brown bread also, champagne, spice, medium bodied with high levels of carbonation, shows it’s strength nicely, medium bitterness on the finish, quite dry, really quite nice to drink, good stuff"
Avec Les Bons Voeux,3.79,"Look - nice golden fairly clear with slight rimming and head

Taste - apricot banana floral slight funky and boozy

Overall - pretty tasty, almost hefe ish"
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.04,Tastes like a triple and a Saison had a baby. That’s what this beer taste like
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.04,"1.7oz bottle purchased from the fridge as a single. L20253B; I think this means that it was bottled December 2020? Something like that and I do recall purchasing this around this time of year last year. This is approximately one year old.

Look: Pours a very nice rich golden color with a very faint haze. A fluffy off-white head of very fine bubbles has stuck around and remained as a pinky finger high. The head looks a bit like meringue.

Smell: Very nice aroma. It's very peppery up front, and there's also a lot of fruit aroma in there too. Clove, banana, esters, orange zest, some sweetness (honey?) and some alcohol. Smells like it's going to be dry.

Taste: Interesting. It is thirst-quenching and refreshing. It definitely has a strong leaning toward the dry and bitter, somewhat boozy flavor profile. I can definitely see how this beer is a borderline saison / Belgian triple. Up front, it's a bit sweet and fruity, very effervescent. The finish is slightly sweet at first and then it quickly changes to bitter, dry, and spicy/herbal. It's suprisingly drinkable at 9.5% ABV. Overall, it's clean and crisp. There is a lot of refined malt behind these flavors. After pouring the sediment, the flavor profile became much more clovey and spicy.

Feel: The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. It has the perfect amount of carbonation, makes for a luxurious mouthfeel with the bottle conditioning.

Overall: This is a nice beer. I think that I prefer some other saisons to this one, but I am definitely glad that I get to try this one as it is a bit different. Definitely try this one if you like Belgian triples."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.01,"Great looking beer. The head is eternal. Has a very earthy, rustic aroma. Cracked peppercorns and grass. Surprisingly hoppy.

Nicely balanced flavor. Classic Belgian yeast, banana. Some stone fruit. Light funk. Very boozy.

Sharp carbonation. Very dry finish. Medium bodied.

Very good overall. Nice balanced flavor, with surprising drinkability."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.47,Wonderful balance with enough carbonation but not too much. The slightest amount of bitter but enough to give you some bitterness. Very very well done
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.23,"Bottled 10/13/20

The strongest saison i think I’ve had before. I usually love a high proof beer I think I find it to be a bit of a negative here. It’s just not hidden at all. It’s a great looking and feeling beer as I drink it. I like the flavors going on. A fun beer to try but I’ll probably pass on getting it again."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.06,"2021-07-18
750ml bottle served in a little Cantillon glass.

Pours a clear light honey color. Medium sized head that looks kind of coarse until it collapses into a thick ring and it looks pretty creamy. Smell is light, grassy, earthy, a little honey. Maybe some flowers and grass.

Taste is a funky punch in the palate with a kick of alcohol. Earthy, yeasty flavors, mild tart apricot, grape-musty-bitterness.

Mouthfeel is highly carbonated but not very light-bodied. Overall, it's a very nice beer."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.32,"A large earthy hop presence. Something about it reminds me of dusty libraries, uncooked mushrooms. I get major holiday spices, candied oranges and ginger. Slight sharp lemon notes. Leads to a light and quick finish with each sip. Exceptional."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.25,"375ml bottle from Wee Beer Shop, Glasgow:
A hazy, light amber with a beautiful, foamy white head about 2cm tall that looks thick & has excellent retention. Floral & spicy upfront on the nose, it was a peppery aroma with citrus fruits, Belgian yeast, coriander & the odd sweet malt. It's a funky nose & there's hints of pear, apple, clove & very faint banana to finish. It's funky tasting too, opening with citrus, yeast & apple flavours with a little pear, white grape & some of the alcohol too. There's floral hops coming through with some of the spice from the nose, sitting on top of a medium, sharp body that's dry at the end & strongly carbonated throughout."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.33,"Look: nice hazy yellowy-orange color with a think foamy white head

Smell: huge yeast, farmy funk, citrus, dark fruit

Taste: funky, yeasty, banana, clove, like a cross between a saison and a triple

Feel: strong but smooth carbonation"
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.62,"375ml bottle - 2019 vintage

Pours a lovely cloudy hazy amber gold orange with an enormous fluffy creamy dense white foam head with good retention. Smells a bit sweet and strong, with aromas of honey, caramelized malts, fruity esters like ripe banana, dried apricot, green apple, pear, mild green peppercorn spice, some barnyard farmhouse funk, musty hay, straw, some wildflowers, and fresh herbal earthy floral hop notes. Tastes lightly tart, piquant, slightly boozy, bitter, fresh, floral, spicy, sweet, and quite pleasant. Pretty intense flavors follow the aroma, strong and warming, with rich toasty golden caramelized honey malt flavors, sharp green apple, pear, banana, dried apricot, lemon, phenolic peppercorn clove spice, mild farmhouse funk, musty hay, straw, wildflowers, and bitter earthy herbal floral hops. Feels soft, medium lighter bodied, airy, creamy smooth and dry with crisp moderate carbonation. Overall a real nice and strong saison."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.55,"Aroma - pear, ginger, mint, lychee, peppery phenol, rose, anise, all under a big rich pils base.

Flavor - moderate pils malt sweetness, lush spice and herbal hop, light vanilla note, very cohesive, perfumey, not even slightly bitter, green apple, ginger, cumin, lemon/lime

MF -no alcohol heat, meium-light body w/ a whiff of alcohol in sinuses

Overall - had this beer a few times over the years, ranges from meh to best beer I ever had. Freshness is of course key. One of the better ""super saisons"" out there for sure."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.65,"I had this on tap at the Toronado. Strong beer. Tiny pour. Clear and golden, minimal foaming. On the nose there’s a pronounced funky estery note. Wet hay and bloomy rind, par excellence. It’s floral, yet spicy, and I see where the comparisons to a Belgian triple come in, but I find this more of an amplified saison in all the right ways."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.25,"a: bright, slightly murky burnt yellow with some vibrant orange notes. huge, 4 finger rocky bright white head

s: awesome aroma. big hit of barnyard funk upfront, green apple skins, pears, lemongrass. wheat, grass, grains, pepper spice. coriander and some cardamom. tart strawberries, and sweet citrus. touch of straight lemons to. huge bready backbone to it all

t: some sweet apples right away. green apple and ripe pears behind that. some subtly sweet lemons & orange follow. bready, malt characteristics aplenty in here, as well as a little alcohol flavor. there's a touch of funk in here, but it's not as strong as the nose would have indicated. lemongrass, sweet grains, straw round this out

m: fuller side of medium, with high carbonation

o: excellent stout. it's a little sweeter than i would have guessed from the aroma, but this is oh so good. excellent summer beer, though this is the highst ABV i've encountered in a Saison.."
Avec Les Bons Voeux,4.31,"Vintage - 2019.

A - VERY hazy medium gold color that's borderline opaque. Lots of frothy white head that's easily two fingers thick with lots of cascading carbonation. The haze subsides as the beer warms.

S - Banana, clove, light spicy earth, somewhat yeasty with a little hit of bread on the nose. Very dry and aromatic on the nose, I could smell it from two feet away when it was poured.

T - Yeasty, banana, pepper, cloves, some spiciness, and some lingering green apple pear on the very back end. The alcohol presence is detectable in the beginning but halfway through the ABV is barely a factor.

M - Thick with carbonation pricklies on the tongue and very dry.

O - This is recommended."
Anchor Steam Beer,3.76,"On tap.
Clear copper. Two fingers variegated cream head. Full cap and lacing.
Malty bready, light fig, stone fruit aromas.
Wheat bread, light nut, floral flavors.
Light body, good lasting carbonation, bitter aftertaste.
Tasty and a nice change from hop forward diet."
Anchor Steam Beer,2.33,Its a really carbonated and standard malty beer. I get a festive-Christmas like after taste from this beer which reminds me of nutmeg or cinnamon. I don't like that part. Earthy and nutty is how I would describe it. However more earthy. It's not a bad beer by any margin just not something that I enjoy. I leave beers for my own record so based for my tastes it's a 2.5 type of beer.
Anchor Steam Beer,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into narrow gauge pint glass.

Appearance: Copper colored body. Big & dense bone white head.

Smell: Malt forward aroma. Light caramel, toasty, slightly nutty. Earthy hops perhaps? They are light and its hard for the nose to pull out the aroma.

Taste: Toasty, grainy, and lightly nutty malt profile. A bready element in there as well. Complex and smooth malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. Gentle earth and floral notes.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. moderate carbonation level. Creamy textured body.

Overall: My first time drinking a California common / steam beer. This beer was an obvious choice because it is readily available with a wide distro footprint and it's one of those old school beer's that has a certain nostalgia about it. This is a really excellant beer. I can see why it's iconic beer for sure. I would drink a bunch of these on a hot day at an outdoor potluck or BBQ."
Anchor Steam Beer,4.08,"Dark amber body with a lasting white head leaving a nice lacing.
Caramel, wheat, banana, light hop notes but no bitterness. Pretty good for a session able beer."
Anchor Steam Beer,4.33,"Purchased as a six-pack of bottles from Ingles for $10.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear orange-amber, with a one-finger slightly cream head that goes away rather quickly. Not too much lacing.
S - Floral and earthy. Caramel. A bit of resin, too.
T - Wonderfully complex! Starts off nice and bready (think pumpernickel and brown bread), and leans into a hoppy wave of earth and floral notes. Ends on a bread crust note, and a lowly toffee air. A slight white grape note is present throughout. Well-balanced, for sure!
F - Medium-bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Refreshing. Super drinkable.
O - My first steam beer, and I've got to tell you - it's the perfect fishing beer. Well-balanced and complex, while not being super overwhelming. Refreshing and crazy easy-to-drink. Tons of flavor. Highly recommend!"
Anchor Steam Beer,4.04,"Poured from a 12oz can.

The look is a nice solid amber, crystal clear with lively carbonation and a one finger head. Dissipates over a minute to a thin covering. No lacing

Aroma is giving me strong malty lager vibes here. Very lager aroma maybe some hops here, but they are definitely a small amount of bittering only hops. Maybe a bit of off aroma, slight skunk even with the can, but it could be an older can.

Taste leaves the off flavor right in the dust this is delicious. Right up front is amber lager similar to the aroma but it quickly goes into a weird ester-y altbier sort of thing and it's very interesting theres quite an evolution on this one despite seeming pretty basic when I got into it. Some hop bitterness on the very back end. Dont know what to really compare it to. But it's quite malty.

Feel is nice and creamy big body in the mouth bit still very easy to put down. Its al.ost like a milkshake in texture but liquid and carbonated if you can catch my drift l. Probably not but it's good. All year.

Overall a very interesting beer. I'm glad I got it. Not really comparable to any other style, but so easy to drink malty decadent lager ale wonderland, despite the cover (which your not supposed to judge by) only looking average at best."
Anchor Steam Beer,4.23,"I ordered a Fat Tire, but the bar was out and the bartender recommended Anchor Steam as a good alternative. I'm glad he did.

Look - dark amber, nice head that lasted.

Smell - malty with hints of sweetness

Taste - really good. The malt shines with just the right amount of hops in the background

Feel - Above average with moderate carbonation

Overall, I really enjoyed this and will order it again if I see it on a menu. I've never seen it in stores around me (southeast)."
Anchor Steam Beer,3.99,"Two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug reveal a pretty colored beer. It's brightly copper-amber and rather translucent. The slightly off-white head is much larger than what should have been expected for a reasonably gentle pour of a chilled brew. Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat."
Anchor Steam Beer,3.54,"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber from the can, light, creamy 1"" head with moderate retention but great lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with sticky malt, toffee, and light yeast notes; barley tea as it develops deeper on the palate. Taste has a very light malty sweetness balanced with enough bitter hop to indicate it is there. Mouthfeel is smooth with gentle carb. Overall, cooling and refreshing."
Anchor Steam Beer,3.96,"Appearance: Clear, copper color. Frothy, off white head with good retention

Aroma: Mostly herbal with some caramel malt note

Flavor & Aftertaste: Spicy & herbal. Hints of mint. Moderate to mild bitterness.

Mouth feel; Full bodied. Medium length, clean finish.

Overall: The first craft beer I ever drank. Can't believe it took me this long to right a review & notes. It's full bodied. Presents herbal & spicy hops aroma and flavors on a mostly sweet malt backbone. There is hint of mint. Moderate bitterness. Nice, easy drinker. More flavorful than typical American golden pilsners/lagers. Nice looking beer in the glass. Always a joy to revisit."
Anchor Steam Beer,3.68,This is one of my all-time favorites. Not for any one thing but for the sum total that it is. It's not too heavy to drink a four or so and it's heavy enough to know you are not drinking watered down corn fermented corn juice which I detest. The hop amount is nigh on perfect for the masses yet enough for the aficionado who discerns the kind and type. They never need to change this one as it is the perfect high-quality everyman's brew. I say that but it does command a more premium price than a everyman's brew and in most areas is only available in sixers (i.e. no 12-packs and no cases which is a huge mistake). I have only one more thing to say and that is I would drink this happily if there were no other brews and that is in spite of the new yellow and blue labeling which sucks as the previous label was the absolute best in the who brewing business.
Anchor Steam Beer,4,"L: Pours amber. Mild carbonation and nucleation. Remarkably clear.

S: Roasty toasty barley. Bready sweetness, and a touch of hops.

T: Tangy and zangy, caramelized grain.

F: Thick and bready flavor but it's rather lightweight.

O: I would relate this to Shiner Bock or Okocim. It's rather nice. I'm going to read about it and see what they have to say, now."
Anchor Steam Beer,4.38,"Generally an underrated beer. Pours a crystal clear copper color with an off white head, the slight head from 12 oz bottle dissipating in a few minutes. A clean malty nose with a mild more English ale hop note. This beer has a wonderful malt and hop balance, Lightly carbonated, an enjoyable clean malty taste with a crisp bitterness, think northern brewer / Kent goldings, unique in style, with a total absence of the typical Cascade piney notes. Totally unique and the canonical steam beer, the mix of pale and caramel malts provide a very slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the level of bitterness. Very drinkable, a really lovely beer."
Dancing Man,4.49,"Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHops.
So good!
A lot of banana character.
Would not have guessed 7.2% either."
Dancing Man,4.01,"Appearance: Pours a clear, glowing, medium orange color with a moderate white head that sticks around. SRM of 8 (3.75)

Aroma: Strong aromas of bread and spice upfront. There is bread, cloves, and Belgian spices. Some coriander and banana before a bready and banana malt backbone.

Flavor: Strong flavors upfront of sweet bread and bananas. There's cloves and spices. Prominent bread malts with yeast and clove spices on the finish.

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Good carbonation. Finishes with cloves and banana bread that linger pleasantly. Balanced. (4.25)

Compared to Boulevard Tank 7 12/12/21: Pours a lighter and clearer color with a milder white head. More bread, banana, and clove spice. Less juicyfruit. Drinks more malty and smooth.

Overall: A very tasty hefeweizen here. I don't get much cinnamon here. Yet, nice bready, banana, and clove spices. Yet the carbonation comes through here for a nice balanced and clean finish. I think that is what makes this beer drink so well. I enjoyed this one for sure. (Final Rating: 4.01)"
Dancing Man,3.23,"12oz glass bottle - review from notes

Slight hops and spice cut through, but its mostly honey, nanners, and clove. A little too sweet

Classic banana hefe with hefty alcohol"
Dancing Man,4.5,"Thanks to Bshaw22, I finally had the top 3 Hefeweizen of BA
This is, in my humble opinion, one of the best American brewed Hefeweizen.
I will make it to the brewery some day and have it on tap."
Dancing Man,4.61,"L: Pours a beautifully cloudy burnished amber, and even with a fairly careful pour, formed a four-finger head of dense off-white foam. Plenty of tiny bubbles visible racing from the bottom.

S: A delightful bouquet of ripe wheat, bubblegum, clove, and white grape.

T: At the risk of redundant repetition, ""delightful"" seems again apropos. Each sip opens with a lovely slurry of clove and banana flavor, with some pear and white grape notes developing as it moves across the tongue. By the swallow, some light citrusy coriander tones join in, and linger alongside the clove for the aftertaste.

F: That is as lush and pillowy as one could want a wheat beer to feel. The phrase ""cream of what"" came to mind as a descriptor for this brew's mouthfeel.

O: That is decidedly impressive for a US brewed hefe. Dan clearly picked up a trick or two during his time at Ayinger. I'll be trying to find this (and Bubbler) any time I'm able to get near Wisconsin during the brewing window."
Dancing Man,3,"The spice in this one is strong, overpowering to the point of being funky. Did not really like that."
Dancing Man,4,A good wheat beer. Can taste the banana and I believe cinnamon. A tasty and smooth drinking wheat. A bit of of a dryness which i have not tasted in other wheat. Definitely a wheat i would buy again.
Dancing Man,3.84,"Bottle reads 'E221'; consumed on 3/26/21

Pours a lightly hazed copper-tinted golden body sporting a rangy effervescence and capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a thin layer of craggy cap, a thick, frothy collar, and broad, uniform webs of lacing holding firmly to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings charry bubblegum and firm, almost mineralic, yeasty spice opening with a distant waft of stone fruit underlying; earthy clove over the middle and subtle banana expanding from a background position across the olfactories is established and direct, while sweeter clove evolves to close the bouquet.

Taste offers peppery spice and raw clove upfront into subdued yeasty characteristics persisting over the mid-palate toward a decidedly wheaty back end, where tinges of earth, flaked malts, and a slight minerality phase into a wisp of booziness sneaking through the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a light body along with a fluffy puff of airy carbonation phasing easily to a crisp, wavering consistency appealing to a slightly thinning, quenching lightness on the palate, eventually firming up on the back end as a taut, flaky textures finishes.

While an assertive profile accentuates some classic stylistic touches alongside a slightly more modern, earthy twist, the booziness remains somewhat apparent across this higher-octane Hefeweizen."
Dancing Man,4.24,"12oz bottle. Etched at bottom edge of bottle is '0203260043738'.
Slightly cloudy, deep gold colored body. Bit of a gusher upon removing the cap. Two fingers of high head after pouring. Big burst of effervescence following the pour. Leaves behind a few spots of foam.
Aroma of banana and bit of cloves and cinnamon.
Taste of banana and spices, along with the sharp wheat note. A touch of both sweet and spicy. A flavor of green apple comes in at the end. The yeast esters continue into the aftertaste.
Medium for mouth feel and for smoothness. The higher ABV% delivers a bite. Quiet in the mouth, with minimal carbonation.
Easy to drink because of the low carbonation feel in the mouth, and the slight dryness that calls for another quaff."
Dancing Man,4.24,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into a 20oz. weizen glass. It filled the glass to the the top with a pure white three finger pillow of foam. After several minutes the foam settled back to a thin layer with nice lacing on the side of the glass, The beer is a hazy orange with a medium carbonation, small but a steady line of bubbles.
The smell is mostly a very nice banana - bubble gum aroma.
The taste follows the nose, banana, bubble gum,, some clove, wheat, cinnamon, & pepper.
The feel is slightly creamy, I'm surprised, I don't really feel the carbonation at all.
This is a fairly high octane at 7.2%, it may take a couple of sessions to put this sixer away. This is a very good Hefe, the taste, the look, very smooth given the high ABV. I will need to sample this one with it's German brothers and do more comparing!"
Leaner,4.52,"Look - Hazy Orangish copper with a really nice white head and rimming and slight lacing
Smell -easy peach tart
Taste -really nice slightly tart peach and wood
Feel -medium body and creamy
Overall - love it"
Leaner,4.45,"Pours a dark orange with a foggy transparency. One finger of off-white foam fizzes up top, dissipating quickly. Aroma is tart and abbreviated. It hits peach right up front, but it's soft. Stone, lemongrass, oak, green grapes, and grass all add some depth for a clean, playful smell. Flavor profile is delightful, with sweet peach right out front. Peach is mild, never commanding the lead. Accents of white wine, stone, faint pear, oak, and lemongrass establish the rest of the flavor profile. It starts out tart, leaning into sour at the end. It also finishes with a more acidic bite than the start. Mouth feel has a bubbly start, but soft finish. Thickness is medium. Overall, peach is really pleasant, and compliments the underlying beer well. It posses just enough tartness to tighten up the jaw, but not enough to wreck the palate.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 750mL bottle. Batch #2. Reviewed from notes."
Leaner,3.97,Too acidic and not quite the same 'whole peach' character as the Casey Leaner. Aroma is great I just find the acidity overpowering the sweet peach notes on the palette.
Leaner,4.5,"Mega sour. Lacking the funk character of the Casey blend. Overall, this is a good beer, but it needs to be served with a side of Tums. Worth a try if you can get it at cost."
Leaner,4.49,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark yellow/orange hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of peaches, love it. The taste follows the smell with the typical SP acidity and a light peach flavor. Its an awesome beer and tasty nonetheless."
Leaner,4.63,"Blend #2.

Beautiful golden hue introduces notes of fresh peaches and subtle oak. The palate bursts with a bright, fruity acidity that paves the way for a lingering sour pucker and a pinch of tannic dryness. So damn good."
Leaner,4.37,"On tap, poured into a stemmed wine glass. Stout white head with good lacing. Nice deep golden color. Funk and peaches on the nose. Tart peaches are up front. Some light acidity towards the end of the sip. Medium body. Nice to finally try this one."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.23,"On first taste, smoothness is more prominent than taste. Not too sweet. Has a well balanced stout flavor."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.87,"12 oz bottle
Glass: Nonic Pint
Temp at Pour: 47 F
ABV: 6.1%


Look:
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here.

Smell:
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there.

Taste:
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium

Overall:
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.29,"L - black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - notes of semi sweet chocolate, roasted dark malts, coffee - smell is somewhat faint
T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.62,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature."
Special Double Cream Stout,5,"It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer.

On the newer brown label, the words ""Double Cream"" are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as ""doubly sweet stout"" rather than ""sweet double stout"", which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion.

In other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :)

I've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.83,"Opaque black, minimal lacing. Smell of coffee, roasted nuts, burnt sugar. Taste follows, low carbonation, borderline silky. Nice."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.02,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly jet black color with a large and massive tan head that slowly elopes into the stout in liquid form. An ever transformation of head into beer that is a beautiful show. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate to strong aromas of smooth coffee roast, creamed coffee, and chocolate milk. Mostly smooth coffee roast and creamed coffee. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of smooth milk chocolate, sweet cream, and creamed coffee. A soft body with a smooth finish. Some smoke off the end. (4.00)

Feel: Medium bodied. Soft, and smooth. Moderate carbonation. (4.00)

Compared to Bells Porter: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More creamed coffee and cream. Less roasted black malt and roast.

Compared to Founders' Porter 1/25/22: Pours a similar color with a slightly lighter colored head. Similar aromas. More smooth chocolate and cream. Slightly less airy coffee roast. Overall, similar.

Overall: This is a pretty good sweet cream stout. It pours an gorgeous appearance. The flavors are primarily focused around creamed coffee and that's what this beer reminds me of. I'm not a milk or cream stout person, but this one might change my mind and could grow on me. (Final Rating: 4.02)"
Special Double Cream Stout,3.41,"Pours black with a finger of off white head reducing to a thick cap; decent lacing. Nose is bitter coffee, herbal and earthy hops, and bakers chocolate. Taste follows suit. Fairly bitter, earthy, not much sweetness or cream. Mouthfeel is thin and watery which is to be expected of the ABV I suppose. Okay beer. Won’t seek it out further."
Special Double Cream Stout,4,"12oz bottle served in a nonic glass. Packaged 09/24/2021. PRN 34794.

Appearance: Very dark brown, with some ruby red highlights at the edges. Thin tan head with some persistent sheets of lacing noted.

Smell: Sweet, roasted malt with some chocolate (cocoa powder, milk chocolate) notes. With a swirl, some coffee / espresso notes and just a bit of a metallic copper aroma.

Taste: Well blended sweet malt, cream/lactose sugars, roasted malt, coffee-like bitterness, and a little bit of char bitterness with a hint of tobacco as well.

Mouthfeel: Certainly holds up to its name. It's nicely thick and creamy smooth. Light carbonation underneath it all.

Overall / Drinkability: A very good stout, and went well with some chocolate covered pretzels. I think this would pair really well with a burger as a substitute for a milkshake. A bit of a sipping beer and I'm finding one is enough, but I would definitely get again."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.16,"Look: Poured black as strong coffee with a light tan head. Bubble foam lace on the glass.
Smell and Taste: Cocoa and coffee notes. Sweet but no overpowering.
Feel: Smooth going down but slightly watery.
Overall: Could use a little kick in the ass with a higher ABV. Gosh, am I starting to should like an alcoholic? LOL"
Special Double Cream Stout,4.2,"Pour is esthetically pleasing, no head with a nice straight pour to the bottom of a tullip glass. A nice lacing surrounds the outermost layer of the glass. Best enjoyed cold, but not ice cold. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, hazelnut, roasted malt, with less of a creamy taste but more of a creamy feel. This is the kind of beer that leaves you feeling warm, that snuggles the inside of your stomach. The earthy-ness brings in autumn vibes, a beer best enjoyed sitting next to a fire that’s fueled with oak wood. Not considerable dry. Overall a great dessert beer."
Special Double Cream Stout,2.6,Lactose...Lactose...Lactose...(sigh)...a sweet stout must have Lactose...period...think Mackesons stout...very disappointed.
Special Double Cream Stout,4.02,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. PKG 9/13/2021, so pretty fresh.

L---Darkest brown with orange around the edges. Medium light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left nice lacing.

S---Malty as advertised. Coffee & toasty malts.

T---Follows the nose...coffee and roasted malts.

F---Medium/full bodied. Creamy, as advertised.

O---A really nice one. Would get again."
Special Double Cream Stout,4,Picked up at the local mart. So surprised they had it. Remember this one when it was the cool label. A perfect stout for this autumn evening.
Special Double Cream Stout,3.42,"Virtually no head when poured on tap. What little foam there is, dissipates quickly. Smells and taste of coffee, slight vanilla, and spice. Bitterness level is just right. Nothing really stands out, pretty mediocre"
Special Double Cream Stout,3.97,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 08/17/2020. Sampled April 4, 2021.

It pours near black with a modest, diminishing tan head.

The aroma has a little chocolate and vanilla with a mild floral hop profile underneath.

Light to medium mouthfeel.

The taste is also creamy and dark but the finish feels clean to me."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.88,"L: Pours black as night in color with a bitchin, tall espresso head.
S: Smells rich of coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, slight amount of coffee.
T: Very much follows the nose, sweet dark fruit flaor.
F: Low carbonation, full-bodied, silky, smooth.
O: Not a bad brew, I'd just like it to be more roasted."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.37,a little too bitter for my taste.
Special Double Cream Stout,4.26,"A: Glistening highlights of Merlot outline a pour that was a rich chocolate color. A milky froth capping of one finger, was tan-hide in color, was short lived. Tiny effervesce bubbles slowly make their way though the darken experience in the vessel with a solid gold lace band encircling above like a halo.

S: Creamy rich and milky chocolate character with some marshmallow highlights on the opening nose. Eloquent milky coffee roast is freshly grounded and straight to the glass. Dark chocolate is sweet along with some burnt caramel and cocoa. There's a bit of smokey sweet dark fruit about, cherries and plums in particular that mixes with some roasted pine and silty charred remains. When all is said and done everything blends beautifully together in a balanced way.

T: The flavor was equally rich and rewarding, sweet vanilla and milky roast is very flavorful, along with some smoky wood highlights. Burnt molasses and caramel creamer add sweetness along with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries. There is some roasted pine hop leaves, milky lactose that blends well with the subtle smoky character and backbone. Wet silty ash hints are smooth as silk.

M: Full bodied experience on the mouthful, very creamy, with a lot of depth. A softly carbonated presence with just the right amount of tingle for a big stout beer. Warm roasted warming on the hold.

O: Overall a perfectly balanced brew, smooth and softly roasted sweet cream stout that is dessert in a glass with an exceptional drinkability. Sweet vanilla, rich coffee roastiness defines this drink, like a smooth Italian coffee. Huge creamy mouthful is the explanation point along with a lingering wet silty bitterness that begs for more sips. Poetry in a glass."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.1,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pitch black in color, perhaps a faint ruby on the edges. Somewhat sized brown head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: toasted/roasted grains and malts, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, lactose, burnt caramel, and toffee.

Taste: I'm tasting the toasted/roasted grains and malts especially with some hop bite. Also tasting some more bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Because of this, the sweet notes mentioned in the aroma have more of a minor role, although I can still taste the lactose/milky notes somewhat well. Body is medium-light."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.99,"Serving: On tap at Brasil (Houston, TX) served in a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Relatively opaque, dark brown with ruddy tones. Pours with a short head of tan foam and leaves a few streaks of lace.

Smell: Toasty roasted grains and hot chocolate.

Taste: Less assertive roasted malt; coffee, chocolate and caramel. Leans a little sweet and boozy but remains restrained.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth feel and softer carbonation.

Overall: A solid and drinkable, malt focussed stout. Went down well alongside morning coffee."
Special Double Cream Stout,4.12,"Pours like a syrupy coca cola. Not as fizzy. Very little head in my teku glass. Still practicing smelling - this one I get cold coffee - making me wonder if it would get better as I let it warm up, has been chilling in my very cold fridge. I'm also getting bitter dark chocolate in the smell. I can't wait to taste. Nice classic stout flavor. Not too bitter, some coffee flavors, as I let it rest on my tongue I get a slight numbing experience, only 6.1% abv though. The mouth feel is not as creamy, not as silky as I remember stouts to be, this one being my first in at least a couple years, but I feel like that makes it a bit more drinkable. I do want some water after, it's like a dessert in that way."
Special Double Cream Stout,3.77,Good - didn't really impress though.
Chocolate Stout,3.62,"draught (nitro)
IBU: 69
Velvety, tan head. Thick and bold, black looking elixir. Soft, dark and caramelized, roasted grains, for the aroma. Slightly watered down, dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is OK."
Chocolate Stout,4.69,"This beer is really good. Beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. First sip and you already taste the chocolate. This isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout, this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. Probably higher on the calories so probably only have one, but if you get the chance to try it, do it."
Chocolate Stout,3.88,"Not really into chocolate but friend dropped off some stouts and this was one of them. Would not buy it but for what it is, it’s well crafted. Dessert beer. Makes me miss lagers."
Chocolate Stout,4.25,"Pours a very dark color with nice head and lacing
Aroma has very generous dark chocolate hints
The taste follows the nose with a well balanced very enriched chocolate flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A good Stout"
Chocolate Stout,3.53,On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black body with a nice creamy khaki head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malt. Tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. Milk chocolate without the milk. Roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. Medium body and very drinkable. Low carbonation. Hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.
Chocolate Stout,3.94,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Black colour, huge brown head. Sweetish aroma with strong notes of chocolate / cocoa, also notes of vanilla. Silky mouthfeel. The flavour is moderately sweet, again with dominant notes of chocolate / cocoa and vanilla, but also a distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Not bad at all."
Chocolate Stout,3.84,"Notes from 2011. Had this on draft.
A: pours dark brown, blackish body with small, tan head with ok retention and lacing
S: smells like sweet, cocoa, dark chocolate; smells like a sweet chocolate bar
T: bittersweet, like bakers chocolate taste; subtle alcohol notes; somewhat robitussiny; ok overall
M: pretty smooth and solid
D: nice mouthfeel and taste combo; good overall; a bit medicinal"
Chocolate Stout,4.5,"A: Pours a nice rocky head. The head looks like chocolate milk so great start so far. Color is almost completely opaque. The little light that filters through shows a dark brown.

S: Smells of luscious chocolate. A good amount of sweetness, almost like frosting. Nice nuttiness and the malt character really comes through.

T: The cocoa is so present, but never seems to take center stage. The milky creaminess starts and is just so mellow. The roasted malts and the bitterness builds beautifully until the hop spice pops the bubble and clears the pallet. It finishes with a long drawn out chocolate aftertaste. The hops are a bit distracting and I honestly wished there was a lot less hops. It balances the drink and cleanses the palate, but I never feel like I get to fully bathe in the richness before being snapped out of it.

O: This is the adult version of a chocolate milk. So smooth, so drinkable. A clear flaw that changes this drink from indulgent to simply great."
Chocolate Stout,3.65,"Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark pour... nearly black with big foamy mocha head. Great lacing.

S: Smells fantastic... big roast and milk chocolate.

T.F: Bittersweet roasted malts. Chocolate is present but not nearly as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe... kind of syrupy. Mild coffee... a bit of hop bittering and pine to boot. Lighter bodied than it should be. Fairly smooth. More bittersweet processed cocoa at the finish.

O: This was decidedly average... and nowhere near as good as the rating would have you believe. Looks good. Smells good. Taste... meh. There are WAY better chocolate stouts out there."
Chocolate Stout,3.3,"Disappointing. Smells and looks good, but the chocolate flavoring tastes like the chocolate syrup served at a buffet. I’ll skip this the next time I see it."
Chocolate Stout,4.35,"Great chocolate stout! i agree, balance between bitter/sweet is off to my palete, leans more bitter for style... not sure if it's Hopping or to much roasted malts.. i think overly hopped! but damn tasty. brown to tan head that lingers awhile, nice aroma, good chocolate in taste, medium mouth feel. carbonation right on! great, could be tweaked to super great! I've turned many people towards dark beer with this one! 50/50 men, women! their dubbel chocolate... an easy 5!"
Chocolate Stout,4.28,"Beautiful very dark brown/black appearance. Nice tan head that stays thought drinking it also has great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, slight smoke, and roasted malt. The taste is as described heavy chocolate taste upfront then the roasted malts and oats come through gets quite bitter on the finish. Too bitter in my opinion could do a better job of balancing the sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy, medium bodied and quite dry on the finish, nice amount of carbanation."
Chocolate Stout,4,Bomber from Albertsons. Near black pour with small creamy beige head. Rich dark chocolate aroma. Taste adds light bitter roast to the chocolate. Velvety feel.
Chocolate Stout,4.03,The pour is jet black with a tan & frothy head. The aroma is of dark chocolate & roasted malts & the taste follows suit. If you're looking for stout with chocolate added to it then look no further because this beer delivers. There is a date on the front of the bottle. I like chocolate stouts but i'm more of a coffee stout drinkers so this beer I would not care to revisit. Cheers! A-
Chocolate Stout,3.98,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a slight mahogany tint and a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick lacing.

S: Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder, bittersweet, and milk, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a little char, a touch of smoke, earthy, slightly piney, toffee sweetness, and a hint of dark fruit.

T: Roasty, big bittersweet and milk chocolate, a little vanilla, some char and faint smoke, earthy piney bitterness, toffee sweetness, and a touch of dark fruit on the back end, mostly cherry and plum.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy.

O: Definitely lives up to the name, super chocolate-y. My main gripe is how assertive the bitterness is. I feel like if they backed it down 10+ IBU it would be even better."
The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.93,"On tap for TBBW 2021 “Sorta Rad” Event.

2020 Vintage. Thick Nutella bomb. Crazy adjuncts, with coconut more restrained but really coming out on the tail. Barrel is great, with a roasty bitterness and touch of oak on the palate; good heat on the finish. If you like hazelnut this will blow your mind."
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),4.9,"#101, yummy!"
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),4.29,"Aged bottle. Jet black with hints of brown shading, brown cap. This one is more fitting of the dark lord moniker as it doesn't hold anything back. Huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge, roasted malt, coffee, solid rustic oak, molasses, dried dark fruit, and vanilla. Taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced, barrel stays strong, vanilla steps up, caramel enters in, dark fruit fades away. Feel is big, boozy and dark, just what they are going for, even with some age it still bites. I'm sure this will be controversial but I like the non-ba version better as an all around RIS, but when in the mood for a beast of a beer this will suffice, tough certainly on the sweeter end"
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),4.35,"I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!

The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer.

It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great."
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),4.6,"2nd DL variant. Regular DL is good but the variants that I have tried (BBA, CHEMTRAIL, FVM, RRARI CROCHET, LOADSTAR, PORTUGUESE BRANDY BA) were all amazing."
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),4.9,"Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.

Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying.

Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat.

Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The body did not seem as thick as some of the other variants.

Overall - It is amazing what a plain bourbon barrel will do to Dark Lord."
Goudenband,4.42,"Had this on draft 9/1/22 @ the Hopleaf.

Mostly see-through brown/orange appearance.

Dark cherry, lemon & mild vinegar notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Dark cherry & lemon flavors up front; artisanal vinegar & honey notes on the finish.

Elegant; so easy to drink for a ""sour"" beer. A stunner."
Goudenband,4.4,"750ml bottle. Paper wrapped bottle. Caged and corked bottle. Label says blended in 2016; cap has imprinted date of '09 2026'.
Ruby brown colored body, with reddish backlit highlights. Thin light tan head, which sticks around. Lacing sticks on all non-drinking sides.
Aroma of red wine with earthy, dark fruit.
Taste is woody, but also sweet from the fruit - apple, cherry, and raspberry. Has the caramel also. Aftertaste trails off quickly.
Medium mouth feel, and slightly smooth and syrupy. Carbonation is not a big deal here.
Tastes like a cross between a merlot and cherry cola. This aroma and taste expression is not often found. Slightly different flavor nuances are discovered with each sip. Really a treat. Very good paired with blue cheese."
Goudenband,3.31,"On tap at Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, NY.

This one pours a dark-ish murky brown color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like damp wood, cherry juice, green apple, pear, and red wine vinegar.

This is simultaneously too sweet and too vinegary for me - it's kind of a cloying medicinal sweetness for me, and when mixed with the old stale vinegar aspects, it definitely clashes. There's some nice woodiness and cherry skin, but it just doesn't work out for me. I know it's a classic beer, and maybe I'm missing out on something here, but it's just a contradictory set of flavors for me.

This is medium bodied, with a lower level of carbonation, and a soft finish. It's not particularly sour, by any means.

I wanted to like this one a lot more, but maybe it's just not for me."
Goudenband,3.77,Hard to tell exactly what it is trying to be although it grows on you. I was hoping for more funk and candi sugar but it wasn't there. Probably would like it more after more tries
Goudenband,3.75,"330 ml bottle, from the Norwegian importer (I could swear I had rated this beer before, but apparently not). Dark reddish brown colour, large beige head. The aroma has first a whiff of smoke, then notes of red wine, red wine vinegar, oak and horse stable. Pleasant flavour, malty, fruity and only moderately sour, again notes of red wine, red wine vinegar and oak, hardly any noticeable hops. Still easy drinking, due to the fruitiness. The alcohol is well hidden. Nice one."
Goudenband,4.56,"I will be doing this review in the form of a side-by-side comparing the 2011 to the 2019 vintage. The score can be applied to both, as I found them equally enjoyable despite their subtle differences, although I would probably subtract some points in regards to mouthfeel for the 2011 vintage.

Upon pouring, the color is an identical reddish mahogany coloration, with the 2019 managing a much more impressive, medium and fluffy, somewhat lasting, head while the 2011 pours with no head at all and the difference in carbonation is already noticeable here.

The nose is not quite as different as expected, with both vintages having a similar aroma of caramel malt, toffee, dark fruit and red berries, as well as some oak and tannic accents to them. The 2019 feels a bit brighter in the nose though, with the red berries, cherry, raspberry and cranberry in particular, standing out the most here, with lighter plum as well, while the 2011 has a deeper aroma to it, with the dark fruits taking over the red berries a little with additional notes of raisin and fig, although the red berries are still present.

The taste very much follows the nose, with a very similar overall flavor profile that varies a little in accentuation. The 2019 feels a bit more acidic, fresh and vibrant, with the tart red berry notes of cherry, raspberry and cranberry standing out the most, while the 2011 is a bit rounder and more mellow, with not quite as vibrant, but deeper and a bit more complex dark fruit and red berry notes of raisin, fig, plum, cherry and elderberry, while it also has a richer caramel malt presence, making this one a little sweeter, with a more distinct toffee presence. Also, the 2011 feels perhaps just a little bit more tannic, with just a hint of balsamic vinegar creeping in, although there's a very similar amount of musty oak to both of them.

I think that the biggest difference between these vintages probably lies in the body and mouthfeel, with the 2011 having quite noticeably less carbonation to it, feeling just a little flat, although it's really not too bad.

Overall, I was quite surprised by how similar these tasted at 8 years apart, with the 2011 being almost 10 years old, but then again I guess it really makes sense when you consider that this is not a hoppy beer to begin, which is quite focussed on the malt and bacteria in the first place. I honestly didn't believe the label at first, which states that ""even after 10 years this tastes as fresh as ever"", but this really is mostly true, with very little oxidation and signs of that typical sherry character showing through here.

Of course it's not quite as fresh, but the flavor profile really is very similar, with the 2019 feeling a bit more tart and vibrant and the 2011 a bit more sweet and mellow, but I did like them both equally for their different accentuations, with the 2019 being more fresh and expressive and the 2011 more complex and well-rounded overall. Although, once again, the difference really is quite subtle here, which I think is amazing considering that these are 8 years apart. I really do think that carbonation is the most noticeable difference here, which is why I probably prefered the 2019 just a little bit, but they both make for a very enjoyable drinking experience that is quite vibrant, rich and well-balanced, just with the focus shifting a little."
Goudenband,4.44,"This is truly an excellent beer! Bought from an evidently discerning gastropub/bottle shop.

Pours a beautiful clear dark brown color into a tulip glass, great beige head and beautiful curtain lacing. Funky smell and taste, dark fruity smell. Taste of sweet and slightly tart dark cherries. This is a 2016 vintage and the flavors are well blended and subtle.

One of those beers that makes you think you should always go Belgian!"
Goudenband,4.25,"2016 bottle

Khaki head. Lace. Dark brown color. Cherries, but not sour or dominant. Caramel and oak. Toffee. Faint sweetness. Kind of dry. Dark red grapes. Very complex."
Goudenband,4.37,"L: A Deep ruby/garnet cherry coke red. The thick dark tan head has a faint pink tint and quickly dissolves into a film.

S: Not much of a scent, just a light aroma of cherries and hay

T: Tart pie cherries, hay, grass, wheat, ripe yeast, maybe some dry apple cider and oak

F: Full bodied with mild carbonation, tart at the front crisp and smooth at the back

O: This is good, damned good. The tart fruit flavors are perfectly balanced with the malt and hay.
The feel and finish is rich and smooth without the sharp acidity that oftens turns people away from this style.
I normally save this sort of beer for cool nights, but slightly chilled, it also makes for a nice summer beer.
The cap says to drink by 2025, I now have seven bottles in my basement and I'll have to make a conscious effort to keep one until then."
Goudenband,4.44,"Without consciously trying, new beer: 2016 Liefman’s Goudenband. I was deliberating and didn’t want to tap anything from the usual stuff. I have two of these, so time for a try. Looks like a doppelbock in the glass, but drinks all sour...traditional sour, not Mas Agave sour. No head at all. On the tongue you get a quick sour bite that leads you to think it’ll be too much, but it backs off to a pleasant tart fruit flavor, IDK, like raspberry with granny apple. Good malt finish. It doesn’t show a lot of carbonation, but it feels lively in the mouth despite looking dead still. Alcohol is in the imperial range, low enough to keep you from getting hit too hard too fast. Surprised a little. Very nice beverage."
Goudenband,4.14,"A: Pours a murky brown with soapy tan colored head. Retention is ok and there is little lacing.

S: Smell is pretty low intensity. You get some balsamic vinegar, tart cherries, oak notes, rye bread and green apples.

T: Much less vinegary than expected. You get some balsamic vinegar, tart cherries, green apples for the tartness. But, you also get some malt notes with brown sugar, rye bread. Vanilla and oak tannins from the barrels. Very cider-y honestly. Some stone fruits with plums, prunes and some raisins. Quite complex.

M: The star of the show. It's broad, soft, round with a very fluffy carbonation. One of the best mouthfeels in a while for me.

O: This is a very good beer (especially for the money). It's very complex, not too vinegary with a great mouthfeel. Really enjoyed my time with this one."
Goudenband,4.51,"Medium: Capped + tulip glass.
Opacity: Deeply veiled with low activity.
Color: Dark brown with a shiny copper hue.
Head: Slightly creamy brown half a finger.
Legs: Poor but good lacing and decent swirl reaction.
Smell: Balsamic vinegar/Cherries/Toffee.
Taste: Red grapes/Cider/Wild yeast/Floral.
Feel: Red wine/Sour/Yeasty/Woody.
Body: Medium oily and kinda fluffy, still smooth and well rounded.
Carbonation: Good sharp crisp of great balance.
Overall: Impressive unique flavors. Exquisite quality, one of the finest example of a Flanders Oud Bruin having a strange fresh feel behind that sourness. Also quite warming and makes a perfect appetizer while still easily drinkable for the whole bottle.

Goudenband,4.17,"Reviewed as part of BJCP training, 23C Oud Bruin

Pours a tan richer creamy small m head, fair retention decent lacing, dark but clear mahogany brown

Nose big fruity esters, deep plum, fig, black cherries, but sour and some acidity but not acetic or vinegary, under that rich sweet malts, toasted with caramel, toffee, little biscuity, candy malt, mild vinous age, touch of alcohol

Taste malty, more sweet candy and syrupy malts, caramel and toffee like later, quite fruity more plum, black cherry, prunes, more sherry vinous aged character, as well as low sourness and tart with light acidity, no acetic or vinegar, sweet sticky sour finish, mild alcohol

Mouth is fuller bod, medium to lower carb, mild acidity harness and little alcohol warmth

Overall what I was expecting, quite complex between malts, fruity esters, sourness, alcohol, etc"
Goudenband,4.17,"From the 330ml bottle, blended in 2017, it pours a solid brown with a modest head, quickly diminishing to a thin ring. Definite scent of apricots, cherries and malt in the nose. The mouth gets a well made sour with cherry undertones and a solid malt backbone. Yum!"
Goudenband,3.81,"I have been guarding this for six years. It poured a dark reddish-brown color with no head whatsoever. Cork did not produce any stomp.
Mild but nice malty aroma with notes of prunes, oak, a bit of cocoa, fig jam, toffee, caramel, lots of grapes, gooseberry and black cherry.
Flavor starts sweet and ends somewhat tart with notes of oak, grape juice, gooseberry, mild vinegar, some lactic acid, green apples, orange drops, sour cherry, distant mint, caramels and magnesium. Dry aftertaste with restrained sourness.
Medium towards full body with almost flat carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is well disguised
Oud Bruin with great malt and dark fruit complexity that is a reference for the style. This resembles a lot red wine, but malty. Sourness is restrained, in line with the style. A bit higher carbonation would have enhanced the experience; sure it should be considered this was cellared for a long time."
120 Minute IPA,5,"This review is for the 2022 release.

Best beer I have tried in a long, long time. Absolutely fantastic.

So much flavor but not overpowering, wonderfully balanced. Hard to believe it's over 16%"
120 Minute IPA,4,"Poured from the bottle into a clear chalice-like glassware. Dark amber color. Aromas of caramel, malt, booze, and vanilla. Definitely a strong feel of the alcohol, but it doesn't overwhelm."
120 Minute IPA,3.79,Yah unfortunately I have to say it’s a bit silly. Just too much. Worth a try to see if it works for you but in the end not for me.
120 Minute IPA,3.7,"Been wanting to try this beer out for a long time now and finally came across it at a local liquor store that sells a wide range of craft beers from all over. The store owner said that he was sent two cases of it. So anyway, I pay $40 (!) for a 4-pack and rush home to put a bottle in the freezer… First off, it looks fantastic. Pours a deep copper color with good lacing on the glass. The smell was a little surprising though; seemed very malt-forward, like a good beer that had sat in an unconditioned garage for a couple of years and the hops had been burned out of it (yes, I’m familiar with such scenarios; when you have wildly varying temperature changes of 20 degrees in the winter and 110 in the summer, that ugliness can play havoc on an unprotected beer. Welcome to NW Florida). The taste was unexpected as well. I thought some serious hop action was on the way but said hops seemed nonexistent. I typically don’t care for hop heavy beers but hey, a balance would be nice. And strong? Yeah, you could say that. You can almost feel the alcoholic vapor rising up out of your chest. I couldn’t find an ABV anywhere, although BA says it’s in the 18-20% range and that seems about right. So bottom line, this is a serious beer that demands attention. Is it all that I expected? Not so much. A good barley wine maybe. Don’t get me wrong, I like this brew, but I guess the hype just left me wanting a little bit more. Still, I feel comfortable giving it a solid 4 out of 5."
120 Minute IPA,4.57,"My father in law gave me a $50 bill to spend on some fancy beer, so this is what I chose. I saw the 4 pack sitting on the shelf for $42 and knew right away that's how I'd spend the money. I've had the 60 minute and 90 minute as everyday drinkers at my local bars on Saturday nights out, but never thought too much about them. But I knew given this beer's reputation I had to try it eventually. Poured out pure gold, richly golden, glowing with a copper luminescence, but it's murky and dense, and cannot be seen through. A beautiful white head formed that dissipated into a mess of mismatched bubbles around the rim of the glass. The smell is all orange and lemon zest, perhaps some grapefruit in there too. No alcohol on the nose. The taste is richly citrus and a full strong wash of hops, bittering and balancing the sweetness of the fruits. Hints of grass and wheat, and a golden touch of honey complete the sphere of flavor. The beer bounces around in my mouth in a lively brew of bubbles, and is quite thin and watery that goes down quickly and easily. I cannot detect the astoundingly high ABV that is present in this beer. This tastes rich and full, but not any more strong than what i remember the 90 minute to be. Overall, this is quite refreshing and lively, thirst quenching and smile inducing. It's not particularly unique, but i don't think it has to be to earn higher marks from me. I'm in Florida and in this heat this is the perfect summertime brew and I'm glad I'm drinking it on vacation. I noticed several reviewers are comparing this to a barleywine, and I would agree on that point. Two thumbs up."
120 Minute IPA,5,"This is the most satisfying, delicious, and outstanding DIPA I have ever had the pleasure of consuming! Words are unable to describe the blast of flavor. Clocking in at 16% ABV and 120 IBU, the absolute highest, this brew will not disappoint!"
120 Minute IPA,4.4,"Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, 15-20% ABV. Pours clear copper with a two-finger off-white head that left prolific lacing. Nose is sweet toffee/caramel. Taste follows, more sweet than bitter, and boozy. Decent mouthfeel, lightly dry, decent carbonation. Overall outstanding. This will knock you on your ass."
120 Minute IPA,4.13,"Beautiful copper hue, clear and an attempt at a head.settle for a bubble ring
Notes of caramel and burnt sugar,
Butterscotch and caramel, like some cognac qualities hop bitterness as well.
Medium feel, liqueur booziness feel.
I've drank many times over the years so decided to review."
120 Minute IPA,3.75,Super boozy feeling and loses the charm of the 90 min
120 Minute IPA,4.44,"Better categorized as a Barleywine - this potent potable is strong, sweet and bold. Not for a casual drink, the 15-20% abv asserts itself more quickly than this guy is used to experiencing. Tastes sweet, with an excellent mouth feel."
120 Minute IPA,4.04,"2022 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours golden copper amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little thin lacing.

S: Sweet bready malt, big honey, citrus, floral notes, dark and stone fruit, some spice, resinous pine, and a bit of alcohol that gets stronger as it warms.

T: Candied citrus, orange marmalade, lemon, and grapefruit, resinous pine, spice, underlying fruity notes, apricot, peach, fig, white grape, and golden raisin, bready malt, brown sugar and honey sweetness, and a little alcohol.

M: Full body, moderate carbonation, slightly syrupy, definitely a little alcohol warmth, though it's pretty well managed and never really gets unpleasant or overwhelming.

O: Another beer I know I've had before, but never logged, so here we go with a fresh bottle to establish a baseline before cracking into a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it's an absolute behemoth. The 2022 edition sits at 16.6%, so not the full 18-20% of old, but still plenty big. There is a hop presence so there's no denying it's an IPA, but there's also a ton of sweet malt there as is required to hit that ABV. Well made and fun to try fresh to say you've had it (Go for a short pour or share a bottle with a buddy), but if you're after a big and hoppy experience, stick to DIPAs and TIPAs. (4.04)"
120 Minute IPA,4.6,Awesome Beer!
120 Minute IPA,4.17,"2019 bottle.

Pours a cloudy, semi-opaque dark brown color. Thin off-white head forms and dissipates quickly leaving just a thin layer of foam.

Aroma has notes of old piney hops, light maple sugar notes, some rich malty notes and some mild raisin or date fruit notes.

Taste follows the nose with a blast of rich malts, strong piney hops, with some notes of raisins, dates, caramel, molasses, maple syrup, Even at 4 years old - this is still extremely hot. it warms up the pit of your stomach as you sip on it.

Feel is thick, syrupy, warming and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Semi-dry, trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is a unique beer that is a must try, even if it is not one to drink often. To me, its essentially an American Barleywine - but a really well done one."
120 Minute IPA,4.18,"Drank way too much of this when on tap locally, outstanding compared to any bottled version previously. This is no light beer by any stretch. Impressively concocted, but there's just a ton of both malt and hop. Fun to try."
120 Minute IPA,4.56,"Tell you a story.,. I used to have keg parties in my backyard long ago and far away. Live music, BBQ, tackle basketball, etc.
It would get to about 10 PM and everybody was feeling right. Then my friend Daniel would show up with a jug of Wild Turkey and everything went to shit.
So nowadays, I be sitting with my beer buds (or beer and buds as it were, having lain down liquor 16 years ago) and long about 10:00, I’ll whip out a couple of 120’s and split ‘em up in tasters, pass ‘em around. Cheers!
Everybody gets goosebumps, cheeks turn red, and they make ‘that face’. (I truly mean that in the most complimentary way.)

120 Minute IPA is an Extreme Novelty that always satisfies. Sweet and hoppy, boozy and offputting, lowbrow and dispicable - yet the most underrated beer in America.
It’s a nipple pinch - whether you like it or not, you know you got pinched.
Can you dig that?"

Society & Solitude #6,4.49,"3 months old. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours an opaque orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

S: Ripe orange and grapefruit with some piney, woody hints. A bit of mango as well.

T: Orange, mango and peach. A bit piney, grassy and herbal. Both hoppy and malty. Not as sweet as its smell. Minimally zesty and a bitter finish.

F: Full and creamy. Low carbonation.

O: Nice East Coast/ West Coast hybrid IPA uniting fruity citrus notes with piney and grassy hints. As always, great craftsmanship from HF."
Society & Solitude #6,4.31,"On tap at Armsby Abbey.

L -- Hazy golden orange in the glass with the usual fluffy HF head that lasts and retains wonderfully
S -- Mango sorbet, orange juice, yellow grapefruit zest, lightly creamy oat malt, and a light berry note
T -- Wave of pithy yet creamy citrus pith, citrus flesh, and dried blueberry, followed by a moderate earthy bitterness that is pronounced but rounded. Light malty sweetness makes for a nice tapering finish that continues to be lightly bitter
F -- Soft, fluffy, drinkable
O -- A hair more bitter than my favorite S&S variants. Still fantastic, as expected

Society & Solitude #6,4.39,Super fresh can from M-Fox24
Society & Solitude #6,4.71,"From a can purchased at Hill Farmstead. Beer was canned on Tuesday, consumed on Thursday. Beer pours a moderately hazy yellow-gold, big white head of foam, scant lacing. The smell of Mosaic hits upon pouring, with big notes of sweet berry, along with citrus, tropical fruits and a touch of pine. Taste follows. Another immaculate construction. Hill beer is magical."
Society & Solitude #6,4.25,"This was really well done, but perhaps single-hop mosaic is not really my fave. Quite sure it was fresh, but smelled and tasted too much dank for me and slightly cloying. Maybe a bad can? Will retry any 100 if given the chance."
Society & Solitude #6,4.56,"Absolute Mosaic crusher. Mango, pine, and grapefruit on the nose, with a beautiful contrast on the palate of fresh herbs, underripe peach, and bitter citrus. Big and bold, but drinks so easily and finishes with the perfect amount of bitterness."
Society & Solitude #6,4.44,Enjoyed from Tim
Society & Solitude #6,4.77,Hoppy smell but flavor profile more balanced.
Society & Solitude #6,4.47,"16oz. can into a Founders snifter.

Hazy color but with a perfect 1 finger rich white head with excellent retention. Nose is pine, grapefruit, starfruit, and pineapple. Fresh, juicy, and grassy all at the same time. Beer opens pineapple, grapefruit, and starfruit. Grassy in the middle with a rounded, juicy body. Soft, pillowy towards the end with more grapefruit and starfruit notes. Bone dry at the finish. Extremely balanced. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Bone dry on the palate and quenching and soft going down with the same, dry finish. Perfectly drinkable.

The flavor is there but the best thing about this beer is the body. Perfection!"
Society & Solitude #6,4.44,"L: Hazy, pale straw yellow with a creamy white head and good lacing.

S: Mango and papaya with a touch of pine resin, not over the top but still very aromatic. The malt is subtle but is combines with the yeast to create a subtle fresh baked bread note.

T: Very mellow bitterness, big ripe mango, citrus and pine flavors with a clean malt backbone. The yeast seems to be contributing some fruitiness as well.

F: A dry, moderate body and a crisp, low-carbonated finish.

Overall: An excellent NE-Style IPA that showcases mosaic hops very nicely. This beer is all about hop flavor just as any beer in the style should be."
Wit,5,"One of the best Wits on the market.
It doesn't get much better than this."
Wit,4.14,"Bought at Liquor Shed for ~$9 the 4pack. Best before December 1st 2023.

It pours a lemonade colour with a huge billowy head of foam. Good lacing.

Smells of coriander, light cloves, some pepper, mild sweetness, no bitterness.

Coriander, cloves, pepper, pleasant fruitiness...orange, sweetish, no bitterness. Yummy.

Good mouthfeel, very easy drinking. Excellent."
Wit,4.26,"Look: Very yellow - goldish pour with a bit of haze. Light foam, about less than a fingers length.
Smell: wheat, with a good fruit smell to it - that of apricot, maybe even slight orange.
Taste: Definitely tasting apricots, slight orange, wheat, light spice at the end, definitely resembles bubble gum in the end.
Feel: Light carbonation, light to medium bodied - slight sweetness to the drink.
Overall: Definitely a good drink! Will end up buying again in the near future."
Wit,5,Probably one of the best Belgian wheat beers out there love that perfect malty Cyprus and a bit of sweetness at the and perfect beer for Ivan Brew beer garden! Cheers!!
Wit,3.53,"1/28/22 Very pale thin white head, just a cap, a little lacy; I smell nada; flavor is so so; Good mouthfeel; a not bad session beer but I prefer a more robust flavor. This beer is highly rated, but for me it's not nearly as good as some of their others, Christmas Ale for example.

The can says 5.0% ABV. BA says 5.5%."
Wit,3.83,"I found this one a bit boring. Tastes lemon and apple, smells citrus. Looks cloudy straw."
Wit,4.18,"It's not exactly Belgian wit weather (just barely above freezing in my neck of the woods), but I couldn't resist these squatty little cans sitting on the shelf. Of course, I get the things home and see that they're cans in the standard Bernardus 11.2 ounce format. I was guessing 8 oz. max just looking at 'em. Oh well. Not complaining. More beer for me.

There is some ink stamped to the bottom of the can, but I'll be damned if I can determine what the shit it means.

Anyway, this pours with a solid two fingers of head floating over a slightly cloudy pale straw body. Carbonation is incredibly active with a steady procession of bubbles floating northward. Beautiful webs of sticky lacing form as the head recedes. Smells a little light to my sniffer; grainy with mild banana taffy notes. Maybe a little light citrus around the margins. Yeah; oranges for sure. Lemony too. Smells nice, everything's just a little muted. Taste amps up the banana notes up front, but the citrus really takes over on the back end. Finishes smooth and perhaps a touch salty(?). Maybe I'm just losing my marbles. Super soft mouthfeel lends itself to chugging which I might be inclined to do were it warmer. This is a really nice, well-made beer that is far more nuanced and subtle than most of the stuff I've seen and/or been drinking of late. Super cheap, too, by today's standards so there's going to be a lot more of this filling up my beer fridge in the future."
Wit,4.03,"I bought a mixed pack Belgium beers from this brewery and enjoying every bottle so far .
330ml bottle at 5.5%.

Appearance. Hazy straw colored body with a rather weak head.
Aroma. Typical for style îf slightly cleaner and with a bit less banana.
The flavor follows, and sets a fine standard for the style."
Wit,4.28,"Poured into a grip shaped goblet: color is straw, slight haziness, bright white head with fine bubbles presents about 2 fingers thick, dissipates to a solid top with lacing on the glass sides.

Smell is light wheat, light wit yeast, light spice with coriander notable.

Taste is similar but so well put together, like Allagash white, just really well crafted flavor and nuance: wheat, light spice, unique to this beer, light malt, yeast is available in flavor, light bubble gum, coriander, teaberry like notes, pepper, lemon, grassy, herbal hops.

Mouthfeel is low/moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, low bitterness.

Overall a very, very good beer and style defining."

Fort Myers Beach, FL

Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a chalice

Look: Pours a cloudy pale amber (SRM 4) with a scintillating white head. Along the circumference of the glass, the fluffy head is retained while the body rises to eclipse its core.

Smell: Yeast at the forefront with white fruits like white apricot close behind. In time, clementine emerges with a twinkle of hops.

Taste: A backdrop of sourdough provides a canvas for lemon zest and clementine with a crack of fresh ground white pepper.

Feel: Well and finely carbonated. Uplifting.

Overall: A bright wit beer on the lemon side. It doesn't pay much homage to coriander, but uses the opportunity to discover itself."
Wit,4.48,"11.2 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass.

L---Cloudy, bright golden color. Fluffy white head had good retention and left beautiful lacing.

S---Wheat and yeast are up front. Some spiciness (coriander) in the background. A bit of lemon.

T---Follows the nose closely. Complex & wonderful.

F---Medium/light mouthfeel. Well carbonated.

O---It says on the can, ""The Classic Belgian Wit"". They are not lying."
Wit,3.45,"From an 11.2oz can pours cloudy and golden. Creamy aroma. Somewhat mild flavor and medium carbonation. Tastes almost wild-fermented. Pretty good for the style, but not top notch in my opinion."

I really enjoyed this wit. It had the distinctive smell of apples with a light taste on the tongue. One of the better wits I’ve had."
Very Green,4.54,9/15/22 Canned 5/6/22. Another 100 World Class beer by TH. Let it warm a bit & it turns special.
Very Green,3.68,"Drank from a 16oz can, don't know how it looks and can't smell much from a can.

Mouthfeel: Smooth as a dolphin. Maybe too smooth? I would be happy with more of a carbonation bite.

Taste: I don't think it's as citrusy as people are saying, but that isn't to say there is no citrus/tropical fruit. Fruity up front then quickly transfers to a puckering bitter floral/piney taste. Almost reminiscent of a west coast at the end if it wasn't for such a creamy mouthfeel.

Overall: pretty decent. I wouldn't say it's a 100 beer. I think the hype over Tree House might be pushing people too far one way but it's definitely a good beer. It's worth trying, as all beer are."
Very Green,4.3,"pretty cool to have new beer friends in idaho that have access to this stuff, i thought being this far out west now i might never get to try some of these, pretty highly rated stuff here, way up on the top 250 list for one ive never had, so impossibly stoked to get into this along with a couple of their other ones, a rare drinking experience indeed, at least for me. i think we out in this part of the country forget that beer this hazy and dense can also be beautiful, they dont have to all be murky and dull because they are matte, and they dont have to look heavy and sedimented just because they arent clear, this is starchy looking yeah, but its pretty in its solemn bigness, and the creamy dense shaving cream white head sits on top like this is a belgian, others take note! there is also no appreciable change to gloop in the bottom inch of the can, thank heavens! definitely some quality issues out there in the world compared to this one visually, i needed to see this. the aroma and flavor here are on the precipice of being over hopped, green indeed, but not following through with the burn, and not really smelling and tasting like pellets, more like orange juice from concentrate to be honest, pineapple and tangerine juice, mandarin oranges from the can, green grapes in my old school lunch box, white wine too maybe, and just enough earthy grain to keep it beery, surprisingly no harshness even though it walks right up to that line. there is balance here, just a little breadiness from the yeast, and more bitterness than expected, its not all juice, still finishes like ipa. i get some alcohol too, its not over the top, but it definitely drinks like a double with that and all the body, soft carbonation and pillows going down. the flavors of this are excellent but this doesnt hit like something super original in terms of ingredients or processes, i wish they told us what they hops are, but its the execution that sets it apart for me, the quality is epic, so often copied but only on rare occasion equaled. this was a joy to drink and i am thankful for the experience. high end but not radical, if that makes sense. i wish more were refined to this degree, its memorable for that reason. exceptional, but not even in my top handful of hoppy beers these guys make..."
Very Green,4.64,"Poured on 5/29/2022 from a 16oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 5/27/2022 into a tulip glass.

A: The beer is a very hazy light gold color, with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.

M: Crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time."

$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Very Green,4.21,"16oz can courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.

Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.

More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.

Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.

Really, really dug this. Really regretting only having one can. Thank you so much for this, Bill!"
Very Green,4.85,Very smooth with huge fruit and bitterness to balance.

Very Green,4.24,"16oz can at share. Hazy straw colored pour, small foamy white head. Aroma is soft, gentle fruity notes, citrusy, piney. taste adds some green, herbaceous accents for an overall light hoppy, fresh vibe. Really good."
Very Green,4.13,"Pours solid light orange, frothy 2"" head, great lacing. Nose is grain, tropical fruit, melon; rounder, fruitier notes than what I'd think of as ""green.""

Very Green,4.69,"One month old. Can to pint glass.

Smell: Orange and tangerine. Tropical fruits. Sweet.

Taste: Ripe citrus fruits. Mainly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Not as sweet as the smell suggests. Zesty, slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Medium hop burn.

Overall: A little less spectacular than the OG Very Gggreennn, but still a lovely brew. Perfectly balanced with a full body of zesty citrus fruits paired with a smooth tropical sweetness. Beautiful look, great mouthfeel."

Double IPA,3.5,"Shared bottle at local tasting, thanks to gunnar. ABV is 8.5%. Golden colour, huge white head. Sweetish aroma of malts and orange marmalade. Distinctly hoppy flavour throughout, very bitter finish. Maybe not very complex, but good."
Double IPA,3.62,"Presentation: 12 oz. can, served in a Samuel Adams pint glass.

Appearance: One finger head that sticks around for a while and leaves some good lacing. Cloudy, dark gold color.

Smell: Dank, musky hop aroma, some fresh citrus peel with faint malt and grain notes in the background.

Taste: Bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. It has more of a juicy, fruity, sweet citrus character which is nice. A faint, piney aftertaste remains.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and medium bodied with medium high carbonation.

Overall: Nothing new or groundbreaking here, which is fine. A solid DIPA and a damn good beer."
Double IPA,4.45,There’s a simultaneous malt & fruity kick on each sip. The piney aftertaste is blatant and incredible. Yummy beer!
Double IPA,4.25,"L: Hazy orange with a rocky white head. Medium-plus retention. A thin film hangs out forever. Rings of lacing are left behind.

S: Huge yellow grapefruit and tangerine aromas; spraying oils, juicy flesh, and bitter pith. Some ripe mango and pineapple, honey and caramel, and massive pine sap and dankness.

T: Orange creamsicle, yellow grapefruit peel, honey, toasted white bread, overripe mango, pine resin finish. Moderately sweet, although the finish grows crisp. Moderate lingering bitterness.

F: Medium-plus, well-carbonated, smooth, creamy, and well-rounded. Finishes slightly sticky and resinous, but fairly clean for the style.

O: A superb example of West Coast Double IPA. A delicious hoppy offering."
Double IPA,4.19,"A: Gold with rich white foamy head and very nice lacing.

O: Great DIPA, solid flavors and very enjoyable to drink."

O: A very good Double."
Double IPA,4.5,One of the better beers I have had in a while. The beer has a very nice aroma and a taste that follows the aroma and keeps one very satisfied. An above average beer definitely worth seeking out.
Double IPA,4.03,"*taken from notes
12oz bottled on May 9 2017 2558 poured heavily into my hotel's clear plastic cup.

Appearance- hazy golden/ straw color with a frothy white head. leaves good amount of lacing.

Aroma- oranges and tangerines.

Flavor- like the smell but with some caramel notes to add depth. bitterness to some could be kinda sharp. abv is well hidden. really dry finish.

Mouthfeel- solid medium bodied. good carbonation

Drinkability- easily drinkable for any hophead.

Overall- the orange and tangerine hop notes are the main thing in this beer. if you like ipa's and orange flavored things this is a must try for you. there is some sort of spiciness coming from this brew. don't know if it's from the hops or carbonation. as it warms pine notes start to come through. really solid."
I Will Not Be Afraid,4.25,"Roasty caramel coffee, toasty tree house mouthfeel, with just unmatched balance - enjoy beer for a non-BA milk stout. Enjoyed this quite a bit - not rushing back to have it again."
I Will Not Be Afraid,4.33,"Pours deep black. Aroma is quite sweet combination of caramel, milk chocolate, a little coffee, and a decent amount of vanilla. Taste doesn't measure up to aroma. Would have like a bit fuller mouthfeel."
I Will Not Be Afraid,4.16,"Poured into a 20 oz goblet canned on 1/19/22. Pours a very dark near pitch black with a tiny mocha head that settles rather quickly, leaving little to no lace. 4

Aroma is deep dark chocolate, coffee grounds, vanilla bean, toffee, and actually a little alcohol is present for sure. 4.25

Taste follows dark chocolate, roasty coffee, vanilla, toffee, and a little alcohol in the lingering finish. 4.25

Mouthfeel bigger than average, soft carbonation, a little dry, and at 9.3% it drinks bigger. 4

Overall this one would be better if it had more body in my opinion, but still a very solid Imperial Stout. 4"
I Will Not Be Afraid,4.4,"Canned 1/19/22. “He who has overcome his fears will truly be free” stamped on the bottom of the can

Man, I can’t remember the last new Stout I had from Tree House. They tend to excel at these Milk Stouts, so I have high hopes for this one. Plus this is one of the last few TH beers in the BA top 250 I’ve yet to rate, so I’m excited to finish up that list

Pours nearly pitch black with a finger of mocha head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is certainly sweet in aroma, but it’s not overbearing. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, chewy caramel, sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, and a touch of char

There’s actually a pretty good sense of balance here in taste, I wasn’t expecting a dry finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, chewy caramel, raisin, creamy coffee, brown sugar, light cherry, and cocoa powder. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, dark cherry, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light caramel, and roasted malt

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and creamy beer. Dries out over the duration of the swallow, leaving just the slightest stickiness

Damn, this is really good. Nothing overpowering but still full flavored. Hopefully they put this one out more often"
I Will Not Be Afraid,4.25,"Picked-up two cans at Tree House in Sandwich for $8.55 each. My two hundred and thirtieth brew from these guys. Canned on date of 1/19. Very good, a bit pricey."
Stone IPA,4.51,"First actual American IPA for ages...never heard of this one before...

Amazing head...a little bubbly...intense colour.

Aroma is phenomenal...melon is dominating. But not as deep and complex as many IPA's or Belgian tripels...

Wowow...this taste is off the scale. After 2 pilsners this literally sets my soul alight. Mouth feel is like an explosion, one of the best that I have ever experienced. Sweet melon, followed by the bitter hops that literally assassinates the melon and creates a ying yang experience...

This is amazing and I totally love it. I'm buying all of the cans in the shop next to me that sells it. As soon as they open.

How could it be improved? I'm not sure...the ying yang between the melon aroma and the mega bitter aftertaste is unparelleled in my decades of beer tasting (drinking till I forget everything) ; )"
Stone IPA,4,"Just a good, classic, standard west coast IPA."
Stone IPA,4,Vintage in this category and still one of the best ipas ever brewed. Can’t really say anything that hasn’t already been said. Is it bad that I’m drinking one at $13 in Chicago airport at 9:55 AM? Kinda days it all
Stone IPA,4.16,"Pours clear gold, nice frothy white head that retains well, sip by sip lacing. Citrusy hop bomb. Medium body, xlnt carbonation. Bitterness is a quality hallmark for my taste, so Stone IPA really delivers, without going completely dank. Well balanced everyday quaff, plus it’s readily available everywhere at a reasonable price point."
Stone IPA,3.81,"A gift from Bret, with a connection to UCSB. Thanks! Really pretty to look at, but I don’t see the business of taste as all that special. I guess it is just too long on bitter without much extra nuance."
Stone IPA,4.24,"One of my early go to IPAs. After many years, I've found Odells, Ballast Point, and Elysian provide citrus and floral hop notes that I prefer depending on the mood. Stone has a special place in my heart, a bit one note and not the absolute best. The price is right and is still in the rotation, sometimes for the memories it conjures up. Don't change it Stone!"
Stone IPA,3.33,"It's a high quality, well made beer. Just not for me. The finish is bitter to the point of being off-putting. I just do not want to take additional sips."
Stone IPA,4.71,The original and still one of the best. Haters gonna hate.
Stone IPA,3.9,"Golden pour with a medium amount of head that dissipates relatively quickly. Odor is dank, hoppy, and piney. Taste is traditional IPA with hoppy bitterness and a slight bit of pine. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Overall a good IPA."
Stone IPA,1.36,Stupidly bitter and unpleasant. it's the gargoyle that hypes this up.
Stone IPA,2.01,Wow. Way over rated. Or maybe just old school. Bitter baby. I get DIPA’s less bitter.
Stone IPA,4,"I revisit this one periodically, because at one time it was in my top 10 IPAs and I get nostalgic about that. Not sure if the recipe has changed over time, maybe it's just not been as fresh, I don't know... but I can only say it's a little better than okay in today's IPA world."
Stone IPA,4.02,"Pours a clear gold, big frothy white head, ridiculous amount of lacing. Citrus, and tropical fruits. Medium bodied, excellent carbonation. This is solid!"
Stone IPA,3.82,Pretty solid but a touch too bitter for my liking.
Saint Lamvinus,4.39,"On tap at Armsby Abbey

Welp, I inadvertently ended up here for Zwanze Day! I was at a show right down the road at Palladium and figured I’d come here after, only to find some true whales of mine. It’s finally time to see what their grape Lambic

Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak

There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and tart

Damn, this is awesome stuff. Not quite on par with Fou Foune, but it’s always nice to try Cantillon"

Saint Lamvinus,4.54,Magic is better but this is great
Saint Lamvinus,4.11,"Bottle, RBESG 2005, Grand Tasting. Cloudy reddish colour with brownish tones. Intense barnyard and ""fruits of the forest"" aroma. Intensely sour flavour, lemons with notes of raspberries and blackcurrants. Overpowering and delightful at the same time."
Saint Lamvinus,4.46,"L: Light maroon coloured with a one finger white, lively head.
S: Funky hay, red grape skins.
T: Deep flavour of red grapes. Some wood, tart finish.
F: Lively carbonation. Crisp.
O: Great showcase of grapes in a lambic."
Saint Lamvinus,4.5,"Amazing beer, always a pleasure."
Saint Lamvinus,4.47,"2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F.

Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.

Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil.

Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith.

Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins.

Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity."
Saint Lamvinus,4.58,"750 ml bottle, 2019, poured into a flute

A- A slightly hazy reddish purple with a small pink head.

S- Sour, red wine grapes, barnyard funk, oak.

T- Tart, red wine grapes, hints of berries, tannins, oak, nice barnyard funk.

M- Smooth, light body.

O- A very well balanced lambic and the grapes work very well in this."
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,5,Non BA is too sweet. BA definitely cuts down on the dessert stout aspect. Well balanced. My all time favorite dessert stout.
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.81,"2021 batch.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.

This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.

This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.

I almost didn't want this one to be good - I don't always like Angry Chair and this is such a hyped beer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for me, it's honestly awesome. This is the best Angry Chair beer that I've ever had."
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,4.34,"Bottle. Dark brown pour with a chocolate head. Huge chocolate cake bouquet. Well shit, that is a chocolate treat. Don’t get me wrong, this bad boy is Uber sweet but it’s exactly as advertised. It’s literally a liquid version of chocolate cake. As it warms up the bourbon, oak, vanilla start to show up. Really good body and mouthfeel."

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,5,"Had this stout at Angry Chair on 3/20/21 so I’m guessing it’s a 2021 bottle. A very nice guy sitting at the table next to me offered a pour from a bottle he was sharing with a friend to my wife. Needless to say, I drank her pour. Jet black color with a little bit of foam. Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own. The best pastry stout I’ve ever had. The first perfect score I’ve ever given on beer advocate."

Interlude,4.46,2016 vintage
Interlude,3.91,"Shared 750(?) ml corked bottle at local tasting, vintage 2007, bought at Ølbutikken or Høkeren, Copenhagen, May 2011. Ale aged in oak barrels, ABV is 9.5%. Clear orange colour, moderate white head. Aroma of brettanomyces, sour fruits and apple cider vinegar. Medium sour flavour, brettanomyces galore, woody finish, decent hops. Interesting and unusual."
Interlude,3.39,"What is this, a double saison? 10.4% and a 4.24 average, this outta be interesting.

Pours a darker color than almost any saison, guessing this took some barrel notes with it to the extent that it literally turned the saison beer darker. Or maybe its just a maltyboi. Or both. Anyways, its this mixture of dark amber and brown. Not much for head retention, maybe 1/4"" white at its peak, but really settles a lot less than that. The aroma had more of a belgian quad than it did saison vibe. But there was a bit of fruitcake like breadiness in the nose, seems this one has an ample amount of brett character/nose.

Taste brings all the dark fruit in the world into a beer with no dark fruit, no doubt the wine barrel brings a lot of that, but also this belgian yeast that doesn't seem like a saison yeast at all (more qua, bspa or bdsa). Mouth feel has a grip load of alcohol heat to it, not something I want in a 'saison'. But this isn't much of a saison, its more like a wine barrel aged quad. Not sure I really 'get' this saison."
Interlude,4.46,"2017 vintage. Poured from a Cork'n'Cage bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Cloudy pour... brown/amber color (looks like apple cider) with thin fizzy/barely there head. Modest ring of lacing.

S: Tart and fruity. Red wine and the cellar it's stored in.

T.F: Modestly tart... red wine and oak, grape must, funk, and plum. Dark fruits... leather, baking cherry, and black pepper. Medium bodied... light carbonation and sticky on the tongue. Complex... more red wine and fruit to finish.

O: An absolutely fantastic red-wine barrel aged brew. Great complexity and flavor... easy drinking despite some tartness and brett. Outstanding."
Interlude,4.6,"Bottled on 07/27/16

Interlude,4.56,"Cloudy copper, not much head to speak of, no retention or lace
Very vinous, but not winy. Brett derived fruitiness, some wine aromatics, hint of phenolics.
Flavor is very wine-like, but doesn't remind me of any wine I've had. Maybe it's the bit of malt backbone. Otherwise, follows the aroma.
Definitely doesn't feel like a 10.6% beer. Dry, the bit of tannins from the barrel keep in cleansing, no booziness
Dang good. Not something I'd drink all the time, but definitely enjoyable here and there."

Ground State,4.12,"2018 bottle properly cellared. Viscous black pour, tiny brown collar. Smell is full and rich with the deep and dark coffee, and chocolate, the bourbon, maple and vanilla are faint. Taste is improved, starts the same as the nose with the dark coffee and chocolate, but bourbon and oak make a warming entrance quickly, providing the maple a way to creep down the spine of the beer, together it is nuanced and dark. Feel is medium thickness, lightly warm, and mostly shaped by the coffee textures. It's good, but I would take CBS any day"
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.17,"750ml bottle into a tulip. 2018 vintage.

Looking very nice. Slow streams of carbonation through a deep plum body. Small pinkish tinged head replenished, though little lacing.

On tasting, cherries are the strongest flavor, but they don't overwhelm. Nice balance, tart and sour.

Mouth medium, finish tart sour cherry.

Overall, enjoyable drinking experience. Perfectly balanced for my fickle palate."

Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.25,"Review 1538
My continuation for trying a bunch of different beers. This beer is a fruit lambic I picked up a month or so back. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish head with excellent retention. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The head is creamy and foamy and settling to the bottom of the liquid. The color of the beer is 0reddish-purple with clarity.

The first aromas in the beer are cherries, lightly toasted malts, and sour lemons. Nosing further, I detect a touch of horse blanket, wet grass, toasted crackers, oak, and hay.

The flavors in the beer are cherries, fruity sweetness, oak, leather, a touch of farmyard funk, sourness like lemons, toasted crackers, hay, and lightly toasted malts.

The mouthfeel of the beer is tannic, tart, and carbonated.

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish.

The beer has a beautiful tartness and finished crisp. The fruit comes through but is not overpowering. The touch of farmyard funk is pleasant and gives the beer uniqueness. Solid fruit lambic, I enjoyed it."
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.4,"750ml green bottle. Caged and corked bottle. Label lists ABV% as 6, for ""Belgian Cherry Ale"".
Dark reddish brown colored body. Slightly pink, beige colored head, which persists as a thin bubble cap. Just a few small spots of lacing left behind.
Aroma has cherry and oak/leather farmyard funk.
Taste is a balance of cherry sweet and tart. The funk is more in the later portion, and shows oak, lemon, and leather. The more tart cherry and oak revisit in the aftertaste.
Medium mouth feel, with a dry finish. Good carbonation.
Sublime and balanced use of the cherry with the base lambic. All works together and nothing out of place."
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4,"375 ml bottle. Pours hazy dark red with tall, long-lasting, foamy pink head. Aroma is of barn yard yeast, vinegar and cherries. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is of cherries, wheat malt, funky yeast and vinegar. Finish is long and very sour. Nice sour brew."
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.5,"750 ml bottle, corked.

Pour is a very dark, natural-looking red. Very thick with a nice, pink head.

The aroma is all cherries: sweet and dark, with some very light spice nodes shining through as it warms a bit.

The flavor is a straightforward iteration of the style, but done to near-perfection. Cherries dominate throughout: organic tasting, very juicy, backed up by yeast spice and tartness. It's very smooth and drinkable from start to finish, never getting too sour or sweet. The balance is exquisite."
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.23,Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Deep reddish purple color with good initial head and nice lacing. Distinct smell and taste of tart dark cherries.

Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.39,"375ml bottle, best by 2038, into an Oud Beersel goblet.

L: Pours a deep, almost opaque vermilion body with ruby highlights. The two-finger head is purplish-pink and admirable for both density and retention. Excellent foam for the style, but the lack of clarity isn’t as great.

S: Soft, delicate, but substantial aroma of ripe cherries - all juice, no pit or skin. A hint of lemon is about the only other feature, but I’m enjoying it greatly.

T: Rich cherries are front and center, with some complexity from the base Lambic building in behind - lemon, straw, wheat. The cherry returns in the finish with a refreshing blast of tartness. Really, really good.

F: Relatively light-bodied with spritzy carbonation. Fits well with the zesty fruit flavors, but doesn’t allow much depth to emerge.

O: Terrific Kriek! Maybe not as deep or complex as my very favorites, but far better than most I’ve had - even from more celebrated producers. Beers of Fame tick 201/250. Cheers!"
Oud Beersel Oude Kriek Vieille,4.25,"Pours a cloudy, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a large, fluffy, pink'ish head. Smell is dominated by sweet and tart black cherries, as well as hints of musty oak and funk. Taste follows the nose, with an expressive sweet and tart black cherry presence and some rather musty, somewhat tannic oak notes, as well as some subtle, leathery funk and just a hint of balsamic vinegar, with a good underlying lactic, citric acidity. Finishes quite dry, with a medium acidity and some black cherries and musty oak and funk lingering in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While Oud Berseel may be one of the lesser known Belgian Lambic breweries, their beer certainly doesn't need to shun comparison with the greats. I already rather enjoyed their Geuze and this Kriek is no less impressive, featuring quite an expressive black cherry presence with a great balance of only lightly sweet and medium tart notes, as well as a rather dry and musty character, with some distinct, tannic oak notes and lighter, leathery funk, as well as a good, medium acidity and very nice, effervescent mouthfeel. Overall, definitely one of the better Krieks that I've had, pretty much only eclipsed by Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen and not by all that much. While it may not have a strong funkiness to it, I really feel that it makes up for that with its vibrant fruitiness and dry and musty character."

Ruby red, nearly crystal clear, solid medium+ carb with strong lingering head. Aroma is medium cherry, light musty funk, and a really pleasant herbal character with basil and something akin to mint, but not minty. Taste leans more to the cherry and light funk.

This made me think of my Dad, whose guilty pleasure was a raspberry milkshake from Dairy Queen. This is all raspberry, all day (and night and the next day) long.

I was wrong - so, so wrong. This is traveshamockery good. Stunningly world class."
Twice the Daily Serving: Raspberry,4.69,"Canned 11.11.21, opened 11.20.21

Brewers Notes: Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense, saturated fruit character in beer form. After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 6.47 and 6.51, we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style, with its delicate, yet fluffy mouthfeel and even-keeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions.

For Twice the Daily Serving, we've amplified the mouthfeel, fruit addition, and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date. Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries, this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color. Lively aromas of homemade jam, juicy raspberry, and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate. It finishes full-bodied, slightly sweet, and remarkably drinkable.

Loose Cannon,4.5,"I first tasted this beer many years ago, at least five or six. I had it from the bottle and thought it was good for sure, so I don't know why I never rated it. And I've never particularly bought the beer, but now we just had a growler of it which we purchased at State Line Liquors, Elkton,Maryland. Well, ON TAP,this is an excellent straightahead IPA! Rich amber color, a fantastic head, and full hoppy flavor but with lots of malt to balance it out! Will have to go back and try the bottles again soon."
Loose Cannon,3.88,"Crystal clear copper with an off white head. Good retention, though no lacing.

Smells like pine sap, pine bark, grapefruit peel, crystal malt, alcohol warmth, pink peppercorn.

Tastes like pine cone, grapefruit peel, ruby red grapefruit flesh, caramel, toasted bread, and lemon zest. Intense pine, a kiss of sweetness, some sweet citrus, and then a biting bitter finish. Very bitter initially, but it does not linger too long.

Medium feel, moderate carbonation, some sticky hop resin sticks on the tongue with the bitterness momentarily, but it does not linger for too long."
Sexual Chocolate,4.5,"Had on tap at the Foothills Brewpub. Pours a deep black color with a thin off white colored head that leaves a little lacing down the glass. Smells of deep roasted malts, hints of chocolate, coffee, and a hint of caramel / brown sugar sweetness at the end. Tastes excellent, nice roasted malt, chocolate taste and a bit of caramel at the end. Smooth, rich, full bodied, perfect amount of carbonation, feels lighter than it is. Overall, this is an excellent rendition of the style and one I would come back to."
Sexual Chocolate,4.18,"Rich dark chocolate flavor balanced on a nicely structured dry malt backbone. Thick, lacey finish."
Sexual Chocolate,3.86,"Dark brown, approaching black, with three fingers of foamy, dark khaki head. Decent retention gives way to thick rings of lacing.

Dry cocoa, umami, a hint of plum and a good whiff of carbon dioxide in the nose.

Bitter baker’s chocolate, plum, roasty umami and toasted malt in the taste. Dark and fairly bitter.

Thin bodied for an imperial stout these days. Lightly creamy (milky?) with fairly strong carbonation.

Nice dark flavors in this one, but with an underwhelming feel and more carbonation off-gassing than I like."
Sexual Chocolate,3.94,"Bought a 22 oz at Kroger's on sale. Sunday afternoon porch lunch with the DW! Some flavors and sharpness that we can't place. It is robust. Really wouldn't say anything chocolate here, though. It is roasty, though. To me, it's an odd stoney taste. Not overly sweet for an imperial. Great color, and the head is beautiful in darkness. A lot of time seemed to go into making this one, though. It is rich and complex in many ways."
Sexual Chocolate,3.79,"Black opaque with a half finger of rusty beige head.

Smells of molasses, dark chocolate, and taffy.

Tastes of taffy, black strap molasses, licorice, and maybe chocolate.

Medium, highly frothy body, with lots of carbonation. Very light feel for the ABV.

I've been waiting for 6 years to try this Jan 2020 version. Very disappointed. It has the name, and a decent mouth feel, but other than that, I'm not really digging it. $16.99 a bottle! I got it in Asheville, NC and am drinking it in Clyde, June 14th, 2020."
Sexual Chocolate,4.39,Had a 2016 (10th anniversary) bomber bottle in April 2020. I thought it was outstanding.
Sexual Chocolate,3.99,"Thin fizzy and cola-like. More coffee flavors that chocolate. Big time roasted malt aftertaste. Not terrible but not living up to it’s style, ABV, or namesake."
Sexual Chocolate,4.21,"Drinking this at Tapped my local tap house in Greenville NC.
Poured from the tap into a tulip glass.
Appears black with a foamy tan head and nice lacing.
Smells chocolatey, malty.
Taste follows the nose. Not too boozy, but I catch a little on the back end.
The mouth feel is thick, and it seems to coat my tongue.
Overall, one of the better Imperials I've had, and I'm not really a fan of higher ABVs. I will definitely order again."
Sexual Chocolate,4.29,"22 ounce bottle in a stemmed stout glass.

Crude oil black in color, opaque, capped with a 2F mocha malted milkshake-like froth. Slow taper leaves a thick film and heavy lacing.

I get the sweet molasses first, then the chocolate and the roast espresso. The dark fruit mixes its way rounding out the aroma.

Chocolatey, toffee, lots of espresso, and heavily malted. The chocolate's infused with dark fruits; cherry, berry, plum. Strong and flavorful.

Full body with a sturdy malt I beam. Sweets, hops, and alcohol match wits. Finishes like a smooth Italian coffee drink.

I prefer to age strong stouts and despite its 75ibu, this was no exception. The strong stuff mellowed and the hops held up well enough. In the end, it turned out nice and drinkable for me."
Sexual Chocolate,4.1,"Had one at a Halloween party last year, was immensely impressed. I am a fan of the stouts and this is killer. Not quite sure about the name and possible connotations so I have not gone back to it yet."
Sexual Chocolate,4.53,"Sampling a cellar temp January 2019 22 oz bottle poured into my snifter. The beer is a part of a trade with @Krubes. Thanks man!
the beer pours jet black in color with a creamy dense tan head of 4 cm foaming up. This is after a slightly aggressive pour. The bubbles start to slowly recede leaving some craters on the surface of the foam. There s well spread windowpane lattice on my glass as the foam drops and after each sip.
Aroma is apparent and fairly bold right from the pour. I get some rich sweet chocolate mixing with a darker more roasty cacao note and roasted malt notes. There is also a bit of sweet brown sugar and some coffee ground. No hop presence and the ABV is actually pretty well hidden on the nose.
First sip reveals a pretty thick body with tingly but spacious carbonation. The texture is smooth but also sticky with a coating on my palate after each swallow.
Flavor is what the nose advertises and what the style promises, with dark chocolate, roasted malt, some brown sugar and coffee grounds and a bit of sweet milk chocolate notes mixed in as well. Pretty complex flavor profile, but still with no hop presence. The booze is also hidden and I find this tasty beer very drinkable.
Very glad to have finally tracked down a trade partner for this one and also glad I have a vintage (2016) and bourbon barrel aged bottle from our deal. Good stuff and worth obtaining if you like big malty stouts!!"
Sexual Chocolate,3.23,"Totally opaque; great.
Nice caramel colored head; great.
A bit gassy; too much I think for a stout; alright.
Smells rich.
The big downside is it's immense bitterness, actually overtaking the flavor. After a number of tastes I get the grain (heavy and rich; great) and the chocolate (bitter as cacao and beautiful). But that first bitterness see the whole stage, unfortunately.

Opinion: if it wasn't imperial, it'd be incredible! If you like heavy imperials, you've a winner here."
Sexual Chocolate,4.7,"Smooth, no head, rich dark chocolate flavors."
Ephraim,4.25,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.

Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.

A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base."
Ephraim,4.67,"Can courtesy of PStone530.
Absolute banger."

Ephraim,4.59,"poured from a 750mL growler into a snifter. pours a semi hazy orange with frothy white head. lacing remains throughout the pour. smell is subtly fruity with a fairly strong butter hop aroma. it’s floral, bitter and fruity all at the same time. taste is dominantly bitter. almost west coast style bitterness but it finishes with more well rounded and balanced fruity finish. mouthfeel is extremely thick, soft and very pleasant on the tongue. might be the highlight of this pour or at least what ties this beer together. very glad to have tried this. very well made IIPA with attributes of both west and east coasts all tied together with HF’s best traits."
Ephraim,4.5,"On tap at Three Penny in Montpelier

Delicious and robust offering from Hill Farmstead that reflects their 'older school' approach to an NEIPA -- big citrus and pine notes that fly off the palate with only a light astringent bitterness on the tail end

90/100"
Ephraim,4.23,"This one pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.

This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.

This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.

I've been waiting to try this one for a long time now. It's not quite the absolute revelation I was hoping for, but I'm still really with it."
Ephraim,4.55,On tap at the Archives
Emperor Julius,4.5,"Pours a turbid orange color with an egg white colored head that is creamy and leaves thick lacing rings down the glass. Magnificent looking hazy, IMHO. The nose is rife with dank ripe oranges and mango, with some pineapple and melon as well.

The taste is focused on the ripe orange and mango flavors, with some melon and pineapple for kicks. There is zero discernible alcohol, quite impressive for an 8.8% ABV beer.

The mouthfeel features that trademark full, pillowy Tree House mouthfeel that keeps reeling you in for another sip. If you enjoy hazies (and I do), Tree House is your Holy Grail. World class stuff, IMHO."
Emperor Julius,4.25,Need ti try it fresh...rated on 2 months old can.
Emperor Julius,4.41,"Canned on: 08-24-22

A - Dark orange gold color with dense, soapy white lacing.

S - Very dank, juicy orange and mango totally dominate the nose (along with some pineapple). In fact, I could smell this beer from two feet away when I poured it!

T - Follows the nose, and nothing but juicy dankness from start to finish. Juicy and pithy orange, mango, fruit rind, pineapple, and passionfruit from start to finish. Finishes on the sweeter side with some underlying citrus bitterness.

M - Thick, pillowy soft, and chewy.

O - Maybe not a perfect 100 but it's high on the impressive list. Go get 'ya some."
Emperor Julius,4.46,"Ever think you've had too many IPA's and then you find one that makes you realize that you haven't tried everything worth having?

Yeah, this was one of those beers.

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.

I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!"
Emperor Julius,4.53,"Look - Great thick orangish color with a big white head and sticky lacing
Smell - mango orange juice but with a bite
Taste - same as smell but w a bigger bite
Feel - thick and creamy
Overall - really great beer but most of the other julius beers are better"
Emperor Julius,4.41,"The body pours a faded orange with a nice fluffy head. Excellent lacing throughout.

Nose is a wonderful hoppy orange, peach and mango. Taste follows nose with the flavor muted a bit compared to aroma. Just enough bitterness to balance the beer, but not bitter as a sister beer like Juice Machine. A nice hop flavor rides the taste to an easy finish.

Very good mouthfeel and carbonation is perfect making this one dangerously drinkable given its ABV, which is felt but not tasted."
Truth,4.35,"Oh man, I’m excited for this one. My last beer from my latest run to Tree House, and one that hasn’t been released in many years. Currently sitting at #84 of all time on BA, we have a straight up, no adjunct barrel aged Stout blend. Let’s crack open this special bottle

Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs

While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin

It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet

So this is very good, but I wouldn't consider it among the best of the best. Regardless, it was super fun to try, and a nice beer to wind down with"
Truth,4.83,"750 ml bottle.

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head. Good retention for the style. Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass. Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer.

The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, and pecans with loads of vanilla, oak, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, light char and a bit of smoke.

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.

The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.

Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup. This bad boy, however, is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have. Fortunately, I didn't pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend.

This is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. The bourbon is certainly present, but doesn't overpower the beer like other BA stouts. It's sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Boozy, but not overly so."
Truth,4.54,"Brewery pour. Appearance was sludge...completely opaque. Hard pour leading to a very small mocha colored head with tiny bubbles. Aroma was dark fruits, toffee, bourbon, caramel and a hint of vanilla. Flavor was as the aroma. Bourbon was a bit more pronounced but didn't over power anything else the beer offered. Layers of flavor and complexity here. Mouthfeel was THICK. Sludgy oil down my gullet. Mouth coating to say the least. Tiny bubbles of carbonation danced on my tongue. Overall, this is an outstanding non adjunct BA offering. Really impressed with this as a non blended barrel aged offering from Tree House. Wish I would've purchased a bottle to take home."
Truth,2.73,"It’s ok, but if I remember right … nothing worthy of a top 50 rating."

Review #2100

Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.

The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.

The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.

Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack."
Truth,4.71,"I’m the resident TH fan but this is damn good! Chocolate, vanilla bourbon & almost everything you’d want from a BA (no adjunk) stout. If I’m picking nits (I am) it doesn’t have quite the flavor pop as something like BBT but does have similar complexity"
Bomb!,4.99,"Simply a perfect beer. First the history- Prairie Bomb! changed the alcohol laws in Oklahoma to open up the door for higher alcohol content beers and a wave of new craft breweries. The complexity is incredible. In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation. Slight bubbles, small head are a delicate balance which is also hard with this style. Appropriately named, this one will sneak up on you. Best beer from the best brewery in Oklahoma. Period."
Bomb!,4.41,"12 oz bottle into a Firestone Walker snifter. 13% ABV. Looks like it was bottled in June 2022, but that’s a guess through a clump of yellow numbers on the bottle neck.
Zero head, get straight to the point I guess.,
Smell is milk chocolate, plum, vanilla.
Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.
Feel is not-quite motor oil thick, a little oily, very low carbonation, but enough to add a little fizzle to the sizzle.
Overall, a real treat. Big Stout!"
Bomb!,4.33,"Burbony smooth style and you can definitely taste the ancho chili, nice little spice at the end."
Bomb!,5,I love this Imperial Stout.
Bomb!,5,I usually shy away from anything this dark. It's very nice!!
Bomb!,4.24,"bottle into glass
Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer. At the very tail end of the finish, there is a bit of coffee, on the palate."
Bomb!,4.06,"Looks rich, not much carbonation from this bottle. Smells sweet and vanilla comes through. Taste is full of each of the advertised flavors - chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a hint of spicy. It feels smooth and thick. Tasty beer."
Bomb!,5,"Damn, if you can find this on draft, TREAT"
Bomb!,3.91,"12 ounce can poured into a 16 ounce glass.

A: Pours an opaque dark brown with a 1 finger medium brown, slightly rocky head. Moderate lacing on the glass upon consuming.

S: Roast barley aroma with overtones of coffee and cocoa.

T: Follows smell with slight added heat from chillies.

F: Viscous, pours smooth over the tongue with a velvety thickness. No burn from the alcohol.

O: A very worthwhile imperial stout, not horrendously expensive. Prairie Artisan knows what they are doing. I'd buy it again."
Bomb!,4.39,"A little sweeter than i hoped for.
Silky mouthfeel
Light ester
As you sip coffee, choclate hits mildly then vanilla and mild spice.
Very nice balance of flavors."
Bomb!,5,"Wow, what do I say about ""Bomb!""? I'm somewhat of an amateur, all I could focus on for this one was the overwhelming spiciness. Beyond that, I definitely taste the coffee and chocolate as the primary flavors. This flavor was very complex, which is why I gave it a 5. I strongly enjoy beers that are ""different,"" and this is nothing like I have ever tasted. Extremely interesting beer, this is about my 6th of the night, and at 13% ABV for this one, I'm pretty gone by now. If you enjoy ""different"" or ""unique"" beers this is for you."
Bomb!,4.29,"Really good stout!!!! I bought a 12 oz. bottle at Half Time Distributors in Poughkeepsie NY, mainly because I am collecting bottle caps from all 50 states and Oklahoma was a real ""find"". I had no idea how really good this beer would be. Pours a totally dense black color with no light coming through. Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane. An excellent stout, I would gladly drink this one again as long as I was not expected to function 100% afterwards!!"
Bomb!,5,Just a perfect Stout. Amazing.
Breakfast Stout,5,A perfect beer?
Breakfast Stout,4.54,"I poured a 12oz. bottle into a 20oz. weizen glass and have ended up with two fingers of beautiful, frothy, dark tan foam. It slowly recedes but does not disappear as advertised! Typical stout look, very dark, one could say black. There is very thick lacing left all the way down the glass as I consume this one.
The aroma is malt first, sweet chocolate, and a little of coffee.
The sip offers a bit of sweetness, then it is quickly covered with the roasted coffee bitter bite and a bit dry to the finish.
There is not an alcohol bite here, but this one is a belly warmer. This is very thick creamy stuff with very light carbonation.
Good stuff, I do not take much time between sips, this one keeps calling me back. Be careful, at 8.3ABV this bowl of oatmeal may sneak up on you!"
Breakfast Stout,4.5,"Yay!! Finally got a chance to taste this one.

Poured a blackish-brown color with a small head that quickly dissipates. The smell was of coffee and chocolate. The taste was of very strong coffee and chocolate, but mostly coffee. Definitely a good morning starter."
Breakfast Stout,4,"Moderately sized head when poured bottle to glass, dissipates but remains at lower levels for some time, creamy appearance and lots of lacing. Beer itself looks like black coffee, no light may be permitted to pass through. Coffee and chocolate present on nose, coffee more so. Sweet bready characterstics as well. In flavor the coffee is much stronger, almost overpowering but not too extreme. Finishes long and remains on lips. Nice and creamy feel, when swishing, movement of liquid is difficult to perceive, almost envelops the tongue. Pretty nice, wish I liked coffee."
Breakfast Stout,4.31,"Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is very good.

Smell: The strong smell of coffee and chocolate dominates the aroma.

Taste: It has a dominant coffee taste with a decent deal of bitterness going down. There are roasted elements as well.

Feel: It has a full body and a good amount of bitterness in the finish.

Overall: This is a great coffee brew."
Breakfast Stout,4.49,"Drank early this morning, and wrote this on a napkin. Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Motor oil brownish-black, with a fluffy and viscous two-finger khaki head. Lacing is excellent.
S - Reminds me of the coffee from Dynamite Roasting. Bittersweet chocolate. Roasted oat.
T - Matches nose, with a bit more complexity. Definite ethanol presence, but the flavor of it never comes through (a good thing). Super toasty. Bittersweet throughout. More coffee-heavy than chocolate-heavy.
F - Thick. Heavy. Full-bodied, with little carbonation (if any). A sipper.
O - Probably not the best idea to have this for breakfast. A prime example for an oatmeal stout. Definitely recommend trying this one, but I won't purchase one again (not too into heavy beers)."
Breakfast Stout,4.68,"Pours almost black with a thick cream colored head that diminishes with time but never disappears.

Aroma of rich coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.

The taste is coffee tempered with a splash of milk and sweetened with dark chocolate just enough to take the edge off on top of a bed of dark roasted grains.

Every sip is rich and full.

Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee. Other coffee stouts often have too little coffee flavor, or sometimes too much, but this one nails the balance."
Breakfast Stout,4.68,"A little bit too sugary and carbonated for my tastes, but a world-class drink nonetheless. It will definitely be my go-to if I'm in the mood for a coffee/oatmeal-style beer."
Breakfast Stout,5,My go to oatmeal stout. Simply amazing.
Breakfast Stout,4.87,"I have chased KBS and CBS for a year now. If I had know how good this beer was, I would have been buying it up instead! Lower ABV, but all of the taste and feel of either of those. A little less complexity, but this is a great beer!"
Breakfast Stout,5,Nothing to add. I am a fan of stouts and this one has zero downsides. Outstanding.
Breakfast Stout,4.47,"12 oz bottle
Glass: snifter
Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)


Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.

Smell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.

Taste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.

Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.

Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act."
Breakfast Stout,4.29,"A - Dark brown / black pour with bubbly, creamy, toffee colored lacing.

S - Big chocolate and coffee roast aroma along with some char.

T - Follows the nose to a ""T"". Coffee roast and chooclate char dominate this beer from start to finish along with some coffee bean and Espresso underneath. Ends with a lingering chocolate coffee char on the back side with some toast cocoa popping up at the very back end.

M - Big medium to full body with just a slight bit of thinness around the edges.

O - This beer continues to be fantastic, not sure what took me so long to review this after drinking it for years. (As I scratch my head.)"
Breakfast Stout,3.87,"L - June 2021 batch poured in January 2022 from a bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50- 55 degrees. 3/4ths of a finger light tan head. The beer is extremely dark and opaque. The head leaves a nice lacing that lasts for longer than most.

S - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell.

T - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.

F - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.

O - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future."
Susan,4.3,"Growler from the source.

Pours hazy gold with an inch-plus head of white. Plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention. Tangerine, peach, and lemon-lime in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Juicy citrus on the palate with minimal malt and a balancing bitterness. Nectarine, peach and pink grapefruit. Finishes dry with a bitter backbone and lingering citrus."
Susan,4.51,"From a single tallboy (brought back from a NE vacation by a buddy), canned 6 weeks ago, into a La fin du monde tulip. If this is what 6 weeks out tastes like, what must it be fresh? Superb construction: gentle but full layers of tangerine, passion fruit, with an incredibly soft mouthful…next to no bitterness, but there is a kind of malty thickness that adds to and also restrains the fruity juiciness.

First beer I’ve ever had a chance to try from HF, and I wish it wasn’t an NEIPA, but even so, damn."
Susan,4.5,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, Vermont for nineteen dollars. My fifteenth brew from these guys. Outstanding."
Susan,4.75,Less complex than the Edward but delicious nonetheless. Very similar with a slightly more alcoholic taste
Susan,4.21,"Nice, restrained and elegant IPA."
Susan,5,What can I say. It's perfect.
Susan,4.49,"Can dated 8/30; best by 9/27:
Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.

That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.

Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.

Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience."
Susan,4.61,"Pours a fairly hazy yellow-light orange. Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works."
Susan,4.46,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.

This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive."
Susan,4.32,"Very, very attractive beer. Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most.

Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer."
Susan,4.5,"Had this beer on tap at the Mule Bar in Winooski, Vermont, just outside of Burlington. Excellent! Another good one that day that is not listed here was called ""William"" and that was superb also. This is obviously a top class brewery, worth visiting the next time we are up here."
Susan,4.49,"Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace

Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix

Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting"
Susan,4.49,"Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs...

L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.
S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.
T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA.
F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely.
O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer."
Susan,4.53,"Canned 6/8/21. Drink by 7/6/21.

L: Pours a deep orange with a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film. Beautiful lacing.

S: Orange, peach, apricot. None of the dirty socks aroma that sometimes comes with Simcoe.

T: Follows the aroma up front, then pivots to grapefruit in the middle. Finishes quite dry with just a slight bitterness.

F: Super soft mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation.

O: An outstanding IPA. The aromas and flavors are subtle but distinct, and the mouthfeel is sublime."
Tank 7,4.45,"Unique beer - Hoppy like a DIPA, looks like a hazy with a very nice head, but lighter like a farmhouse ale. Liked it a lot!"
Tank 7,4.27,The closest thing an American can get to ssison Dupont. Delicious!
Tank 7,4,"Not my favorite, but still very good"
Tank 7,4.35,"Bottle with a best by date of 14-Nov-2022. Pours a somewhat opaque amber-yellow color. Great aroma - yeasty and spicy, pours with a nice, fluffy white head. Taste explodes in the mouth - a bit of lemon, spices and a pleasant hint of yeast. This is an excellent beer - it hides the 8.5% abv pretty well and never feels hot. Taste lingers on the palate in a pleasant way and makes you want more. Excellent!"
Tank 7,4.24,"Generically rated as I haven't had it in awhile, but easily a favorite of mine. Has any eggy yeast taste that leaves me craving more. Personally one of my top 5 favorite."
Tank 7,4.6,One of the best from Boulevard. A surprisingly strong pale.
Tank 7,4.79,"This is my first rating and I’m learning about beer as I go, but I felt compelled to talk about one of my favorites.

Brewed in Kansas City Missouri

Smell of banana with a medium sour aftertaste. Refreshing but also filling."
Tank 7,4.74,From a 16 oz can. Watching reds at home. Crisp full flavor.
Tank 7,4.43,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Color is a pale amber with a two and a half finger head. Decent lacing. Fluffy head like a Coke Float. Hazy, foggy. The fluffy head stays and stays.

S - Yeast front and center on the scent. Sweet and earthy. Some citrus or pear skin as well. Sour scents as well.

T - Taste follows scent. Yeast and sweetness. Like sourdough with sweet cream butter spread across it.

F - Medium to thick mouthfeel with some frothiness.

O - Overall this beer is a treat. Wonderful yeast flavors. I was introduced to Boulevard by a friend from Kansas City, and Tank 7 has been a favorite for years. It’s definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a yeast beer."
Tank 7,4.27,"16oz can with a best by date of 9-17-22. Opened 5-8-22.
Huge meringue like white head that crests over the rim and has amazing retention. Orange-gold, not opaque but close. Tons of visible carbonation. Thick lace. Apricot and lemon nose with some yeast character. Stone fruit, grassy hop bitterness and white pepper (?) spice. Drinkability is high - packs a punch at 8.5%. Medium body with high carbonation. Long, fruity and dry finish. Outstanding."
Tank 7,4.53,"Look: hazy gold, nice white head, good lacing.

Smell: A little banana-y, definitely belgian-y.

Taste: the banana backs off, other eaters still present. Note of cloves. Some malty sweetness as you would expect, followed by a mild lemonish dryness that cleans the palate.

Feel: the fizz is just right, lightens the feel well.

Overall: it is, in fact, an American Saison. It brings in the base flavors of a Saison Dupont, but lightens them, with more emphasis on the hop/citrus."
Tank 7,4.12,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: It has a spicy aroma with coriander and lemon. There are some yeasty and earthly elements as well.

Taste: It has a spicy flavor with a bit of dough and coriander. It has some lemon in the background with some pepper. There are also earthly elements and a bit of yeast as well.

Feel: It has a medium body with a dry finish.

Overall, there are strong spicy flavors with light fruitless in the background and other complex flavors."
Tank 7,4.37,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a long lived tall foamy head and a lot of lacing.

Smells of bread and yeast and cloves.

Tastes of sweet yeasty malt , orange and spices with a slightly dank bitter finish.

Medium body and carbonation. Slightly syrupy and dry mouthfeel.

This brew is a longtime favorite of mine!"
Tank 7,4.67,"Bottle dated 10/7/21

Lovely clear gold with perfect clarity. Stubborn frothy four inch white head; full curtains lacing.

Citrus, yeast, light funk aromas.
Great wine, orange, bready yeast flavors.
Unique flavor combination. Smooth mouthfeel with no alcohol heat. Lasting carbonation.
ABV is too high to drink all day, but wonderful in moderation."
Tank 7,4.4,"While not a perfect traditional version Saison, this beer has become a essential household favorite. I was extremely skeptical at first because my standard for Saisons is high. This beer pours a clear golden into a tulip glass and holds a clean white head, but not too much. Finishes distinctly edgier than that a traditional Saison, but the bittering hops resemble a slightly citrusy and grapefruitlike finish. As an individual and enjoyable beer, I cant find many faults. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It finishes clean and crisp. On occasion during the lakefront summers, I add a splash of lemonade. Of the zillions of beers the Boulevard makes, this is my crown jewels favorite of theirs."
Tank 7,4.21,"Extremely pretty beer. Bright, orangey yellow with a strikingly white head. Nose is Belgian yeast with subtle barnyard notes. In the mouth it's soft at first, with prickly carbonation coming to the fore as the beer sits on the tongue.

There's the usual Saison peppery, funky yeast profile and candy sugar sweetness that dominates at first, with some American hop character following, mainly on the orange/grapefruit side of the spectrum.

Beer finishes dry and peppery.

Very nice beer!"
Tank 7,3.94,"Hazy bright gold with a tower of snow white foam that rings + sheets; challah dough and musty lemon rind with bits of bubblegum, white pepper + flowers; honey on fresh bread, pears, marmalade, a bit of cellar, slight rubber bands + pepper, then herbal, grassy, spicy finish; med, thick, smooth, no heat.

4.25 4 4 3.75 3.75

A good looker, and the nose says a lot: sweet, low on phenols, high on esters, and with a thread of farmhouse.
The taste is as advertised: orchard fruit esters piling onto a pils + candy sugar base (I’m guessing) with not quite enough pepper or clove, but an unexpected hint of earth instead, then a bunch of hop aromas without much bitterness.
This is too sweet, both literally + sensually. The main thing about saison, to me, is the dryness, and regardless of the final gravity, this doesn’t give the impression of finishing dry. You’d never call this “crisp”.
I’ve heard it’s American hops in here; if so, they’re boosting the esters with citrus + other fruit where they shouldn’t be. And the 38 IBUs need to be closer to 45 or even 50.
Don’t get me wrong, the craftsmanship is on point: handsome, burn-free, and goes down easy.
And I read where this is a food beer; I can see that - it *needs* food to cut through all the fruit on show here.
But it’s not what the Belgians call “digestible” - and whatever its other merits, I can’t forgive it that.

I wanted to love this, and it’s tasty, but I didn’t want a second."
Tank 7,4.24,Wonderful
Tank 7,4.35,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a 16 ounce can into a pint glass.
Looks golden orange with a nice dense foamy head that dropped quickly to a thick cap.
Smells yeasty, orange, grapefruit funky.
Taste follows the nose nicely and not boozy at all despite the higher ABV.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall an excellent Saison that I would definitely drink again and will be looking in stores for.
Cheers!"
Tank 7,4.22,"This is GREAT for a saison. A little strong, of course. If you can stand certain IPAs, and love Boulevard's other exceptional releases, then this is for you."
Tank 7,4.23,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $13.99. I purchased this in early February 2021, even though it was from a high-turnover store, and it was canned on 8/19/20 (best by May 2021). So it's over 15 months old. No big deal though as I've had this beer aged and I've had it relatively fresh and it was enjoyable either way.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a frothy, thick, rocky off-white head and a subtle haze. The head slowly subsided to almost nothing, but left behind some nice lacing.

Smell: Very aromatic with notes of citrus - lemon peel and grapefruit pith and zest - along with pepper and funky saison yeast. Smells both hoppy and dry. The nose is also somewhat ""juicy"". Makes me think that it is going to be mouth-watering and refreshing. A bit of alcohol on the nose as it warms.

Taste: Delicious. Amazing that this beer, in a can, has such a long shelf life. It may have lost some of its hoppy aromatic qualities and brightness, but it is still good. While the nose gives the impression that the beer is going to be juicy, this beer is far from it on the palate. Up front, it's slightly sweet and citrusy. There is a grainy, bready maltiness that comes through in spite of the hops. The effervescent beer quickly transitions to its spicy, bitter, extremely dry, grapefruit pithy finish that lingers super long on the palate. It's crazy that this beer is 8.5% ABV. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and I would have believed you if you told me that this is 6.0% ABV. The ""funkiness"" is reserved and I don't get any off those off-putting medicinal flavors that sometimes come along with other farmhouse ales.

Feel: The carbonation is perfect and the body is medium. Nice mouthfeel.

Overall: What a great hoppy American saison. It's awesome that this beer is so good and so accessible, coming from a brewery with such wide distribution as Boulevard. I do think that I prefer this beer when it is fresher. Even still, it is solid and it has developed a different character with a bit of age on it."
Tripel,4.21,"Slightly aged from a mix six pack.
Pours a hazy golden orange with finger of foamy white head.
Aroma slightly yeasty, bready malts, a bit fruity - green apple, banana, spice.
Malty and bready sweetness on the palate with Belgian yeast, banana, spices - limited bitterness.
Brightly carbonated, smooth and a bit sweet - medium mouthfeel - surprisingly light for 8%.
Stands the test as a legend."
Tripel,4.06,"Look: Straw color, I suck at pouring beers so i'm just rating off color

Smell: Smells alright, not amazing but not bad either.

Taste: This is where it shines, this beer tastes almost perfect to me, it's not bitter at all, it's very sweet, I am very surprised.

Feel: Super smooth, not chewy at all, almost water like which I like.

Overall: This is an amazing beer, I highly recommend this to anyone. I've never had another beer of this style but I feel like it would be hard to top."
Tripel,4.33,"Poured from a 75cL bottle best by July 20th 2023

On the pour into my belgian glass, a very nice billowy white 1.5 finger head that actually grows over the rim of the glass over time instead of dissipating until you start drinking. The body is a light gold with a very thick yeasty haze. Some decent lacing.

Aroma carries a very big dose of belgian pale ale yeast character with some light and tart barnyard notes. A light biscuity malt character is hiding behind all the yeast. Not a very hoppy beer.

Taste is very similar to the aroma but the malt shines through extremely nicely. Light malts and some bright fruity and spicy yeast notes. Not very bitter bit there is some bitterness present, but the yeast character balances the malts very nicely.

Feel is big and soft, but drinkable despite the big abv. This beer is pretty dangerously drinkable and smooth. Some warming in the chest from the alcohol but the brightness of it makes this almost refreshing. A nice sunny beer.

Overall this is a very nice tripel, and insanely drinkable for the style, but still carries true to style belgian yeast notes. Quite delicious and even with the big beer, beer beginners seem to enjoy this one as well."
Tripel,4.43,"Sampling a corked and caged 750 ml bottle poured into my chalice. Cage is date stamped best before 4-03-23.
Bottle is at cellar temp and has been in my cellar for a few months.
the beer pours a bright clear golden color with many very active streams of carbonation rising to the surface. A frothy bleached white head of 1 cm foams up on the pour but is a large island that slowly rotates on the surface in my glass.
Aroma is some cloves, green apple, pears, some banana, Belgian yeast bready notes, and hints of a general spiciness. Not really boozy anywhere on the aroma and no hop profile.
First sip reveals a light to medium body with very fine and prickly carbonation. Texture is smooth to a little thinner, not as sticky as I thought it may be.
Flavor is similar to what the nose advertises, with some light fruits: green apple and pear, hints of banana and clove and some general Belgian yeast doughy notes. I dont get any hops. There is some black peppery spiciness that comes through on the finish.
Overall this is a complex Tripel with a nice mix of flavors that all work well together. Glad to have tried this one, enjoying it quite a bit."
Tripel,4.25,"11.2 ounce bottle, poured at 50° into a Weihenstephaner Braupakt chalice - on St. Bernardus Day 2022. “Best by 05/02/24” on the bottle’s label.

Blonde, golden haze, rich foamy head, great lacing. But I had to ding the rating becuz the lace disappeared half way through the experience.
Belgian Ale = Belgian Lace, right?
Smell is sweet and flowery, little bit of spicey corriander, bread, familiar Belgian yeast.
Taste is smooth; fruit, earthy field flowers, slight bitter bite blends well with the sweetness.
Feel is silky, medium carbonation, creamy. Drinks bigger than its 8% ABV, but flattened out toward the end.
Overall, damn nice Tripel that falls short of Trappiste Rochefort’s Tripel, in comparison."
Tripel,5,"A great example of the style.
An easy drinking Tripel."
Tripel,4.05,Citrus and then Belgian malty goodness
Tripel,4.09,"BBE 6/11/23. 33cl bottle to wine glass.

Look: Pours a slightly opaque golden orange with a pillowy, long-lasting head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Some floaters visible.

Smell: Sweet, malty and grassy. Banana and green apple. A bit citrusy.

Taste: Notes of banana, green apple and almond. Malty and sweet. Minimal bitterness.

Feel: Crisp and smooth. Fresh with a medium carbonation.

Overall: Doesn't stick out as much as the Abt 12, but it's still a very good beer. Typical Belgian tripel. Highly drinkable and less alcoholic than many other examples of the style."
Tripel,4.39,"I'm writing a new review of this because I don't think my August 2020 one did it justice.

The appearance is quite hazy but translucent burnt orange, with a soapy white head that condenses down into a small white head with good retention.

The aroma is tart orange peel, orange candy, and hay. Sour, sweet, and citrusy!

Flavors upfront and throughout are heavily orange/citrus-dominant. There's a prevalent barnyard funk and tart sourness that puts this akinly toward lambics. Banana, bubblegum, and doughy malt make are the undercurrent here but they are subtle. Finishes out dry with notes of hay. The tartness lingers.

Fluffy carbonation and pillowy mouthfeel. Feels ample upfront but nothing really lingers; it's clean and dry with effortless drinkability.

A fantastic and unique take on the tripel that moves it more in line with the lambic. Excellent."
Tripel,4.17,"Pours a cloudy, but not completely opaque ange color. Two to three finger sudsy white head forms on the beer. The head settles in and dissipates somewhat, but never fully disappears. A half inch layer of velvety foam remains on the beer and shows excellent retention. Aroma has notes of malt, clove, pepper, spice and some belgian yeast notes. It is not really fruity at all on the nose leaning on the malt and spice notes.

Taste follows the nose with notes of malt, belgian yeast, clove, with subtle notes of apple and banana. Much like the nose, it leans heavily on the spiced notes. There is a certain alcohol warmth to the beer that is more felt than tasted. Feel is light to medium bodied. Smooth and bright. Heavily carbonated.

Overall this is a very nice tripel - I like that it leans more into the spiced notes which seems somewhat unique based on the ones I have had this weekend."
Tripel,4.19,"Appearance: Cloudy gold, tight head.

Smell: Sweetness, clove, yeasty.

Taste: Mild sweetness, then a yeasty mix of cloves, black pepper, and citrus zest.

Overall: Finally revisiting and reviewing St,. Bernardus Tripel. I was big into tripels when I first got into craft beer in the early 2000's. It seemed a logical step up from wheats/wits. This is a classic example of a tripel, and still tastes great."
Tripel,4.08,"A darker dirty straw color, very cloud, big puffy white head with lively carbonation.

A surprising bright and lemon citrus like smell, there is spice hiding behind it and just the slightest bubble gum like banana smell.

The taste surprise too as the notes hiding in the aroma show themselves much more in taste. There is also a graininess to this beer.

Super lively carbonation on the tongue, a semi drying citrus feel on the tongue and a minor grainy like bitterness."
Tripel,4.41,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours a nice opaque orange with LOTS of head. Nose is orange, wheat, honey, marmalade, vanilla, and a nice floral note. The taste is so smooth. Orange creamsicle, honey, yeast, bread, more marmalade, cereal, and a nice light fruity note. Nicely integrated and such as easy drinking beer. Finish is slightly dry and light. Definitely near the top of my list of tripels."
Tripel,4.56,"pours a hazy honeyed amber gold body with cream colored rocky frothy foam head that has high retention and leaves layered sheets of thick suds behind as it settles to a low murky island cap with medium sized halo

aroma is yeasty, wheat sweet, and spice laced. clove and banana and bubblegum galore, batman. white pepper and mellowed fruit; damn-near like smelling an elvis sandwich honestly with a tad bit of creamy nuttiness, bready malt, and melted banana with clove honey

tastes about like an Elvis sandwich. clove honey, loose nutty funkiness tinged bready malt, melted banana fruitiness.

mouthfeel is super high carbonation and lighter-bodied with a slight heft to it. runs pillowed and smooth with a doughy inner layer before finishing bright and semi-dry with a slightly herbal earthy hop laced with serious bubblegum and belgian spiced Elvis sandwich aftertaste

overall:
if an Elvis sandwich is or could be your jam, this brew is adjacent. considering so many mom'n'pop coffee shops around here know me to order an elvis themed drink now and then, and I'm decades in to perfecting that sandwich, I may be a bit biased. not too sweet here, finely balanced in fact. the weird nuttiness is a simple nod after dedicated servers to the melted banana and honeyed malt with belgian spices flaring up galore. ugh. might be my favorite Trip"
Tripel,4.44,"11.2oz'er

Not much clarity, yellow-orange. Smells aigt, tastes better. Lots of bright banana/clove yeast esters, not too sweet either, super easy to drink. Kind of a hit of hard water at the end, not my favorite Belgian but still an undeniable winner"
Tripel,4,"Looks golden brown. Smells of yeast and wheat, also a sweet note. Taste of light malt, and sweet notes of fruit? Overall a great beer."
Tripel,5,One of my top favorite beers for Friday night light body sparkle and lovely sweet and hoppy finish! Cheers!
Tripel,4.45,"Citrus, yeasty, malty pale ale. Very high drinkability"
Tripel,4.24,"I bought the mixed pack of Belgium beers at the LCBO in Ontario.
Poured a 2finger creamy head into glass .
Almost like a wheat beer smooth and we'll balanced flavors in all these beers from the brewery in Belgium I find it amazing that the alcohol is hidden in most of the beers so smooth.
Overall the Tripel refreshing and enjoyable to drink .
I'm glad I bought this mixed pack I should go back for another pack and save it for the summer time .
Cheers"
Tripel,4.43,"Poured into snifter. Opaque pale yellow, persistent white head.

Nose is wheaty, Belgian whit style aroma.

Taste follows. Banana and sweet smooth maltiness.

This is not my favorite style of Belgian ale, but it's very good at what it does. Hits the right notes and drinks well."
Double Sunshine,4.5,"Brewers Notes: This American double India pale ale is packed with juicy tropical fruit flavors and bright herbal aromas, thanks to the abundance of US-grown hops.


College soccer match takes me to within 20 miles of this brewery and gives me the chance to nab this whale

Canned 8.10, opened 9.17, poured into a chilled Spiegelau glass

“Finest freshest”

Fluffy three finger off white foam cap, good retention, settles to a thick puffy island with good lacings over a translucent amber liquid with numerous active carbonation streams

Aroma is orange citrus , whiff of the tropics and some mango

Taste is citrus grapefruit, grapefruit rind

Sudsy mouthfeel , hop bite , we’ll balanced

Good beer , worth the hunt"
Double Sunshine,4.7,"Every super hero has a skill, they have a talent, they have a gift. They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.

Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.

As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.

Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds."
Double Sunshine,4.37,"Canned 8/10/22.

L: Pours a clear orange gold with a big creamy white head that thins on top but sticks around the glass. Lacing is splotchy and irregular but pretty.

S: Surprising juicy fruit aroma, more similar to Sip than expected. A touch of grapefruit and herb.

T: More juicy fruit up front, pivoting to grapefruit in the middle, with a dry and slightly bitter finish. No heat.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation.

O: Combines some of the best elements of new school juiciness and old school clarity and bitterness. Well crafted."
Double Sunshine,4.58,Exceptional! Stopped at their brewery for the first time yesterday. No idea it was even there and turned around. Really glad I did. Tried two short pours as I was driving and tired. I love Sip and this is head and shoulders better in my opinion. It’s right up there with any beer in the country. Well done Lawson’s
Double Sunshine,4.23,Bright citrus with notes of mango and bitter grapefruit.
Double Sunshine,4.47,Pours clear as a lager (or old school IPA). Love that we still have delicious IPAs that are not turbid. Aroma of citrus grapefruit. I’m glad the grapefruit isn’t too much taste-wise. Citrus hops with the grapefruit in the background. Perfect creamy mouthfeel. Great beer.
Double Sunshine,4.36,"Pours a lightly hazy reddish golden with soapy white head. Some overripe mango and expressed grapefruit peel on the nose. A touch of mango but mostly citrus forward. Grapefruit is the central flavor that comes to mind. It's sticky, sappy, chewy. The chewiness of this is really what I'm enjoying the most. I remember this being much more tropical and less citrus forward when I had had it before but those are blurry memories from beer festivals and my palate memory is much more developed now than it was at that time. However, this is still a really nice DIPA that doesn't really have any rough edges."
Double Sunshine,4.84,Outstanding. Better than Heady Topper...but not by much.
Double Sunshine,4.33,"Look - great golden clear color with nice white head and great lacing
Smell - citrus dank herbal
Taste - about the same but dialed back, almost like orange peel with a slight lemon
Feel - medium full body with a medium carb
Overall - really fantastic"
Double Sunshine,4.34,"Small but lasting head. Some streaks for lace. Darker gold color. Clear.

Light earthiness. Some spiciness in the form of nutmeg or cinnamon. Good pale malt base, slightly sweet.

Drier than the smell. The body leans rich but the carbonation is also elevated. The hop bitterness shows up just prior to the swallow. The finish is approaching astringency. The hop is similar To black pepper. The aftertaste draws out some warmth from the alcohol. Surprisingly easy to drink with a good blend of all of the elements throughout the tasting."
Double Sunshine,4.77,"Quick review, can purchased at brewery:
Mostly clear with strong lacing; Nose is a bit light, fruity; taste starts a little sweet, with a hint of burn, but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter. The Transition is nice, only mild complaint is I wish is started just a little less bite. Awesome beer, and I'm mostly finding smaller detractions to bring it down from perfect."
Double Sunshine,4.9,"#67, yummy!"
Double Sunshine,4.41,"I finally got this up in Vermont this summer. I was expecting too much from it based on other people's ratings. I actually prefer SOS to the double. Don't get me wrong, this is a great DIPA, but I am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste I get from SOS. I love how this beer is clear, amber from the delicious malt, well-carbonated, and easy to drink."
Double Sunshine,4.46,"Pours a clear crisp orange-yellow color with a thick but airy white colored head that laces nicely on the way down. Aroma of floral hops, earthy smells and some sweet malts at the end of it. Tastes of toasted malts, nice earthy and slightly citrus hops and a warming alcohol feel at the back end. Thicker feeling than it looks, warming, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, this is what I miss about Double IPAs made in New England."
Double Sunshine,5,Looks great. Tastes great. Feels great. Smells great….. best product from Lawson’s by far.
White,4,"Long review short:
What seperates this wheat beer from all others in the pack is the quality of the ingredients. It feels and tastes like someone cares."
White,4.28,"Bottle from Whole Foods.

A mildly hazy light yellow with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is rich and delicate with a blend of soft grain, light spice with soft clove and a really lovely, delicate citrus note. Delicate yeast notes and soft earth. The palate opens clean and spicy, lightly grainy and with a beautiful citrus note, clean and earthy. Delicate dough on the mid-palate, light wheat, drying on the finish. Crisply carbonated, lovely texture. Brilliant."
White,2.19,"I am not a fan of white beers or wit biers in general so this is a biased review from start. Had it on tap at high-end steakhouse. Good, solid pour with appreciable head. Unfortunately, tasted like other white beers and added nothing new. My opinion on these have not changed"
White,3.84,"Procured in a trade with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in July 2022.

Pours a very pale, almost watery yellow. It has a thin foam rim around the edges and leaves lacing on the glass.

The nose is yeasty, vinous and spicy, with coriander peeking out between the layers. It's what I consider a classic witbier smells like.

Taste closely follows aroma. There's more clove on the palate than picked up in the nose, and the spices really pop once the beer is on the tongue. The finish is quite dry, which immediately makes me want a second sip.

In the mouth, there's a significant carbonic prickle, and it follows the beer down with the swallow. The beer is not particularly high in alcohol but it leaves a warmth in the stomach.

Overall, this is a very tasty beer and could be drunk in significant quantities if desired, especially on a hot day.

Cheers!"
White,4,Pours a very pale yellow. Thin foam. Odd fruity aroma. Spicy clove body. Fades quickly to a fruity clean finish. Good flavor. Not too overwhelming. A great beer for the style.
White,4.3,Outstanding taste and smell. My go-to beer.
White,4.17,"Very classic wheat beer. Taste has notes of bubblegum. Pours a deep golden color. Overall, easy drinking and a perfect example of the style."
White,4.73,A delicious beer anywhere you find it!
White,4.16,"12oz can. Can bottom is stamped 'PACKAGED 5-30-22'.
Cloudy, pale straw colored body. Pillowy white head. Leaves behind webs of lacing.
Aroma of wheat and coriander.
Taste is soft wheat, notes of coriander spice, and a bit of orange citrus.
Medium mouth feel, but soft. Very good carbonation.
Easy drinking wheat beer with orange citrus highlights."
White,4.05,Really nice wheat beer that tastes strongly of coriander with yeast and a bit of orange citrus and slight hops.
White,5,"Wonderful Wit! great notes of banana, and a nice 'belgium finish.' Teriffic beer."
White,3.58,Not good for the price point. Has a very strong bitter aftertastes
4th Anniversary,4.28,4th anniversary re-boot for 8th anniversary.
4th Anniversary,4.09,"Cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense, off-white foam head. Good retention and thick lacing.

Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.

Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.

Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.

Lots of fantastic elements in this. The Playdoh was a huge let down at first, but again, that off-flavor didn’t last too long."
4th Anniversary,4.3,"Holy cow was my reaction to seeing this. It poured very thick. Orange color. 2 finger white head. The head retention is amazing, considering the ABV. Beautiful lacing on the glass.
The nose is well, fairly minimal. Which surprises me. I'm just getting a faint citrus from it. Just a hint of pineapple, and grapefruit. Very minimal.
Taste - Now the taste is another thing all together from the aroma. This is a VERY hoppy beer. There's just a ton of citrus in it. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange - all there. Tons of hops in the flavor.
This beer is thick as heck here, which doesn't surprise me one bit. The hops just cling to my throat, and don't let go at all.
While this beer is light in the aroma department, it more than makes up in every other category. Another damn solid beer from Other Half."
4th Anniversary,4.34,"Poured from a can (2/5) into a Teku

L: solid yellow/tan color, small white head that dissipates after a minute, minimal lacing

S: tons of ripe/overripe fruit (passionfruit, mango, papaya, citrus) with a slight sweet/boozy note, almost creamy

T: everything carries through in a very impressive way. Juicy and smooth, nearly creamy, with the slightest bit of bite at the end and a tiny hint of alcohol

F: soft, smooth, solid

O: just as I remembered, a great triple ipa full of those dank fruit notes I enjoyed"
4th Anniversary,5,Pure perfection. Fruity and juicy. Tasty and simple. Liquid perfection squared. If all OHs beers were this good then the FDA would need to regulate this brewery because it is a highly addictive substance. Thank goodness this beer is not released regularly.
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.32,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.65,"On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.

I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.36,"No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21

Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.

Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.

Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.

A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.46,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.

Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.

Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.49,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date (although I’m pretty sure it’s either B1 or B2). Poured into a Tilquin stemmed glass.

Appearance: A hazy golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass, while leaving some lacing.

Aroma: Funky, barnyard, minerals, light tartness, tropical stone fruit, apricot, unripe berries, green apple, citrus, grapefruit, lemon peel, oak, a touch of grains, with slight pepper notes.

Taste: Tart, tropical and citrus fruity, grapefruit, apricot, green apple, light funk, oak, vinous, with a lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try it fresh, but this bottle having aged 6 / 7 years, has aged gracefully with wonderful complex yet balanced aroma and flavours."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.37,"A bit of a gusher. Pours clear, dark gold with strong effervescence and three fingers of rocky, meringue-like, yellowed head. Decent retention gives way to thick, webbed lacing.

A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma.

Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish.

Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation.

A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.61,"Thank you BartS for this
750 ml bottle poured into a mug

A- A slightly hazy golden straw with a massive white head.

S- Tart, lemons, oak, wheat, some funk, touch of grapes, hints of pears.

T- Sour, lemons, oak, earthy funk, some wheat, grapes, some pears.

M- Smooth, crisp, dry, light body.

O- An excellent and easy to drink Saison, definitely on the sour side but still very well balanced and easy to drink."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.5,Solid representation of oak BA saison
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.49,"Bottle from The Beermongers. Thanks, Sam!

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure.

The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive."
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,4.76,"Bottle picked up from brewery today.
Golden deep copper. Moderate head with lacing. Bubbly.
Bretty tart oaky nose. +Yogurt, vanilla.
Tastes similar to other SARA saisons. Definite tart peach or apricot notes. Tart, lemon, with a little funk. Minerals, yogurt, apples. As expected, more flavors keep showing up as it warms.
Textbook saison body and dry tart finish.
Very nice.
Follow up current batch #11: bought June ‘21. Just amazing saison in every respect."
Anchor Porter,4.72,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful.
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this.
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this.
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone.
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be."
Anchor Porter,4.46,Tasty
Anchor Porter,4.5,"Pours into hotel plastic cup like a stout, frothy tan head
Big tastes of coffee, chocolate and toffee/caramel for being light in abv. Finishes slightly dry. Delicious Union Made Beer to celebrate Labor Day"
Anchor Porter,4.21,"Pours a very dark brownish color with a dark tan head. Smell is of chocolate and coffee, caramel, and malt. Taste is a nice chocolate-coffee and caramel. Good tasting Porter."
Anchor Porter,4.17,The Porter is a dark beer and I got a two finger mocha head in a nonic. The roasty chocolate smell is inviting. The taste is roasty and finishes bitter. The solid mouthfeel bites back with the lingering bitterness. Overall an enjoyable porter.
Anchor Porter,4.17,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown with
a very nice head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thin clumping layer,
and shows off some nice lacing. Nose of dark coffee, dark cocoa, moderate char,
and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. Flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes
of black and raspberry, dark cocoa, dark coffee, char, and balanced sweet
caramel malts. Nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium,
smooth, lightly coating, light carbonation, and a balanced char and roast finish
that is lightly dry.

Overall---EXCELLENCE!

Cheers"
Anchor Porter,4.15,"Opened this fresh 12 ouncer and drank it straight from the bottle.
This is a superb everyday Porter, richly delicious, tastes of coffee, mild chocolate, dark malt. Drinks light. Finishes crisp. Excellent American display of the style."
Anchor Porter,4.54,"Delightful dark roast coffee flavors with a hint of chocolate. Crisp, light, and ultimately refreshing.
About as good a porter as any I've tried."
Anchor Porter,3.9,A true American classic. This porter is quite a treat bursting with caramel and chocolate notes. A deep brown dark chocolate color with a nice white-brown head is magnificent. Raise to your nose and you are met with roasted aromas and the beer tastes malty and smooth like melted dark chocolate. A great beer reminiscent of a mocha coffee.
Anchor Porter,2.11,"From the rear label: ""PKG050521""

Appearance: It has a black body with a large, thick, khaki head. The head has a creamy texture on top with shallow lumps and ripples across its surface. Head retention is good and as it slowly recedes it leaves a nice sheet of thick cobweb lacing with large round gaps in the sheeting. It looks exactly like you would picture a Porter in a magazine.

Aroma: There isn't much going on in the aroma here. It has a bit of a phenolic, rubbery scent. As the beer sits there is a scent of nail polish. Very odd aromas.

Taste: Up front there is nail polish and a bit of toasted caramel. Towards the middle the nail polish character comes through even stronger. There is a pleasant note of coffee and faint burnt carbon. The nail polish character really kills the other flavors.

Mouthfeel: There is a medium roasted grain bitterness to the beer and a body that rests on the upper edge of medium. Carbonation feels fine. Drinkability is low given the flavor and aromas.

Overall: A very disappointing beer. The off-flavors in this beer really hamper any positive characters that might have a chance at getting out. I wouldn't recommend this beer. I wouldn't buy it again unless I could try it directly from the brewery to see if it was an issue with the batch, the packaging, or if the recipe is consistently like this."
Anchor Porter,4.65,"Black with a tan head, excellent retention and lace
Dark chocolate, some char, a hint of licorice and dried fruit.
Much more char on the palate, dried fruit, licorice, the darkest chocolate you've ever had, lingering finish
Medium-heavy body and appropriate carbonation
Surprised I hadn't reviewed this one yet, it's an old favorite."
Anchor Porter,4.13,"Serving: 12 oz bottle (“PKG090821”) poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.

Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown with a healthy head of tan foam and sticky lace.

Smell: Rich aromas of cocoa, espresso, dark roasted malt and hints of caramel.

Taste: Dark malt and hops, leaning more towards roasted grains, coffee, earthy minerals and crisp bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with lively carbonation.

Overall: Both bright and dark, well hopped and deeply, roasted malt."
Anchor Porter,3.63,Pours very dark. Dark foam. Chocolate aroma. Dry hop body. Chocolate and coffee are present. Fades to a deep roasted malt finish. A little too much carbonation. It takes away from the flavor. Otherwise pretty good.
Anchor Porter,4.4,"Poured into shaker pint. Beautiful chocolate cream head that drops to a ring, with a big patch of lace. Beer is cola and opaque.

Nose is on the creamy side, with some dark fruit.

Taste is sweet and creamy with chocolaty malt and mildly bitter note

Good carbonation on a medium body. Mild bitter finish.

This was one of my first craftier beers. Still great. ""Beer that tastes like beer."" - guy at the liquor store"
Anchor Porter,4.14,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled 5/5/21.

L---Darkest brown color with a big, khaki head that had very good retention and left very nice lacing.

S---Both milk and dark chocolate. Caramel.

T---Milk chocolate moreso than the still present dark. Caramel. Very, very light on the advertised coffee (is 4 months too old for a porter?).

F---Feels bigger than 5.6% ABV. A little bit more than medium body with good carbonation.

O---A really nice one."

Anchor Porter,4.2,"Bottled 2/23/21

Yet again, how have I not yet tried this beer? An absolute classic, especially amongst the early craft beers. From what I have read before, I was under the assumption that this was actually an English Porter, which I tend to enjoy a little bit more than their harsher American counterparts. Anyways, I’m excited to finally try this, no matter what it is

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here strikes a balance I really like between burnt bread and sweeter malt. I’m picking up on aromas of roasted barley, dark bread, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate malt, and very mild earthy hops

A slightly less delicate balance is achieved in taste, leaning more into the bitter and roasty side of things. As I said, this is not particularly my preference, but it is well done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark roast coffee, roasted barley, herbal hops, dark chocolate, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark bread, doughy malt, light raisin, herbal hops, and milk chocolate

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a biting yet smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slowly expanding sweetness

This is crafted beautifully. While not the most impressive porter I’ve had, the execution is just incredible. I need to get this more often"
Anchor Porter,4.4,"Dark brown with a foamy tan head. Aroma of dark malts; cocoa, chocolate, coffee, nut, caramel. Nice dry Porter flavor. Slight bitterness. Finishes really clean. Nice medium body. A delicious example of a Porter."
Anchor Porter,4.33,"Stamped code on back reads PK GO 041620
Tan head above a deep. dark brown but clear beer. The head slumps quickly to a ring and film.
A swirl kicks up the foam and allows the sweet charred grain aromas out. Molasses and maple, campfire and singed spruce tips.
Rich flavors of grilled cherries and leather, scorched sugar and red wine tannins. Just on the edge of sour notes move in mid swallow, slightly astringent bite at the back. Sweet and dry the hops lend a firm bitterness to the smokey malt base.
Body is light - medium - rich in flavor not heavy in body.
A classic Porter bordering on robust. Obviously not a fresh bottle yet still more than enjoyable."
Anchor Porter,4.38,"(355 ml bottle). Pours with a large tan head, colour is very dark, nearly black (= very, very dark ruby when held to the light). Lovely complex aroma where coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, oak and sandalwood shine through. Flavour is initially sweet and mellow, then a distinct bitterness comes through. Coffee notes are dominant. There's something undefined strange in the aftertaste that keeps me from giving it a straight ""5"". Still, this is a top class porter!"
Anchor Porter,4.25,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I have not reviewed this before, have had many times, looking forward to getting again soon."
All Day IPA,3.89,Shockingly good mouthfeel/body for a beer under 5%
All Day IPA,4.3,"Nice and easy IPA. Alot of flavor, but not much! Nice beer for sitting back and relaxing. Great beer!"
All Day IPA,3.92,"Pours a golden color with a decent white head.
The smell is of hops and some citrus.
Taste is of citrus and hops.
Overall, this is a good IPA to have in your refrigerator."
All Day IPA,3.33,"An above average light beer. Lots of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er. Hard to rate, because there isn't anything ""wrong"" with it, but it's not special in any regard. Piney bitter, little (to no) sweetness. Again, there's a noticeable amount of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er."
All Day IPA,3.65,"There’s a ‘little bit’ of everything a session IPA should have, but not a damn thing that distinguishes it from the rest of the pack.
Session beers? Drink Local!"
All Day IPA,3.98,"Aroma is malt,citrus,pine,a little earthy and floral
Taste for the most part follows the aroma.
As advertised its a great session beer"
All Day IPA,3.93,"Everyone else has it pretty much covered. For what I’ll say, there’s quite a lot of additions here to bolster up the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. Flaked corn, wheat, barley, oats. Definitely comes through in the body and finish, body is thicker than any beer at 4.7% should be, crisp finish. Excellent malty, grainy, aftertaste with the weight of a medium bodied beer, despite the beer being a little more sessionable than a full medium-heavy bodied beer . Not particularly bitter, though my tastebuds might be hop fried these days. Founders knows what they’re doing. It’s not unbelievably complex and yet, for a session beer, it also kind of is. Very pleasant stuff."
All Day IPA,4.37,"Yields a slightly clouded golden amber color with a huge, spongy head.

Smells of ripe oranges, papaya and spicy garden herbs among lighter blueberries and fresh cut limes.

Has an utmost refreshing and light mouthfeel to it, due to its well balanced body and fitting, prominent effervescence.

Tastes of malty, slightly resinous caramel among headstrong, bitter hops, leading with unpretentious limes, as well as more subtle exotic fruits. Offers a pleasant bready middle part, with even more pronounced bitter limes, creating an intriguing, yet easy to comprehend and well working interplay. Finishes with a bit more luscious oranges and papaya among rustic bread rind, a note of resin and long lasting, finish defining bitter limes.

This is great! Such a refreshing, perfectly balanced low abv beer with a satisfying complexity is hard to find."
All Day IPA,3.54,"You’ve read the reviews. You’ve read the tasting and smelling notes. All you need to know, is that this should be your go to session beer. Happy 4th!"
All Day IPA,3.93,"Clear light amber color with a moderate ivory head that sticks around fairly well and produces some nice lacing.
The aroma is light sweet malt with citrus and a touch of pine.
The taste is likewise grapefruit, tangerine, light malt with a dry lingering grapefruit pulp and pine resin finish.
The body is medium, fairly smooth, good carbonation, very drinkable.
Altogether this brew is, as advertised, an excellent session brew, especially during warm weather, light and refreshing, enjoy."
All Day IPA,3.83,May-22
All Day IPA,4.5,"OMG, why have I waited so long to try this beer. Its been out for several years now and it's still the best sessionable IPA I've ever had. Mouth feel is crisp, refreshing, and carbonated. Taste is that of an old school WC IPA, hoppy, malty, with a little pine. This beer is great for day drinking. I'll be keeping my fridge stocked with these guys this summer."

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not sure what happened to the review I already did but at the end of it I said that this was my favorite session IPA. Let's see if that stands the test of time. It's poured a lightly hazy deep gold body beneath a full head of slightly off-white foam. The aroma is citrusy and piney over a delicate and lightly bready malt base. On to the taste... it's basically the same. The malt is lightly sweet, bready, grainy, and biscuity. The hops deliver notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and pine. There's a light touch of hop resin to it as well. The bitterness clocks in at 42 IBUs balancing it and bringing it to a dry, bitter finish with some citrus pith and pine lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The head held up pretty well and it's left some nice lacing about the glass. In my opinion this is very much a pale ale with extra hops and that's fine with me. It's 4.7% ABV which is .3% below Budweiser (at least in the U.S.), and 140 calories. I've had multiple servings of this over the course of a day (COVID lockdown!) and I can truly say that it continues to deliver. Now, are there pale ales out there that could do the same thing? Of course there are, but this is an easy go to. If you haven't had it I suggest you try it.

All Day IPA,3.88,"Had this from a bottle.
A: pours an orange body with small white head with ok retention and lacing.
S: sweet, earthy grapefruit smell with some sweet undertones
T: a grapefruit, hoppy tasting beer; a nice malt taste
M: medium bodied and pretty smooth; fairly crisp
D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking beer overall"
All Day IPA,4.65,"It’s not exciting, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s fresh, bright, crisp, refreshing, low alcohol, everything it should be. I gave the look a 5 not necessarily for the beer, but the art work on the can. One of my favorite beers of all time."
All Day IPA,3.84,"Look - poured into a 5 oz tasting glass. dark golden in color, slightly hazy, with not much head but moderate lacing.

Smell - a balance of citrus (both orange and grapefruit) and pine on the nose, along with a bit of sweet malty fragrance.

Taste - light on the palate. moderately hopped with a robust malty backbone that balances well. citrusy hops are detectable on the tongue, but focus is more on flavor rather than bitterness. finish is smooth with lingering hoppy fragrances.

Feel - light bodied, average carbonation, and low ABV at 4.7%.

Overall - this beer is everything as advertised: a sessionable, good tasting IPA that is easy to drink and easily enjoyable by anyone."
All Day IPA,4.6,It lives up to its claims and available moderately priced at my local grocery store.
All Day IPA,3.95,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a glass.
The All Day IPA has a nice golden amber color with a good head.
Citrusy aroma, including orange and tangerine with a touch of grapefruit.
The grapefruit and orange flavors come through nicely, but after each sip you're left with an astringent dryness on your tongue.
Light to medium body, perfect for a session beer
It's drinkable, but after one or two the astringency definitely has me wanting to switch to something else."
All Day IPA,4.35,"Nice mid-hopped moderate ABV IPA. It's called a Session IPA for a reason. Satisfies the IPA hoppiness without blowing you away with bitterness. Purchase 15-pack of cans from Foundry Wines & Spritis in Owings Mills, MD."
All Day IPA,3.56,"Bottle to pint glass. Bottled 9/1/2021.

L: Clear, copper colored, moderate head with good lacing.
S: Pretty light, mostly grassy/floral hops.
T: Stronger version of the smell; light hop flavors, nothing too overpowering.
F: Dry, a little resiny.
O: Nothing extraordinary but a good beer for sessioning at the bar or in the backyard."
All Day IPA,3.81,"Sweet floral and citrus on the pour, medium sharp tang on the tongue that settles into a slightly-bitter pinewood taste. Subtle malt flavor in the background. A nice step up from an APA for the recent hops voyagers out there, and a decent ""all day"" for the rest of us."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.79,"Look: black with a thin mocha head

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak

It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed

Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very good"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.43,"2022 version on draft.
Very solid offering.
Balanced + creamy for the amount of booze and adjuncts it has.
Still could only stomach 6oz worth."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.54,2018 Vintage on 12/24/2021
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.33,"2017 limited release Coffee Cinnamon Barrel Aged B-Bomb, imperial winter ale. Aged (4 years? or nearly 5?) in my cellar and served chilled in a Chimay chalice. Oil slick appearance and a big warm cinnamon nose that fills the room. Really that aroma is hard to beat. Flavor is creamy and mouth-encompassing with waves of caramel, cinnamon candy. Ultra-fine carbonation adds milkiness to the mouthfeel. Mocha and coffee flavors are initially mellowed but there's a more pronounced coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Vanilla flavors from the bourbon are also mellow, and I don't get any harsh whisky flavor at all. Pretty amazing for 13.0% ABV. World-Class absolutely describes it. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but I have no regrets about aging it this long."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.53,"2019 Vintage

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.

Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side.

Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.

Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.68,"2019 version, aged at Fremont purchased through Tavour. My second version of B-bomb, but I haven't had the base beer yet.

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.

Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.

Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.

Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.4,"Pours a dark brown with tan head. Coffee, cinnamon, a little pepper on the nose. Tons of chocolate, some faded coffee notes, and cinnamon spice. There is a light heat from the bourbon barrels. It's so smooth, quite thick in its mouthfeel. In spite of the ABV and the weight of this beer, it's still a beer you want to keep sipping on."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.4,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that has excellent retention properties and hardly died down.
S: Light to moderate aromas of bourbon, coffee and cinnamon are present in the nose, the latter of which becomes stronger as the beer warms up.
T: The taste follows the smell and has additional notes of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging. No alcohol is perceptible.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The cinnamon lends hints of heat in the finish.
O: This beer does a very good job at balancing all of the flavors together and is exceptionally easy to drink considering its strength.

L -- Black with a small khaki-hued head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention and some lacing
S -- Cinnamon, smokey oak, caramel, dark chocolate, bourbon, herbal bitters, hint of ground coffee
T -- Despite the two years of aging on this one, the coffee and cinnamon character are both there and round out the soft bourbon barrel notes very nicely. No angles are too harsh here. Also getting dark chocolate, vanilla nougat, herbal hop
F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium- carb. Not overly boozy or bitter

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.92,"2019
Appearance: impenetrable dark mahogany color tending to black, creamy beige foam with excellent persistence. Flawless.
Smell: cinnamon, caramel, chocolate, coffee, leather, vanilla, wood, bourbon. Elegance and balance.
Taste: molasses and caramel, chocolate, cinnamon, roasted notes of coffee and malt, vanilla, hints of wood, leather, tobacco, bourbon. Aftertaste of Christmas cake with chocolate and coffee sprinkled with cinnamon.
Feeling: cinnamon pleasantly pinches a round and velvety drink constantly embraced by a gentle ethyl heat of bourbon. A disarming balance between sweetness and bitterness. An elegant aging in barrels.
Body: full but not bulky nor chewable, round and soft, medium and fine carbonation."
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.5,"Poured from a bottle (2017 vintage) into a small tasting glass

L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does

S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat

T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot

F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?)

O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style). Solid nose, great flavor - some age in the bottle has muted the adjuncts but I’d say they still come through well"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.65,"A: black pour, almost stout-like. Includes a very dark head to boot. Head dissipates quickly like most barrel aged brews.

S: cinnamon and lots of it. Bit of sugary caramel from the barrel.

T: wow! Again, loads of cinnamon both in flavor and in heat. I don't taste the coconut so much as feel it, it adds a lot of richness to the brew and leaves an oily, coconutty film after every sip. Bourbon barrel adds a lot of sweetness which balances everything out.

M: thick, heavy and oily

O: this is one hell of a winter warmer. The typical flavors are complimented and enhanced with the additions. This is an incredibly rich and sweet dessert beer, make no mistake. Startlingly good beer, one of the best I've had in a long while"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,4.43,"2017 vintage consumed in early 2021. Dark brown/black pour, not much head. Three and a half years down the road from brewing, the coffee flavor is almost undetectable. Cinnamon dances with oak and bourbon flavors to provide nice complexity. As the beer warms, the bourbon flavoring increases, overwhelming nuance, but that's quibbling. This is a world-class effort!"
Keene Idea,4.44,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew."
Keene Idea,3.75,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ."
Keene Idea,4.28,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

Cheers!"
Keene Idea,4.78,"Pours golden in color with a nice head that leaves a beautiful lacing. The nose is slightly sweet, almost honey like hint but a bitterness added. Taste is bitter that quickly goes away with a dry finish. Superb beer."
Keene Idea,4.02,"Nearly clear amber brew with plenty of foam in the fat wheat beer glass. Lush with creamy carbonation. Malty and medium sweet. Aromatic with citrus and papaya. Taste is candied bitter orange, or marmalade. Very sippable and well made.

Hops are listed at Citra, Southern Cross, Nelson, and Pacific Jade. This DIPA bears the extra alcohol and malt well. A little of a hop overdose as you might expect. I have not had an Alpine beer in years so was happy to try one I had not seen. Brewed in San Diego. From the 16 oz can dated 10/25/21."

Headroom,4.67,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top.

S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime.

T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly.

M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard.

O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.58,A rice ipa. Super clear golden. Looks like a budweiser but with a nice lacing. Smooth slightly sweet. Kuhnhenn call it west coast ipa but the high ABV and sweetness covers up much of the bitterness. Very good but not a classic west coast. Reminds me of a Founders Hopslam. Tender says they get that comparison often but that Kuhnhenn came out with the DRIPA five years before Founders figured it out!
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.01,"12 oz can from Tavour. Hazy golden pour, fizzy head. Aroma is hoppy and lghtly fruity. Taste brings smooth malts with a huge hoppy bite. Light orange, minimally sweet. Bitterness stays on the palate. Sublime, smooth and strong."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.17,"Appearance – This is a very hazy dull yellow with a nice off-white head that dissipated rather quickly.

Smell – The big lemon stands out in this unsweetened fruit nose. Lots of citrus and a bit of straw.

Taste – More lemon at the taste and a bit of malts that were hard to find at the nose. The hops are resiny with a hint of pine and very little sweetness.

Mouthfeel – This is medium-bodied and extremely dry. The dryness is massive at the finish, probably too much for the uninitiated.

Drinkability – Good thing the bitterness slows you down because at nearly 10% ABV it is a heavy hitter."

DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.26,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a fine, three finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of pale and biscuit malt, citrus and mildly dank hops, lemon, grapefruit. Flavor is pale, mildly biscuit malt, citrus and piney hops with a bit of dankness, lemon, grapefruit, vague stone fruit. Hop bitterness slowly builds into a nice citrus rind and resinous finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Wasn't sure what to expect here (rice is a craft bugaboo) and this starts off deceptively simple, but builds in both hop intensity and bitterness as well as revealing light, not easily identifiable, but interesting fruit flavors. The dominant fruit is citrus, mostly lemon, but there are other wisps of fruit like expected in a hazy. The body is excellent, better than I expected from rice; I'd have guessed a little oats in a blind tasted. Light, crisp IPAs are not my style, but I really like this and always appreciate a beer that starts subtle and then delivers a burst of flavor. Nicely done."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.26,"12 oz can

Aroma is of fresh grassy malts, lemongrass, citrus, and cracker.

Flavor is of rich piney hop, sweet rice malt, cereals, hints of citrus, and some honey.

Medium to full body, mild tingly carbonation.

Really tasty and flavorful IPA. The addition of rice malt to the flavor is a very nice balance to the piney hops. Very easy to like and hope to have this again."

12oz can served in a snifter. May 1519 is on the bottom of the can.

Pours a clear yellow with slight amber tint, smallish head, medium to low carbonation. Smell is lemon, grass, and dough (so, probably yeast).

Taste is quite lemony, it's grainy in an unfamiliar way, which is probably due to the rice. The odd graininess dominates the finish.

Mouthfeel is fairly thick, fairly still. Overall, good beer."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.44,Pours a cloudly golden color with a foamy head that disappears quickly. Aroma of tropical fruit and grapefruit. Taste mirrors the aroma. Tropical fruit to start and tart grapefruit to finish. Some hoppy bitterness noted. An interesting brew because of the use of rice.
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.23,"12 oz can sent from superspak, poured into a Stella Artois chalice. Can date is JAN1719 (1/17/19).

Pours a gorgeous slightly juicy, slightly hazy golden glow, with a tall cap resembling shaving cream of 3 fingers. It recedes fairly quickly but not like, before your eyes or anything, to a 1/2 finger. Nice rings and stretches of lace left behind. Alcohol legs, too.

A huge hit of pineapple in the nose, followed by tangerine and sticky resins. With agitation, I get grain alcohol and cantaloupe, the graininess is a different shade than I'm used to, which can easily be attributed to the long grain rice.

Flavor brings herbal and mint notes, with slight lemongrass, a nice hit of pomelo, some tangerine and faint white peach, some black tea, and a good amount of astringent grain and grain alcohol. It's unique but throttles the flavor full blast.

Feel is thick and hot, some moderate to high busy carbonation, a resiny, oily finish with more alcohol heat that settles in the belly like a hive of angry bees.

Overall a very delicious, well-crafted, artisan Double India Pale Ale that doesn't bow to any trend and does its own thing completely. And boy it does it proud. Highly recommend to any beer drinker to try this one AT LEAST once. I'll probably be pawing for more eventually."

DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),5,Outstanding!
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),3.86,"Appearance is practically perfect in every way. Smell is old school IPA ideal: piney, dank, etc. Taste follows smell, first two drinks are heavenly. Third swallow finishes warm and boozy and that’s where this beer falters. Dial down the 9.5% on this one in order to hook me for the long run. Everything else is there and this one is certainly enjoyable, but the booziness and heat are distracting deeper into the pint."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.33,"Pours an amazingly bright straw yellow with an ample white head that is lacy and persistent. Visible carbonation and a slight chill haze.
Smell is bright lemony peachy goodness. Very little maltiness/breadiness, some sweet honey notes play with the peachy ones.
Taste is nicely balanced between a sharp lemon peel bitter and a light melon like sweetness. Grassy/herbal notes mingle in the middle and finishes very clean. Very little malt presence
Mouthfeel is remarkable for it's lightness. The body on this thing is more akin to many a lager as opposed to a double IPA. Hard to rate it fairly because it's not in line with most in the style but i wouldn't call it a flaw. I like it's lightness but just know that it is a very crisp beer that treads very lightly across the palate.
Overall this is a stupendous beer. So glad to see it in cans now and hope I can keep a semisteady supply in my fridge from a distance. Light body, great balance of citrus bitterness, light fruity sweetness, and complex herbals in the flavor. Drink this beer"
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.24,"Pours near transparent straw, copious head of med-large bubbles. Nose is sake, grass, white grape. Taste is grainy but smooth, herbal and white wine notes, along with some yeast notes. Mouthfeel is medium and satisfying with the nice carb. No heat, surprising given the abv. This beer could be dangerous. Overall this is a nice concept that's really well executed."
DRIPA (Double Rice IPA),4.35,"A very bright, crisp take on a classic West coast DIPA. Poured from a can, it presents a light, hazy golden color with a full finger of head. Pomelo and grapefruit pith all over it, with some modest resin and pine notes. The rice provides a balancing sweetness that is very subtle in the mid-palate, lurking underneath the other bolder flavors, but it also produces a sake-like, long finish that is a pleasing intermediary between dry and sweet."

Houblon Chouffe,4.37,"I'm re-reviewing this as the last time I was in a hotel and the fridge didn't really work, so it was a bit too warm...now it's at the perfect temperature and I'm not in a hotel ; )

Cool and unique bottle...amazing design and not too serious like some others, and not as silly as Delerium Tremens with pink elephants ; ) In my wine glass, it shines brightly and the head is nearly perfect.

Heavenly aroma, but it disappears fast after pouring. Belgian malt fused with West coast style hops, is it the best of both worlds, or the destruction of each?

This is my fourth beer review of the day, and this is the best for sure. And the others were mostly Belgian, one was French. Flavour is well balanced, but lacks uniqueness. Hops are super dry, which I love. And the overall feel is far superiour to every beer that isn't Belgian, probably.

It's amazing. So what is it missing? Just a little more apricotty fruitness would be great...such as the Duvel Equinox. Or many West Coast IPA's. It's amazing but doesn't have the next dimension ; ) And it's definitely better chilled to around 2 to 4 centigrade, in the fridge. Myself I am drinking at 1 centigrade, so that the flavours change as I write this review and I get the greatest possible experience, as my room is warm ; )"
Houblon Chouffe,3.94,"330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 11/2020, so well late on this one. Let's see what happens...

Decent look on the glass. Slightly hazy yellow with amber highlights body. Small white head shrinks to a thick ring and covering, scattered lacing.

Mildly fruity aroma.

On tasting, there is a fair amount going . It's a quite drying drink. A little non citrus fruit. Spice bitterness. The blend is quite pleasing.

Mouth medium, finish drying.

Overall, despite the age, not a bad drink. The abv is quite well hidden. Now curious to try a fresh bottle to see the difference."
Houblon Chouffe,4.99,"Slightly hazy gold, generous white head, excellent retention and rings of lace
Lots going on in the nose: apricot, orange, a touch of banana, a hint of sea air, pepper, clove, a little herbal
Very herbal upfront, then soft fruit building into grapefruit, spicy, bitter finish that lingers
Medium-light bodied, clean, and well carbonated
Been years since I had this, forgot how awesome it is. Going to have to work it into normal rotation"
Houblon Chouffe,4.56,"This IPA does everything right. Everything is in balance. Clean, clear and friendly. The bitterness is well spread out across the dimensions of body, carbonation, slip and familiarity.
Packaging: I don't like squat bottles, but this is a small price to pay for such a great content. Outer 4-pack cardboard is definitely created by gnomes."
Houblon Chouffe,4.34,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy (~35% opaque) pale yellow-orange color with a massive white head. SRM of 9. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of fruity hops including citrus, pear, apple, and stone fruit. Strong fruit mixes with Belgian esters of juicy fruit, coriander, and Belgian spices. Some bread malts within.

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange and tangerine citrus, pear, and stonefruit. Then it mixes with teh juicyfruit and Belgian esters in the middle with some year. A smooth bread malt finish. A pretty dry and yeasty finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation and yeast to finish bubbly, yeasty, yet dry enough and clean on the palate. (4.50)

Compared to Boulevard Tank 7 3/12/22: Pours a hazier color. More citrus notes. Less strong Belgian esters. Cleaner on the palate.

Overall: A fantastic Belgian IPA. Nails the citrus and tangerine notes with just enough Belgian esters to balance it out. I usually find Belgian IPAs confusing and too much going on but this one balances the flavors perfectly. Yet, what is so impressive about this beer though is the carbonation, delicate Belgian yeast notes with the dry body. I am amazed at how this one hides the 9% ABV. You would never guess. Crafted to perfection. (Final Rating: 4.34)"
Houblon Chouffe,3.67,"Big foam in the Pilsner glass, takes quite awhile to get a sip out of the stuff. Very persistent foam on the clear golden amber brew. I think of the Belgian candy flavor which is here intensified by the alcohol. I call this sort of thing a hop liqueur. Flavors are more herbal than fruity, except for the estery dried pear taste of so many Tripels.

Looking back at my review of the Piraat Belgian IPA with it's own load of esters, I wished for a ""fresh, crunchy baguette to go with it."" Ditto. This is one of the more distinctive beers you could drink. Very bitter, though, with all the yeast piling on the hops. Another example of the remarkable flavors that hops and yeast can create. From the handsome and unique brown 330 ml bottle; wish you could re-fill these. ""Best before 10 2022."""
Houblon Chouffe,3.69,"A bottle poured into a pint glass. Pour had a floofy white foam head and a hazy pale straw body. Scent is pretty muted; notes of spice, grassy fields and sweetness from the high ABV are present, but not much else. Taste has more of the spiced hop and grassiness and a notable hoppy bitterness coming through. Some minor malty sweetness helps to round out the taste. Feel is on the medium side, surprisingly unencumbered by the 9% ABV, and leaves a rather spice/grassy hop aftertaste."
Houblon Chouffe,4.25,"Looks Hazy golden, Had a fluffy head. Smells very hoppy and of yeast. Feels nice. I enjoyed this Belgian IPA."
Houblon Chouffe,3.94,"L: Slighty hazy golden ale. Generous frothy head that sits like a fluffy cloud atop the beer. Very appealing looking.
S: Yeasty, spicy (pepper and floral) with a faint citrus.
T: The spicy, peppery yeast finishes with a dry, citrus hops taste.
F: Dry and some puckering.
O: This has all the characteristics of a fine Belgian ale. The dry and spicy yeast play center stage. The hops are understated but support the yeasty backbone. The booziness comes through."
Houblon Chouffe,4.17,"A 355ml bottle poured into a pint glass. A two finger fluffy white head on a hazy lemon. The head sticks around to the end with lots of lacing.
Mild hop aromas. Some spice.
Sweet malts. Fruit in the middle. A very mild hop finish.
Medium body and carbonation.
Very mild hops for an IPA. It's more like a hoppy triple. Smooth and well balanced."
Houblon Chouffe,3.89,"L- Good fine Santa beard white foam creates full drapes as it slides down the glass. Beer is mid gold in color and about 95% transparent.

N- Fruity yeast and hops, onion notes, light alcohol.

T-I can't pinpoint the fruit but maybe apple? A subtly sweet malt note cut short by some alcohol and hop dryness. Lightly bitter with a dry earthy finish

M- Medium body, slick and leading to a dry alcohol finish. Alcohol is up front yet not too overpowering.

O- A really nice, high ABV IPA. Not as thick as some Imperials, nor as interesting in hop note types as some. Quite easy to drink."
Houblon Chouffe,3.94,"330ml beir - best before 4-20 '22

Pours up looking like chunky DUFF, this looks like movie beer but better. Smells medicinally bitter and boozy, with a kiss of honey. Spice and booze up front and then you're hit with the bitter back end complete with fruit and more spice.

Not a big fan of the style, but this one is a decent change of pace"
Nillerzzzzz,4.15,"This one awoke Raul’s senses like Adriana Lima crossing the street in a onesie - but it’s still a onesie. Adriana in a skin tight pencil skirt this is not. It’s just too thin and not robust like John Goodman as Big Dan Teague.

See you in the funny papers!"
Nillerzzzzz,4.43,"Poured pitch black with absolutely no head. At the nose is heavy vanilla, fragrance is sweet and delectable. Hard to pick up the bourbon but good nonetheless.

Then upon tasting, very heavy bourbon. Almost overwhelming and unbalanced. The vanilla is faint at first but as the more sips I take, the heavy sweet vanilla character starts to build. Faint marshmallow and vanilla bean ice cream. But I don’t know...for the hype, I kinda expected a little more sweetness (talking liquid dessert) from the vanilla and maybe less booze.

Mouthfeel more medium bodied; not super full and thick but still some richness from the flavors.

Overall: great beer! Been one of those beers I’ve wanted to try for quite a while. I would always be happy to drink this again and even make it to the next release if I could. But I admit, it was a little over hyped. I guess I had my expectations way high."
Go To IPA,3.75,"After trying a lot of session IPAs, I basically ended up avoiding the style save for Founder's All-Day. Well, this bottle of beer, which I consumed on the porch during the pandemic, reminds me a lot of All-Day. It has a soft hop bitterness. Many sessions are almost overly hopped and quite thin without the malt backbone."
Go To IPA,3.74,"330ml can.
L: Hazy marmalade colour with a long lasting head and sheets of lacing.
S: Incredible rich, earthy aroma. Like freshly turned soil.
T: Wood and resin.
F: Bitter and astringent, as it’s supposed to be.
O: A full-on west coast IPA at only 4.7%. It’s technically very accomplished but the mouthfeel still suffers and I’m not convinced that a beer this bitter will ever be truly sessionable, regardless of its ABV."
Go To IPA,3.88,"330 ml can, brewed in Berlin. ABV is 4.7%. Bought at Gulating Ølutsalg, Stavanger. Hazy golden colour, small white head. Aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, a hint of dill. Hoppy and citrussy flavour, slightly sweet, also notes of tropical fruits and pine needles. Bitter finish. Good beer."
Go To IPA,3.96,"Clear gold, great white head, awesome retention and lace
Pine, orange zest, and light dank
Light orange and pine, a little bit of sweet malt, but kinda thin tasting
Light bodied and good carbonation
I feel that this would be a good beer for outside around the grill in the summer, not just getting in from walking the dog in the winter. I'd probably like it better then. Tried my best to be objective"
Go To IPA,4.03,"12oz bottle, tulip, bottled on 10/22/20.

Light gold yellow, big fluffy head with great retention.

Nectarine, lemon, tangerine. Impressively aromatic with lots of delicate fruit.

Two row, gritty bitterness that’s really great for a session IPA, and lots of fruitiness. Lychee, tangerine, white grape, stone fruit.

Light body, dry finish, impressive bitterness.

In the running for best session IPA I’ve had. Hop aroma and flavor are all there, including significant bitterness and great drying, bitter finish not usually seen in the sub-style."
Go To IPA,3.73,"A: Pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

S: Zesty citrus, mostly lemon and grapefruit, grassy, resinous pine, and crackery malt.

T: Citrus zest, grapefruit and lemon,a little tangerine and lime, grassy, resinous pine, subtle fruity notes, passion fruit, peach, apricot, and mango, crackery malt, pretty much bone dry finish.

M: Light body, moderately lively carbonation.

O: Haven't had this one since it was first released, before I was on BA, so it's nice to get to try it again. Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. That said, it does have a bit of the trademark session IPA watery-ness, and there are other session IPAs out there with a bit more balance and flavor. Wouldn't turn it down, but wouldn't be my ""go to""."
Go To IPA,3.93,"Appearance: Lightly hazy, bright golden hue, slim white head.

Aroma: As advertised, very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops. Bold and bright citrus and pine. Ah, so nice.

Taste: More of that big, fierce and shining hop flavor, with just enough juicy malt below. Lean bodied, with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much. Faced with the choice of this or a regular Stone IPA, I know where I'm going.

This one is merely ""okay"", and that's not what I expect out of Stone. Low on my priorities."
Go To IPA,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Clear, bright golden color, with a finger or so of creamy white head. Good retention and lacing.

Getting a lot of citrus notes in the aroma. Orange, lemon, and lime zest, along with the fruits themselves, some biscuity malt, mango, and a strong smell of pineapple.

Tasting primarily the citrus zest and rinds too. Nicely bitter hops, some pine and resin added in the flavor, along with the biscuity malt. Can't say that this beer tastes sweet however. Body is medium light."
Go To IPA,3.77,"12oz botted 10-22-20, best by 2-19-21. Opened 11-26-20.
1 finger white head with very good retention. Full, sticky lacing.
Clean, bright, golden IPA.
Lemon-lime in the nose up front with a bit of green (grass/pine) underneath.
Zesty lemon and spicy grapefruit bitterness are the prevalent flavors. Some stone fruit - peach as well.
Light body, bright entry, medium + carbonation. Moderate but lingering bitterness in the dry finish.
Well done, Very Good as a sub-5% IPA."
Go To IPA,3.05,"Rich gold colour, big frothy head, three fingers. Smell some pineapple and fruity smells. Taste is of hefty piney hops and is thin and extremely bitter with next to no malt base to balance it out. Feel is watery, very bitter and acrid. Not an IPA I will go to again unless it's for free."
Go To IPA,3.41,"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of citrus, light pineapple. Taste is of citrus, lemon zest, mild bitterness, zero malts are present. Feels medium/light bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
Go To IPA,3.75,"I was given this can by my cousin as a gift but since I have such a backlog here, it took me a while to get around to this. Canned on 10/26/17 with enjoy by date of 1/24/18 printed below it, I did not have this fresh but did keep it cold until I cracked it open today. It's been a while since I've had anything from Stone and although their IPA's were a big reason why I love that style so much now, this one was just a bit underwhelming to me...

The pour was decent as the liquid was golden, fairly translucent, and topped off with plenty of head. Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That's exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren't enough to put this over the top.

Regardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale. Not really feeling this one but because of the age, it's hard to tell whether that was because of my inaction in getting around to this or the beer itself. If you're looking for a ""light' version of their flagship IPA, reach for this and please, consume it fresh!"
Go To IPA,3.29,"The Go To IPA pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a big 1 finger rocky and soapy looking head that fades rather slowly. The smell is dank and hop forward from the Cascade hops, with hints of stone fruit, citrus and a lemon zest with grapefruit and floral notes, along with a bit of malt sweetness. Let’s see how it goes down…rather smooth across the palette with a medium mouthfeel. You get a nice dose of pithy citrus up front with some tropical fruits with a good pine bite. The sweet malt follows with a bit of prickly carbonation. As it finishes quite dry."
The Abyss,4.11,"12oz bottled 4/28/21 (nearly one year ago) poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 11.8% ABV per label. The beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. Sparce lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate, roasted malt and oak barrel. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak, bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. The substantial ABV is well hidden. Overall, very good."
The Abyss,4.27,"No head. Smell is rich dark chocolate, cherry, hints of coffee and bourbon. Lots going on in the mouth— upfront cherry, milk and dark chocolate, hoppy pine bitterness, caramel, oak char, coffee on the finish, and a bit more hops. The barrel is there, though it doesn’t dominate. Feel is thick and smooth. The kind of beer that you can mull over and find all sorts of different things."
The Abyss,4.49,"Pours jet black with fine chocolate colored head.

Smell is roasty and sweet wth notes of coffee, hazelnuts, chocolate, oak, vanilla, cinnamon and a hint of ginger.

Taste is roasty and a bit sweet. Notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa and a slight hint of smoked ham. Soft bitterness with a finish of tobacco, licorice and tar pastilles. Lots going on, a quite deep and complex.

Mouthfeel is medium to full sm ooth and well carbonated.

Overall, a great stout. A long time want of mine that absolutely delivered."
The Abyss,5,"At the brewery. 2015 vintage tasted 12/10/21

Fantastic"
The Abyss,4.25,"Deep dark opaque liquid with one finger of brown head. Lacing is minor so far.
Smell is rich dark coffee molasses a hint of licorice.
Taste is bitter dark roasted coffee dark chocolate molasses and a hint of licorice.
Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The finish is bitter sweet and rich.
Overall a delicious stout. Packaged on 4/28/21."
The Abyss,4.48,"Pours black with a thick tan head that dissipated quickly and some lacing.

Taste up front heavy malts, licorice and dark fruits with a hint of oak and char. Very smooth and creamy feel that coats your mouth and lingers well into the finish. A very nice offering."
The Abyss,4.06,"Lots of licorice, herbal hops, roast. An old-school American imperial stout. Wet bourbon character, not a lot of barrel. good if you like something strong and bitter"
The Abyss,2.98,"22oz bottle, dripped in wax an' all that, 2018 release, almost 3 years old to the date (short by about 3 weeks). ""Brewed with blackstrap molasses and licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, 50% is aged in bourbon, wine, and oak"". Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)

Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?"
The Abyss,4.58,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess.
If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking.
It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say.
The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say.
You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it.
It’s good. As I have said here before, better does exist. BBA Darkness, for example. But Abyss is lovely!"
The Abyss,3.75,"I waxn't enamored with this as others it seems. Don't know exactly why, maybe just me having a bad day? Maybe. But very glad I tried it."
The Abyss,4.17,"Crowler split with a friend. Picked up at Sabatinis in Exeter Pa a week ago

Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.

Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke.

On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast.

Overall, not as good as I hoped, roast a bit much for this palate."
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.4,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season."""
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.45,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.53,"REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.35,"Pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. The nose has oaky, boozy barrel notes, some dark chocolate, and stone fruit.

The barrel is forward on the taste, coasting into the dark chocolate and stone fruit notes, which works really well. The mouthfeel is full, but just the slightest bit watery. Overall, thought this is outstanding."
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.9,"#83, good stuff!"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.52,"A slight fizz, but then no head. Nearly black, pours thick.
Smell is a sweet molasses and caramel.
Taste is smooth, balanced. Not as complex as some, but still extremely flavorful. Plum and molasses.
Feel is outstanding. Creamy and silky smooth.
An excellent beer!"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,4.51,"Pours pitch black. Very thick looking. 1 finger tan head. Head retention is good. Some lacing on the glass.
The nose is rich with barrel notes. Caramel, chocolate, toffee, plums,
Up front is it has a lot of plum, which turns on the backside to chocolate, caramel, toffee, and vanilla.
Thick, so full bodied. Some burn, but not a lot. Smooth.
Solid BA stout."

O: Very drinkable. Masterpiece IPA"
Jai Alai IPA,4.25,"To my sophisticated palate, this IPA, out of all of them, plays the balance between ""east coast"" and ""west coast"" styles perfectly. It's got that citrus, tropical juiciness of the east yet all of the piney, resinous character of the left coast. I especially enjoy it in the 19.2 oz taller boy can."
Jai Alai IPA,4.4,"Available almost everywhere in the US, this take on a classic American IPA is just Great. Pair it up with whatever you’re doing, whatever you’re eating. Dress it up or slosh it down.

We have a Winner, Folks!"
Jai Alai IPA,4.61,"As most have stated, this is the standard for juicy IPAs. They just hit the nail on the head with the balance of juice, pine, bite. Beautiful golden copper color. Strong but not overwhelming ABV. One of my top 4 IPAs (Space Dust, Scofflaw Basement, Wicked Weed Freak of Nature)."

Jai Alai IPA,4.22,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Slightly hazy pale amber color with a foamy white head that receded to a thin film but left some rings of lace. Strong citrus and hop resin aroma.

Feel: It has a medium body and has medium high bitterness in the finish.

Overall, well balanced and flavorful porter that is quick easy drinking in spite of the bit of a bitter bite."
Robust Porter,4.29,"I honestly dont know how I have never reviewed this beer on BA. Ive consumed this beer well over 100 times for sure.
Im pouring a cellar temp 12 oz can into my snifter. the beer pours a rich mahogany color but doesnt allow any light to pass through when I hold up the glass.
A dense creamy head of 3 cm foams up even with a gentle pour and this foam remains as a sturdy surface layer throughout the sampling. I also scattered lattice when I take a sip or swirl my glass.
The aroma on this beer is roasted malt, a bit of char, maybe tobacco too. This mixes some dark chocolate and just a hint of caramel. Spot on nose and appealing. Reminds me why I used to drink this beer so often.
The first sip reveals a medium body and medium tingly carbonation. The beer drinks really easy on the physical traits.
Flavor is roasted malt, some dark chocolate, hints of caramel and brown sugar too. This creates some balance and doenst make the beer sweet, just increases the complexity of flavors. There is also a bit of molasses on the finish and then the roast malt lingers long after each sip.
No hints of any booze and I dont get much hop profile. Very nice porter, that I will get back to buying more frequently again!"
Robust Porter,4.17,"L: The stoutest looking porter I've had. It pours a solid black with a tall, foamy dark tan head that slowly dissolves into a thick film, leaving some nice lacing along the way.
S: Coffee, cocoa, smoke from a good cigar
T: very complex flavors that meld well. Roasted malts, strong coffee with a little sugar, 90% cocoa dark chocolate, tobacco, caramel or molasses, the burnt crust of a roasted marshmallow, toasted Russian rye bread, all followed by some bittering hops
F: medium-full bodied and smooth, slight tingle from little carbonation and a bitter-sweet finish.
O: This is damn good. Buy it."
Robust Porter,4.36,"L - dark brown with thick two-finger deep tan head. Good, sticky lacing.
S - roast malt. Oak?
T - follows the nose for sure. Nice.
F - thick mouthfeel with semi - dry finish.
O - really good beer! Really enjoyed it. One heck of a solid beer."
Robust Porter,4.18,"Large but short lived dense mocha colored head leaves good lacing atop a black body. Roasted malt aroma with threads of chocolate, chicory and dried fruit. Earthy, smoky flavors of the roasted malts are reminiscent of hearty pumpernickel bread washed down with a strong cup of coffee. Aftertaste swings toward a bitter, modestly hopped, long lasting finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied and moderately carbonated."
Robust Porter,4.21,"Very delicious beer.

Nice dark color - deep, deep brown.

Some light pleasant smell.

Very nice taste. Full flavored. Very slight bitterness.

Excellent porter."
Robust Porter,4.46,"look: black,

smell: burnt bread :D

taste: burnt, smoky, malty, roasty, coffee, complex

feel: creamy, thin, burnt/sweet finish, crushable

overall: I love it"
Robust Porter,2.75,"This beer has gone downhill, sadly, since my last taste in 2013. We got a growler fill at the brewery ($6/64oz) and poured some into a pint glass when we arrived home. The look was as inviting now as it was then - dark brown, almost shimmering. The smell was our first clue. It smelled - artificial. We don'r homebrew so we don't know what we were smelling, but it wasn't good. We took a sip, followed quickly by a healthy gulp. It tasted as if the malted grain had been scorched, like old coffee grounds. There was that artificial taste again. I was disappointed; this had been a great beer. For the first time ever, I drain poured the rest of the 64oz. Something not good's going on at Smuttynose."
Robust Porter,3.4,"I'm not a porter lover but this wasn't awful. This is the Tennessee Titans of porters. Average. Smooth and goes down easy but I just don't see the BA love for this. It's decidedly ok. Not great. Not Terrible, definitely not a 92 though. Like the Titian's they have promise with Derrick Henry, but they also have Ryan Tannehill."
Robust Porter,4.22,"Pours deep copper with a 1/4 inch tan head, which quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing.

Aroma of molasses, chocolate, coffee.

Tastes of molasses, chocolate malt, coffee, cascade hops and possibly magnum hops?

Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Oily, slightly bitter finish.

Pretty tasty. Lack of a lasting head is a bit of a bummer, but a darn good porter none-the-less. ""Make mine a Smutty""!"
Robust Porter,4.05,"12 Oz Can poured into glass
Look - very dark brown colored, frothy medium foam head lingers. Lots of lacing.
Smell - not super pungent but there is some roasted malt, some milk chocolate. Subtle earthiness.
Taste - crisp roasted malt almost burnt. Creamy dark roast coffee. Bitter hops in the finish. It has balance but the lingering aftertaste is bitter almost burnt marshmallow malt. Carbonation is medium and body is medium-heavy.

Overall, starts out pleasant on the palate but turns from sweet into quite bitter. One of the more charred porters out there. The name says it all, it is robust. Good but not something i would go for regularly. Grade is an A-"
Robust Porter,4,Pours dark. Light head. Not much of an aroma. Clean smooth body followed by a heavy malt finish. Tastes burnt and smokey. Good balance. A very good porter.
Robust Porter,4.36,"One of the better porters available. Great feel, foreshadowed by a delicious bouquet of coffee dark chocolate roastiness wafting up your olfactory nerve. Tasty porter flavors leaning slightly towards stout territory (for me means minus raisin notes etc...). Easy drinking and smooth."
Robust Porter,4.29,"Reviewed as part of BJCP training. 20A American porter
Thick tan creamy head, decent retention, good lacing, super dark brown basically black, opaque

Nose big dark malts, a little roasty almost char, plenty of chocolate, cocoa, little roasted coffee and slight Smokey burnt malts,

Taste rich dark malts, slight burnt smokey malt, with more dark chocolate and mild roasted coffee, despite heavy roasty it's smooth and not harsh or acrid, some mild earthy almost spicy hops kick in with medium to higher bitterness on combination with the malt, hint of sweetness, drier finish, lingering bitterness but smooth

Mouth is full bod, medium carb, smooth richness

Overall quite nice, not sure how I haven't reviewed this yet, great classic American robust porter"
Robust Porter,4.35,"One of my all time favorites! I haven't seen this in a while, I'll find it and enjoy. Feliz Navidad'"
Robust Porter,3.62,"Looks and smells the part. Black porter small bubble filled tan head with some lacing.

Burning wood smells, some raisin, some vanilla scent.

Some light, sweet maltiness in the front. Not much backing it up. Then some smoky grains in a long finish. Nothing unpleasant, just a bit unbalanced. And I pick up a little vanilla in the end.

Too much carbonation takes away an otherwise smooth feel. Highly drinkable as promised. Hides the alcohol.

Not sure where the robust is, but a fair offering."
Robust Porter,4.25,No fan of porters usually but this is a winner.
Coolship Red,4.3,"This is likely spot-on for style, but a bit too much pucker for me. Pours a beautiful berry-red with a quick-fading cap of white. Aroma is heavenly raspberry and very mild funk. Flavors are delicious as well, with tons of berry dominating. Very tart. So tart. But, I don't review so much for style attributes, but whether I enjoy. This one took me 2 sittings."
Coolship Red,3.95,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, as part of the beatings he delivered during NBS BIF #15. 12.7oz Cork and Caged bottle (Packaged Dec 3 2020) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a lovely dark red color with about 1/8 inch of pink head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing.

The aroma was solidly full of raspberry, with just a light bit of grain in the background.

On the tongue, a big hit of bitterness punches the front of the palate, with raspberry dominating the rest.

The body was light, crisp, had decent carb, and a very dry finish.

Drinkability was very good, I'd like to have regular access to this.

Overall, a very good beer. A must-try if you see it."
Coolship Red,4.12,"375ml bottle from 2012.

Pours dark copper with a burgundy tinge. Quickly fizzling head with zero retention or lacing. Fairly evident raspberries in the nose with faint cider vinegar and diaper. Light bodied with a slickish, limp mouthfeel. Raspberries on the palate with a solid tartness but short of sour or jammy. Finishes with a nice balance of tart and raspberries."
Coolship Red,4.21,"Draft at the brewery.

Lovely clear pinkish red. Smell is tart and kinda funky. Flavor follows, oak and funk manifest most in the swallow."
Coolship Red,4.24,"12.7oz corked and caged on 12/3/20. Opened 1-16-22.
1/2"" pink tinted head, limited retention and ends up as a partial cap and ring. No lacing. The beer is a glowing red/purple with very good clarity - beautiful color. Tart raspberry, oak, light funk, and vinous quality in the nose. Awesome tart raspberry flavor, bright, rich fruit with bracing acidity. Light body, bright entry, medium acid, all in a dry, tart fruit-filled finish. Outstanding."
Coolship Red,4.7,"Pours a vibrant red with low pink head.

Smell is tart and vinous with notes of fresh raspberries, raspberry jam, lime, oak and bit of funk.

Taste is phenomenal. Tart with tons of fresh raspberries and a bit of jam. Dry and vinous with notes of peach, oak, funk and a bit of bitterness. Nice acidity and tremendous balance.

Mouthfeel is medium and dry with effervescent carbonation.

Overall, a stunning beer. I am a huge fan for raspberries in beer, and this is close to the daddy, Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus."
Coolship Red,4.59,Ruby red color somewhat translucent. Licorice and raspberry on the nose. Candied raspberry tart taste with some very yeast notes. Really pops in the mouth; crisp. Lots of flavors here. Solid beer.
Coolship Red,4.5,"Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries."
Coolship Red,4.49,"Appearance - The beer was pinkish red is color with white bubble clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries.

Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was fairly intense, allowing for a dry finish.

Overall - This was a fine, well balanced sour."
Coolship Red,4.5,"Look: beautiful, opaque garnet red. Soft white head evaporates quickly; no lace. Ring of tiny bubbles along the glass.

Smell: subtle sour raspberries. Some funk. All gorgeous.

Taste: sharp, tangy, sour raspberry with some funk and vinegar. Beautiful rich fruit with sharp notes taking it up and up.

Feel: Lots of sharp, active, elevating tiny bubbles. Sharp on the tongue in the best possible way.

This is a magnificent beer. All angles, sharpness, acid, funk, and fruit. And bubbles. It's alive..."

Very tart , fizzy sudsing , tart bone dry finish

Good beer"
Coolship Red,3.46,I want more funk. The raspberry character is big but the beer lacks depth. Would love to get some musty barnyard or brett character to provide some dimension. Wouldn't buy again.
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.38,"September 2021 bottle.

Looks: Slightly cloudy orange/gold, no head or legs.

Smells: Sour and funky, lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing, hey?). I get apricot, orange zest, citron, green apple, pineapple, wood, a bit of bread, and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation.

Tastes: Similar to the nose but less fruity, mostly apricot, citrus, and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt, with the sourness and funk being more prominent. Gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after.

Feels: Nice medium body, a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesn't linger very long.

Overall: Heck yeah. Awesome gueuze, lives up to the Cantillon hype even if it's not mind-blowing."
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.34,"A 750ml corked and capped bottle, 20/21 season, bottled on 1st October 2020. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass.

Appearance: A mostly clear golden orange colour with a big two finger white head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a thin cap while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Sour, tart, funky, musty, wet wood, green apple, grapefruit zest, with a touch of white grapes.

Taste: Sour, tart, slightly sweet, funky, oak, apricot, with some light lemon zesty notes.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: A nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze. Perfect for a hot summer day."
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.42,"Smell of tart cherries and some yeasty bread. Orange-ish pour with visible active carbonation. Flavor is tart but nothing like the kettle sours of today. More balanced, and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through. This is surprisingly mellow in the finish, with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold.

My first Cantillon offering, and shared with a couple friends at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast."
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.19,Bottle pour- opaque dark golden color with quickly dissipating white head. Nose is a bit funky with hints of tart fruit and yeast.. Taste follows with a a tart and tangy crispness. An interesting brew that I liked more than expected.
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.41,"Rich gold body is almost copper, clear and shining, forming a fine fizzy head, off white and holding retention for a little over a minute before dwindling to a thin layer.
Aroma is lightly tart and fruity like white grapes, wheat, honey.
Fresh, bright, and light - feels like summer in an orchard; reminiscent of spanish sidre, with flavours of crisp sweet/tart apples and hay, with a whisper of funk, a light lactic tang, the freshest mountain water, oak; it's the perfect level of sourness, enough to make you smack your lips, but not pucker; the finish is dry and flavour lingers; the feel is prickly and finely effervescent, medium bodied, crisp yet silky.

Beautiful in it's simplicity and refinement. Not particularly complex, it is pure and deftly crafted, and approachable."

Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.54,"375 ml bottle. Dated August 27, 2020.

Pours a lightly cloudy bright golden color with a small white cap. Modest retention. Leaves a few legs of lacing along the glass as the head dissipates.

Strong aromas of barnyard funk, white wine vinegar, pears, stone fruit and citrus zest. Lighter notes of oak, grass, green apple, and vanilla.

The taste has a lot of white wine grape and pears, as well as green apple, apricot, lemon, yeast and lime zest. There's also plenty of oak and vanilla. Subtly grassy and tannic. Tart, but not overly so.

The feel is light and extremely effervescent. Crisp. Exceptionally dry on the finish.

Overall, this is a fantastic beer. It's wonderfully complex yet very drinkable. This is not a style I'm an expert on, but I know a great beer when I have one and this one is truly great."
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.46,"been meaning to try this for a long time but it is tricky to find in dublin, found myself in an off license on baggot street yesterday and picked it up, bottled june 2020, a cloudy honey colour beer with a smattering of white bubbles on top, aroma is funk forward, tart, leathery, goaty, acidic, sweet, caramel, honey, pear, apple, rhubarb, lime, smells gorgeous frankly, taste is sweeter than other gueuzes i’ve tried, but totally delicious, the balance between the funky sour flavours, the acidic wooden flavours and the sweetness is perfect, rhubarb, cherry, pear, honeycomb, vanilla, oak, white wine, leathery, floral, feint hint of bitterness on the finish, beer is light to medium bodied with light carbonation, dry, puckering sourness, very drinkable, all in all a damn good beer that lives up to its reputation"
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.3,"375 ml corked bottle. Large head, disappears rapidly. Deep golden colour, cloudy when the yeast is poured. Heavenly aroma of barnyard and ensilage with white wine vinegar elements. Flavour is crisp and very dry, reminiscent of a very dry white wine or brut champagne. Not as complex as I expected. Really a beer for the ""Champagne Brut"" people."
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.71,"L:. Pours a bubbly brilliant clear straw gold, the head lingers for a while and dissipates rather quickly and leaves no lacing.

S: The dry yeasty funk hits the nose first and is very inviting, followed by notes of peach and light citrus fruit, followed by a nice nutty bread in the end.

T:. Yeasty, funky and dry, peachy and white wine grape, with notes of pear, a dry bitterness. Everything is very harmonious and creates an amazing beer.

F:. Light body, and very easy drinking.

O:. This beer is definitely world class"
Gueuze 100% Lambic,4.8,"2018 vintage, 33cl bottle with a picture of a little statue cherub holding a glass in one hand and the other hand is covering his genitals.

The pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head.

Smells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer.

The flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes."

Scaled Way Up,4.56,"No age on this one, filled in a growler on 3/12/20. I believe it's 3-4 weeks since brewing.

Pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. Big nose of mango, dried peach, candied ruby grapefruit, cara cara orange, slight bubblegum, pineapple, over-ripened apricot and Portuguese sweet bread. Just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma, love it. Tons of flavor on first sip, all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya, slight dankness, honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin. I'm so glad I got a 64oz growler of this one! So good! Wonderful soft, slightly resin-y medium body but I kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness. Medium- bitterness, medium drying, medium- prickly carbonation.. Today was my first time on jury duty and I'm glad I stopped by Trillium for this one, I can't think of a better brew to relax with after a long day."
Scaled Way Up,4.41,"On tap at Bayberry Beer Hall in RI, pours a murky hazed yellow, small white head that fades fast

The smell is incredible here, an overload of papaya, banana, pineapple, orange and mango, just the lightest hop bite to back it up

The taste is a bit of a letdown compared to the aroma but still awesome. I get piney, resinous hops, a light florality, very tropical

The feel is nice and prickly, pretty highly carbonated and drinks medium bodied

Some pretty amazing stuff right here, super easy drinking but still really interesting"
Scaled Way Up,4.46,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a small white head.

S: Big nose of hops - earthy & fruity (pineapple, blueberries) hops.

T: Bright, juicy pineapple with lemony blueberries and an earthy dankness. Touch of white wine (Nelson is in the house). Finishes with modest heat felt in the belly but not on the palate.

M: Creamy/juicy in feel, medium in heft.

O: Good stuff."
Scaled Way Up,3.55,"Thanks to yllib for fresh can.
Super thick hazy appearing. Dark yellow.
Creamy head. Minimal lacing.
Standard tropical hop aromas.
Standard tropical hop tastes. Some citrus and wine notes in there. Some dankness for good measure.
Good mouthfeel, but there’s a significant hop burn going down. I think they went too far with the dry-hopping. Instead of bitter taste they accentuated the throat burning effect.
To me an average to below-average hazy, in a giant sea of average hazies.
I’m shocked that it was rated this well actually. I can only attribute it to hazy hype and/or rewarding for pushing the limits."
Scaled Way Up,4.06,"L: bright yellow/orange. Attractive

S: slightly earthy and very fruity, nectarine skin and peach flesh and orange juice.

T: had Fresh on draft the day it was canned, picked up a lot of hop burn and bitterness, almost An unenjoyable amount. 3 weeks later, the can I’m enjoying still exhibits sharp bitterness and not much else. There is zero subtly here, and yes I know the point is to scale things “way up”, but this literally hits just one hop-burn note. Disappointing for sure

F: more balanced than some recent trillium offerings, not as sticky sweet with this one

O: ehhh, not worth the hype at all, like so much of what trillium offers nowadays"

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.43,"Pours pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head. Aroma and taste giving off loads of roasted malt, peat, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, black cherry, prune, caramel, molasses, tobacco, drying oak tannin, significant bourbon, nice amount of vanilla.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.52,"12oz bottle, package date of 11/17/21. Pours black with a very small sized brown head. Smells of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, dark fruit, dark roasted malt, and earthy hops. The taste follows exactly. Good intensity and balanced flavors. Moderate bitterness and dryness in the finish. Above average body and low carbonation. Overall this is a great barrel aged RIS; strong yet smooth and drinkable."
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.38,"Many thanks to Erland for sharing this one. Pkgd 11/17/21. 13.4% ABV, 12oz bottle.
Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing. The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied. Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so. Taste is a recap of the nose. The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts. Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough. It's a heavy hitter and very rich. This might be great over dark chocolate ice cream. Hrmmm. Might have to try that."
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,Black in color with no light penetration. There's a fingernail of brown around the rim. The aroma is of piney hops and dark malt. I'm tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon. The mouth is thick and chewy.

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,I have to say I liked this one much better once it warmed up. Before it warmed up it there was a big chocolate taste with some barrel. After it warmed the other flavors started to pop. The chocolate faded a bit and vanilla and coffee flavors became more present. The barrel also came to the forefront. A bit thin but very good overall.
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,"12oz bottled 11/17/2021 poured into a snifter at 47° Fahrenheit 13.4% ABV. The beer pours pitch black with zero light penetration and minimal light brown head. The head recedes to an irregular ring and leaves a few tiny spots of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, deeply charred oak barrel, bourbon, coffee and chocolate fudge. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. No alcohol presence in the aroma or taste, which is incredible for the ABV. Overall, excellent to world class. The balance is key. All the tastes are wonderfully integrated."

Pours black, brown along the edges, with essentially no head. Smell is boozy, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and very dark chocolate / dark roasted coffee.

Taste is boozy and super anise-y. Lots of roasty bitterness, lots of boozy sweetness. Fairly soft and well-balanced, actually.

Mouthfeel is thick and fluffy. Overall, very nice."
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.57,"2018 Vintage
12oz bottle poured into a tulip

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy dark khaki head that reduces to a thin ring around the glass

S- huge barrel aromas on the nose; spicy oak, barrel juice, caramel and vanilla. Bold aromas of chocolate brownie batter, dark chocolate, molasses, mocha cream, anise, charred malt, figs & raisins. Just a hint of underlying piney hops and booze

T- bold barrel notes lead the way with strong barrel juice, peppery oak and complimenting notes of caramel and vanilla. Mid-palate brings out notes of brownie batter, chocolate fudge, herbal coffee, charred malt, black licorice and figs. The finish gives more bold barrel juice and a hint of piney hops. Lingers of bourbon and brownie batter

M- heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety warming finish

O- an already world class base beer gets taken up a notch with bold barrel notes that matches the dark roasted notes of Expedition, well done"

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.79,"Vintage 2020/5/18
This officially serves to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that not *everything* from 2020 was a dumpster fire.
Appearance is amazing, maybe because I was so ready for a beer, but few beers have looked better. Black with dark brown highlights and a thin brown head.
The aroma was malts and plums and raisins and more malts. The taste. I literally said “wow” - (I was so ready for this) just so smooth without sharp edges typically found in RISs, maybe the bourbon, maybe the aging, can’t say, but wow.
The feel, obviously IMO, but it struck me as ideal for the genre. Viscous but not too much. And I mentioned smoothness earlier, oh yes.
So glad they are in Michigan. Thanks Larry for this."
King JJJuliusss,4.07,"Canned on 8/9/22; consumed on 9/9/22

Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.

Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.

Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout."

Smell -grainy citrus dank slight caramel
taste -grainy citrus dank caramel earthy
Feel -thick creamy light carb
Overall - wish the taste lived up to everything else but still incredible"
King JJJuliusss,4.69,"Canned 8/9/22. Purchased 8/16/22 at Charlton.

L: Pours an opaque deep orange with a short creamy head that sticks to the edge of the glass after thinning. Irregular and pretty lacing.

S: Aromas of peach, mango, cantaloupe and orange. A rich mix of tropical and citrus.

T: Citrus up front, then seamlessly blends into a tropical middle. Finishes dry and only slightly bitter. No heat.

F: Classic Tree House soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.

O: A superb amping up of Julius. Waves of flavor without getting sweet or boozy."
King JJJuliusss,4.44,"8/7/22 Canned 5/20/22. Another World Class 100 brew from TH. Smooth, tropical , balanced. Mango."
King JJJuliusss,4.99,The perfect hazy beer. Zero flaws. The pinnacle of the style.
King JJJuliusss,3.83,I was really excited to visit Treehouse and buy this. But….this is nothing special and that confuses me. It’s decent but I expected a WOW - why am I missing?

Oude Geuze Vintage,4.11,"750 ml ""champagne"" bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet). ABV is 6%. Bottle date: 14-02-2007, the ""best before"" date also reads 02-2007, which obviously must be a misprint. Hazy golden colour, big white head. Lovely aroma of lemons and other sour fruits, with strong notes of farmhouse and horse stable. The flavour is very sour and tart, with lemony notes and a dry and astringent finish with noticeable hops."
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.71,2016 vintage. Bottled on 09/02/2016. Enjoyed on 02/11/2021.
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.64,Delicious
Oude Geuze Vintage,4.77,"Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass.

Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.

The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.

It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.

Absolutely scrumptious, with an unbelievable mouthfeel."

Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.44,"Poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly.
The aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate.
The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed.
The feel was good, ideal even. Not sure if it could be better. Ideally viscous.
OA- very happy to have been able to try this finally!"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.97,If you've ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla. This beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste. Color is dark and consistency is very smooth. It's a shame I can't buy it in Texas.
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.43,Can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. Nose is vanilla and coffee for days. Taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. Vanilla lingers on the finish. Tasty.
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.21,"2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout."
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.37,"After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs

The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note

A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond

A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee

Damn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.87,"Yesss!
Well, you might hate it - or you might love it!
My wife didn’t like it but I did. Even though I’m not so fond of Porters or Stouts but THIS ONE, I’m telling you was really good!
Vanilla and coffee. Vanilla is really present in the aroma, sweet, but like some cookies or sweets or a kind of a cake? Very pleasant. And its taste is just as good as it smells!!! This isn’t always the case, as I’m sure you must have observed that beers often smell “better” than they taste - but this one was astounding. Sweet but not syrupy, sweet like vanilla sugar. Coffee? Not 100% sure I could decipher it, but maybe overall the thing tasted like drinking a Starbucks latte with vanilla added on top? Oh yes, don’t forget about its booziness, which isn’t harsh at all, rather makes the whole thing taste and feel like an Irish coffee.
This was the first that I had of this kind but it made me curious, I think I might seek more of such coffee or vanilla or oatmeal-infused Porters or Stouts out. Worth giving it a try!"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.79,"Initially: robust/strong taste. After several months of sampling Porters and Stouts, Victory at Sea sat AFRAID in the corner of the refrigerator...reattemped tonight; world class favorite!"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.02,"Smells like a starchy vanilla espresso. Tastes like one too almost, though the coffee is more pronounced and it almost has a dark chocolate taste. A good unique beer, though the smell is a bit too much for my preference."
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,3.99,"Notes from 2/25/2020.
On tap at the Draft House in Austin and served in a 5oz snifter.
The appearance is dark brown with a thin tan ring of foam around the rim. 3.75
The aroma is medium in strength and of delicious chocolate covered caramel, and a little salt. How can a beer smell this good?! 4.75
The taste is moderately strong with chocolate covered caramel, roasted malt, boose, and a moderately bitter finish. 3.75
The mouth feel is above medium in thickness with moderate carbonation. 3.75
Overall, it's very good but it's not quite my thing. I think it's how the bitterness mixes with the flavor. 3.75"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.83,"Ballast Point scores a home run with this big and bold imperial porter. The smell of vanilla greets you pleasantly and invitingly, not overpowering as your first sip brings you beautiful flavor notes of coffee and smoky marshmallow maltiness. This is an amazing porter- one of my favorites. Drinking this on a cold winter day - this beer is nearly perfect. I discovered this beer last year at a St. Patrick’s Day parade when I stopped at a local tavern and it made for a great day!"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,3.93,"Dark golden brown color with tan cap and lacing.

Aroma at first of something like coconut, quickly followed by a vanilla laced light coffee which reminds me of a Kenya bean rather than something more robust from some other part of the World. Very clean and pleasant.

Taste is more coffeeish than coconut with some elements of roasted malt yet it's restrained. Again coconut blends with vanilla but that's just my perception. That all sounds rather sweet but the brew doesn't come across as sweet in the taste as it does in the scent. It finishes clean and dry.

Medium texture with balancing carbonation.

Overall it's a refreshing take on the Porter/Stout style, very drinkable."
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.41,"Bottle from Albertson's. Wow, just wow. Black gold. Chocolate and coffee,slick and oily. Campfire, burnt toast and coffee. Molasses, yum....and the vanilla for a little bit of marshmallow"
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.5,"This is my first time trying this beer and it doesnt dissapoint. Very dark, i would have thought it to be a stout. The vanilla smells hits you instantly followed by coffee and some roasted malt. The taste follows the nose to a tee, with the vanilla hitting first then the cofffe and malts backing it up. All in all this is the best porter I've ever had."
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.49,Excellent well balanced Imperial Porter! It surprised me by being light for an Imperial. Quite enjoyable!
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,4.71,"Ignoring the recent sale of Ballast Point to Kings and Convicts brewery, this is A GREAT imperial Porter! Their brewer notes description are right on for this. Notes of vanilla... Not to sweet.... low acidity.... Coffee comes through..... All flavors balanced so well! From bottle, an early Christmas present from my DW!"
1554,3.87,"Oh man, I've got to admit I am actually pretty dumb about beers but when I picked up this bottle in the store I totally expected it to be an amber colored beer in a brown bottle... I didn't realize what it was until I poured it, and upon pouring it I found it was dark and sparkling and it produced a nice thick head which ...didn't seem to last as long as I thought it should but the flavor is great, and in a few sippes I was sent me back 40 years to the first taste of a dark beer. I wonder how this would be at cellar temp?"
1554,3.97,"12oz bottle

Pours two massive fingers of tan head into my snifter. Retention is average, and the head fades within a few minutes. Lacing is pretty nice. Body is pitch black with some ruby hues when held to the light. Looks pretty good.

Nose is dry and roasty. Touch of spice to it / woody. Smells decent enough.

Flavor is just slightly roasty, but not much. Has some fruity esters in the finish. Some chocolate comes out as it warms. Tastes alright, somewhat underwhelming until it warms up though.

Carbonation is pretty high. Body is medium. Bitterness is medium-low. Has a touch of dryness, but pretty modest there, finishes with some sweetness - well balanced. A nice mouthfeel, the sweetness and carbonation help add some character where the flavor is lacking.

Drinkability is very good.

Once this warms up it's pretty tasty. Overall an enjoyable brew."
1554,3.64,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Tulip glass.
The color is dark brown with 1/2 fingers of tan head. Retention is poor.
The intensity of aroma is low. The aroma has caramel, toffee, a slight chocolate aroma and a slight coffee aroma with a hint of hops at the end.
The intensity of taste is closer to medium than high. The flavor follows the aroma with the addition of a ashy and pipe tobaco flavor. The bitterness is low.
The feel is somewhat above medium in thickness. Carbonation is a little below medium which tamps down the ashy pipe tobaco flavor. The astringency is closer to high than medium making it a quite dry beer.
Overall, it's very good. It's a beer that I waited until one bottle out of the Six-Pack was left to review it. I expected to give it a higher rating, but this often happens as I have more experience with rating and reviewing beers."
1554,4.49,"First time trying this beer, did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. A great 6% that is tasty and very smooth. The very good rating fits this to a tee."
1554,4.38,"Really nice beer. Like a coffee/chocolaty stout but light and easy. Dark amber color, soft head that quickly dissipates. I love a creamier stout, but this is good for the unique style it fits into."
1554,4.01,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. Pours very dark brown with a nice red color in direct sunlight. One finger light brown head that dissipates to a film with a constant ring through the drink. Half finger head returns with agitation half-way through the drink. Minor-to-medium lacing.

S - Wonderful bread and caramel malt scents. Dark fruits scents appear part way through. Light toasty scents as well.

T - Taste presents a solid chocolate bitterness up front. Nice nutty flavors too. Dark fruits in there as well. Some smokiness comes up as it warms up. No bitterness at all.

F - Medium-to-full mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Smooth drinking all the way through.

O - This was a very enjoyable beer. I drank in the hot summer in 99 degree weather, but this would be fantastic in the winter months. It might not beat my favored winter beers at higher ABV than this, but I have thoroughly enjoyed the handful of beers I’ve tried from New Belgium Brewing Co. I’d recommend you try this one if you like the sound of the flavor profile. As a fan of malt-forward beers, this beer was a joy to drink."
1554,3.94,"Poured dark mahogany with a light brown head that dissipated but left lots of lacing.
The aroma was very mild for me, damaged sniffer, but I did get some coffee, both rich and bitter. Good, perplexed but impressed.
The taste was really different. Gruit makes a noticeable difference in the dark lager genre. Almost nutty along with the chocolate and coffee centric malts.
The feel is ideal for the style, and the carbonation never quite ends.
Good beer!"
1554,3.79,"4/25/22 On tap at New Belgium, Asheville. The brewer notes on the history beyond this offering is really cool.

Color is dark mahogany, lacy.

Smell is malty and stoney at the same time.

Low carbonation. Smooth. Nice offering!"
1554,3.18,"355 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 6%. Very dark ruby to mahogany colour, nearly black. Small and shortlived beige head. Weak and uninteresting aroma, a little malts, a hint of chocolate and dust. The dry flavour is not very exciting either, but fairly refreshing. Moderate malts, a hint of chocolate again, also a hint of prunes and liquorice, very mild spices."
1554,3.58,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour it's dark but not black indoor lighting reveals a dark brown that let's a small amount of light through, held up to light it's a dark reddish brown with no haze. Less than one finger head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass.

Aroma is definitely influenced by licorice but very subtly and it blends into the dark malt sweetness quite well. The new Belgium website says there is in fact some nugget hops but they aren't very present in the aroma. Beyond the licorice it's similar to a belgian trippel/Dunkel in aroma if you were to combine the two traditional styles.

Taste is quite dry and yeasty but with some chocolate roasty malt notes. Some herbal bitterness but this beer is quite easy to drink and not the heaviest in flavor. I'd say this is pretty similar to the Baltic porter style. Lagery porter like beer but they don't call it either of those things. Some bitterness does creep up as you drink, dissimilar to hops, that seem to get less bitter as you drink. Definitely a dark malty beer

Feel is creamy but drinkable. Similar to a Baltic porter once again. Not light but not too heavy either. Big beer relative to a lot of what's out there but smaller than the trippel by these guys.

Overall an interesting beer that's not super traditional to any style it seems other than dark lager inspired by a mideavil beer recipe. It's good, not necessarily something that's sticking out to me though."
1554,4.42,Very crisp and light. Initial taste borders on sweet with bitter aftertaste. But that's good! Carbonation is disappointing but overall excellent dark brew.
1554,4.31,"Great appearance
Caramel and malt flavor with chocolate
Mouthfeel was nothing like I expected, instead it was very drinkable and crisp for such a dark lager
Light finish that leaves you wanting more"
1554,3.78,"I actually like this a good bit based on one bottle, body is good even with no glass and out of the bottle, does have lager vibes but it seems like it needs to be a smidge warmer like other dark brews to be enjoyed. Relatively impressed and glad cuz for some reason I don't have a great liking for a lot of their beer"
1554,4.09,"(12 oz bottle, 68799 06MAR22; purchased single off shelf at Total Wine, Tucson... poured into a stemless wine glass)

L: clear, ruby-garnet liquid; fleeting, flimsy, tanned khaki-colored foam... about what one would expect from a non-bottle condition rendering of this derivative style... keeps a thin yet tight collar; little lacing

S: old upholstery, dry port, desiccating plum, hint of red cough medicine... overall weak(ened) intensity but inviting expression

T: up front: curiously roasty, oxidized dark sherry overtones; bit of a prune color to its dry aftertaste.... second sip reveals more depth: fruitcake, berry jelly, hints of toasty dark crystal malt... ehhh, I could see a justifiable (doppel)bock comparison... overall: dry, malty, mulled wine

F: velvety carbonation softening the edges of its whispery-plush body; calm caress of residual warmth... maybe this is a lager... too suave

O: low-key high quality, but I'll take Ommegang Abbey Ale any day over this... this was the last of 4 consecutive reviews this morning of brands I can't readily procure out east... I love the 'Euro dark lager' label for this, because it's sort of appropriate, despite this being an undeniably familiar relic of early craft beer Dubbel knock-offs... as a 'lager', it's great, but c'mon, don't corrupt my to-style ratings bro; their zwert story is romantically compelling but bs - doesn't result in a distinctive brew... arguably slightly higher marks than it deserves (bland, rough edges), but I'd have this again (1849)"
1554,4.03,"Look: Dark brown to black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light with a short-lasting head that settles to a film and leaves good lacing behind
Aroma: Warm brown bread, light chocolate notes, wafts of licorice, a little toffee, and mild earthy notes
Taste: Rich bready malt, toffee, and chocolate are the initial notes and after they settle, some nice light licorice appears along with some earthiness. The flavors all meld well before brown bread and chocolate take hold and close it out
Mouthfeel: Full but light, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and clean finish
Overall: I dig it. I love these folks’ Belgian offerings so scoring this as part of their mix 12-pack was a fun and tasty chance to revisit. The licorice notes make it unique tasting and smelling and they work well here in my opinion plus help set this apart from other Euro Dark Lagers (which although this is an ale, feels/tastes like a lager). Unique, well-made, and tasty"
1554,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. The appearance of the beer resembles a sort of cola/mahogany color, with more than a finger's worth of fluffy tan head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: very malty, and rich notes of coffee and chocolate/cocoa. Other notes of toffee, subtle vanilla, licorice, spices, cherries, raisins, bread crust, yeast, and cinnamon.

Really tasting dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee on the palette, along with the spices, licorice, and subtle vanilla most especially. Essentially follows the aroma. Body is medium-light."
1554,4.03,"Appearance is black, not quite pitch black; ruby red/dark brown highlights. The tan head is absurdly creamy and thick for what appeared to be low carbonation initially. Long-lasting retention and sheets of lacing.

On the nose I get lots of chocolate, a little bit of coffee and vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon or some vague spice note.

Chocolate dominates the palate, hitting upfront with hints of vanilla, dark brown bread in the middle, a touch of plum and balsamic vinegar, and maybe just a vague hint of generic spice. Finishes quick dry with a dusting more of cocoa powder, before finishing more abruptly than expected into cleanness.

The mouthfeel is medium, moderately carbonated, well carbonated and slightly pillow. Finishes crisper and lighter than expected, given the chewiness of the mid-palate.

...Overall, well a solid beer. I had to know idea what style of this beer was going in. I thought it was a Belgian dark ale and reviewed it as such! Surprise, surprise...well, it's pretty solid for a Euro black lager!"
1554,4,"Very scrappy notes from 2010. 6 pack from Surdyk's in NE Minneapolis.
12 ounce bottles. Poured into a pint glass.
Looks like a nice medium dark lager and has an 'old world' aroma. Smooth, creamy and dry with medium carbonation. Sweet chocolate and fairly malty. Very good tasting beer."
1554,4.26,"The beer pours dark brown with a creamy tan head. The head has real staying power!!!! Nice lacing. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt, and hint of banana. Taste is dark chocolate, cream, and picking up that slight hint of banana again. The mouthfeel is one of the best I have had. The bear is creamy and soft, almost the consistency of a melted milkshake. This is an outstanding beer! Nice job New Belgium!!"
1554,4.16,"Purchased as a 12-bottle variety pack from Sam's Club for $15.90. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Dark, molasses brown with a barely one-finger coffee brown head. Laces well.
S - Raisin, cacao, and dark breads. Slight ethanol.
T - Dark chocolate and stone fruit, washed over by pumpernickel and caramel. Light licorice and toffee finish. Not bitter in the slightest.
F - Sticky. Silky. Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Definitely on the heavier side.
O - A fantastic beer on its own, but even better when paired with steak! Great for a colder night. Couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, I'm afraid. Would highly recommend trying at least once. Will purchase again if I see it."
Citra,4.35,"16 ounce can into plastic hotel room cup at Tustin Inn. Canned on 3/17/22. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, blueberry, tangerine, red grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, bread dough, light honey/toast, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good sized pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Balanced creamy/grainy malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long resinous drying finish with mild astringency. Mild increasing warmth of 8.5%, a bit of hop burn. Super juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a good sized malt backbone. Top tier west coast style, aggressive yet smooth."
Citra,4.94,"Poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing. Taste is exactly what I hoped for—loads of delicious, dank citra! Mouthfeel is nice; has some rich gravity to it. I’m highly considering buying some more of this—very nice, delicious brew. Very strong on the citra hops and leans on the west coast IPA side, thankfully."
Citra,4.44,"Appearance - The beer poured a rusty yellow color with a visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - Citrus came though in the nose with a little bit of sweetness.

Taste - With a full body, the citra hops needed to be bold. In fact, they were bold. Unlike most citra hopped beers, this one leaned more bitter. It was dank, with notes of guava and lemon. The finish was warm and a bit of spice.

Mouthfeel - This was not a light beer. It had serious viscosity for the style with notable carbonation.

Overall - Citra hops went in a bit different direction in this beer. I liked it."
Citra,4.18,"Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and hint of piney, citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a balanced, old-school hoppy, slightly malty, and piney citrus bitter finish. This was a little more malt dominant than I was expecting, but still good!"
Citra,4.29,"Gold steering toward brown, white foam.

Face full of citra hops.

Not the east coast fruit bomb, this has a domineering earthy bent. Something close to cumin with more than notes of tangy pineapple and, much more so on the finish, orange.

Dry-ish and sharp-ish, sorta crackery. Notably softer when poured."
Citra,4.4,"Canned on 11/11/21; consumed on 11/19/21

Pours a foggy, bronze-tinted, rusty orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a finger of rich, creamy cap, equally rich collar lining the surface, and thick layers of webby lacing and spotty accessories spread across the entirety of the glass.

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.

Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.

Levels of resinous saturation bridge West Coast and New England IPA elements, bringing into focus advanced tropical fruit development born from an ultra-refined and raw hop core, and a deftly established malt profile; this is a measured intensity, and a deceptively potent variation of the WCIPA."
Citra,4.44,"2021 Vintage

Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber-yellow color with a fairly generous generous-sized thick, foamy white head that slowly faded. A nice looking IIPA for my tastes.

Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose.

Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA.

Overall: A great IIPA. A very good hop flavor profile with enough of a malt backbone to produce a good flavor profile. i wish I had a time machine so that I could decide if OG Nelson or Citra was/is my favorite IPA/IIPA."
Citra,4.86,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!
L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint.
S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect.
T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some.
F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time.
O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!"
Citra,4.74,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please."
Citra,4.77,Yummy!
Citra,4.46,"Pours a beautiful glowing copper, clear and clean. The aroma isn’t as big and vibrant as I might expect, but more subdued and muted. It’s bursting with flavor, all that citra goodness, with just enough heft and body on the back. I thought it was fantastic."
Raison D'Être,3.32,"This was deeply appealing by description. Not sure if it was the yeast or (maybe) bad bottle, but the stuff was kind of bitter and frankly a bit nasty. Scoring more objectively with benefit of the doubt."
Raison D'Être,3.03,"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV is 8%. Amber to copper colour, low head. Boring aroma, slightly malty. Malty flavour, notes of caramel, hints of cinnamon."
Raison D'Être,3.49,"32oz crowler purchased two days ago at J's Liquor Owensboro poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness."
Raison D'Être,4.03,"Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes."
Raison D'Être,4.48,"Why is this no longer available in Georgia. When craft beer and microbreweries first started to get popular in the metro Atlanta region back in the early 2000s, this was one of the very first beers that I saw from the movement. Certainly without a doubt the first Dogfish Head I ever saw. I haven't seen it 'round these parts in probably 13-14 years. Too bad becauise this is a really good one and I wish I could have one right now"
Raison D'Être,4,"I've had this. It makes me think of Shawn Gallagher's wedding. I went to visit Shawn and we stopped at Dogfish Brewery. Ah bliss, I was like a kid in a candy store. I have fond memories of Dogfish as it was the New Yorker article about Dogfish that got me into beer! As you can tell I am an Intellectual Aesthete"
Raison D'Être,3.94,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Clear brown/red hue.

Off-white head; nice lacing.

Cream soda, caramelized sugar & sweet malt nose. Unique.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Cream, caramelized sugar; sweet but not cloying. A unique, enjoyable beer; one is enough per session."
Raison D'Être,3.62,"From notes 8/10/12: Pours an almost clear reddish brown producing 3 fingers of tan, rapidly diminishing heat that leaves a dense and lasting surface cap but minimal lace. Aroma is sweet malty caramel, vanilla, hints of dark fruit, molasses with a small but detectable hop presence. Taste is less sweet than the promise of the nose: dark malt, fruity fruitcake, molasses and alcohol. Dry, peppery, lightly bitter and boozy in the finish and aftertaste."
Perpetual IPA,4.31,It says it’s an Imperial IPA- but I don’t really get the flavor I expected. Very sticky with pine resin and citrus. Very easy drinking and enjoyable. I honestly expected more pine and hop bitterness for an imperial. However- I really do like this. Another great offering from Troegs.
Perpetual IPA,3.53,"Did not impress as expected. Not much head after pour. First sip tasted more like a lager, then somewhat bitter. Agreeable overall though."
Perpetual IPA,3.54,Pours a clear gold. Thick foam. Light hoppy aroma. Heavy hop body. Strong bitterness. It persists. Kind of bland. Not a lot of character. Not bad but could be better.
Perpetual IPA,3.3,This just IBUS and literally nothing else going on. Feel is good and all but it tastes like bitter water. Bore snore.
Perpetual IPA,4.39,"Nothing mind blowing, but looks beautiful and has a memorable taste. Lacing is amazing when poured into IPA glass. A strong start to my variety pack-- very excited to see what else is offered. B+ rating."
Perpetual IPA,4.16,12 oz. bottle pour. Mostly clear golden yellow with a thin white head. The flavor is very hop-forward with a hint of malt sweetness. Overall an excellent example of the IPA style.
Perpetual IPA,4.1,"LOOK: Pours a very clear and bright gold with a slightly off white head. Retention was decent, slowly receding to a thin skin but retaining very solid side glass lace.
AROMA: Floral hops, citrus of mandarin orange, pine resin. Bread malts are also evident.
TASTE: Drying and some hop bitterness up front. Bread malts balance. Drying thru the finish.
Very solid, IPA"
Perpetual IPA,4.55,"Pours from can very clear, like apple juice. Head is almost the brightest white I have seen in a beer with nice lacing. Nose is piney and citrusy. Taste is at first just a typical IPA flavor, then the backbite hits with a bitterness that grabs the back sides of the tongue. Superb beer!"
Perpetual IPA,3.34,tad too much malt...
Perpetual IPA,4.07,"L: Pours a nice golden/copper with a finger and a half of fluffy white head
S: citrus rind, pine, bready/caramel malt
T: begins with a sweet citrus followed by medium pine and finishes with a solid caramel malt backbone
F: medium carbonation, medium body, dry
O: a good, quality IPA. Consistent"
Perpetual IPA,4.16,"Excellent beer! My only thing is it smells pretty funky. Other than that, super rich and complex taste. Beautiful harmony between the malt and hops, nice and clean feel. This well deserves a stand out spot up there in the ever expansive world of IPA's, and for all the right reasons. Perfection, take notes people"
Perpetual IPA,3.93,At the Philly airport.
Perpetual IPA,4.06,"I used to love this IPA. If fact, it was one of my favorite. But something has changed. It no longer has a ""Hop Forward"" style. Consequently it has a more noticeable malt taste. Along with the high ABV, the taste no longer has a WOW factor. Sad to see this once great beer for hop heads become what it has. Now I'll order other west coast IPAs instead."
Perpetual IPA,4.12,"Pours golden yellow with a 1.5"" white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.

Aroma is floral, pine, grapefruit, grass.

Excellent grapefruit & pine taste with underlaying notes of caramel. Resinous.

Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.

Another very good DIPA form Troegs."
Perpetual IPA,4.42,"Crystal clear golden color with a bone white head that laces the glass beautifully. The nose is straight citrus and resiny pine, definitely in the WCIPA style.

The taste has citrus up front, with grapefruit rind and ripe oranges, then the resiny pine closes the taste with a very nice bitter finish that is very dry.

This is the very definition of crushable and would always be in my beer fridge if I had regular access to it. Highly recommended if you like the WCIPA style, which I do."
Perpetual IPA,4.04,"Beautiful medium amber with a sticky, clotted head of white foam. Great lacing and persistence keeping the beer capped from beginning to end.
Hop aromas fill the room upon pouring. Grapefruit, lavender and sage mix with bread dough and honey in an inviting mix of smells that draw you in by the nose.
Light sugars up front are followed by sharp hop flavors of more citrus rind, bitterness comes in quickly washing most of the malt character and body away.
Highly attenuated and light on the tongue this is a hop showcase and offers only a hint of balance, but thats almost enough.
Very drinkable with a mild, lingering hop bite on the finish.
This is a weak Imperial IPA that lacks malt body,flavor and balance. It is in my opinion and decent IPA, as 7.5% is not quite Imperial level and the grain and malt presence is overshadowed sharp hop flavors .
Happy 4-20!"
Perpetual IPA,3.24,"Another variety pack for me and this one's first in line. It pours clear gold with minimal head. The smell is piney with minor citrus notes coming through. I'm not getting much citrus in the taste. It's very hop-forward with about 25% mild herbal hops and 75% pungent bitter hops. Clear appearance, but murky flavor. Very smooth and easy-drinking though."
Perpetual IPA,4.19,"The beer doesn't look notable in any particular way, but does not look bad. It is sweet, but dank and grassy and piney on the nose. The taste is bitter with a sweetness pooping in towards the end. The hops notes a very herbal, bright, and fresh with some dank. The mouthfeel is soft and foamy. it is pleasant. Overall, it s pretty good beer."
Perpetual IPA,4.17,"Best By 04/14/2021 Let warm for ~10 minutes, before opening.

Clear gold, with 1.5 fingers of medium-coarse ivory head, that leaves a few spots of lacing.

Smell is light pine, a vague citrusy mix, and a bit of (bread)crusty malt. Also some melon and pear from the open can. Smells good, but overall is a bit subdued.

Taste is mostly pine and grapefruit rind, with a little grass & green onion, and a light, helles-like, honey-on-toasted-grain element , near finish. Moderate bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, barely slick, with moderate, soft, semi-creamy carbonation, that finishes slightly drier, and with a mild bite on the tip of the tongue.

Overall , a pleasure. First time having this not-old, and won't be the last (I hope). An old(ish)-school type of IPA, but the feel of it pushes it above most. Dangerously easy-drinking. (On to #2 , as I'm typing this. ;) ) Give it a try if you like that sort of thing. :)"
Perpetual IPA,4.51,"this is my second favorite ipa next to dogfish head 90 minute . it's just as good except dogfidh head has a better mouth feel, a creamier feel. other than that troegss perp ipa is an Olympic gold metal winner with a perfect hoppy smell that beats better twice the price. i especially prefer the cans because they are never skunked. it tastes especially good in a regular 12oz beer glass whereas dfa 90s is better out of a beer snifter."
Perpetual IPA,2.29,"Served on tap at the local pub.

Appearance:
Plain, pilsner yellow with no head and limited lacing.
---
Bouquet:
Piney pineapple and semi-sweet malted citrus. An evocative, if underwhelming, combination.
---
Feel:
A nettle of pin-prick bubbles in a depressingly starved medium. Like drinking murky water with sand in it.
---
Taste:
Lemon pith and harsh grapefruit override any pine or malt offerings. Finishes with thin film of tomatoey bile. Gee, just what I always wanted. Watch out. Master craftsmen at work here.

Overall:
Don't believe the hype. It's about as impressive as stale bread."
Perpetual IPA,3.7,We
Perpetual IPA,4.17,"12 oz. bottle from Anthology Winter pack poured into a pint glass with a clear straw-golden color (more reminiscent of an AAL than an IPA) with a decent head and lacing. Aroma of pine, some citrus and hops. Taste follows aroma with grass, citrus, pine and lots of hops, hop bitterness balanced with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and a pleasant dry finish. Overall, a very tasty AIPA/DIPA!"
Perpetual IPA,4.55,"$2.00, 7.5%ABV, 12fl oz., No canned date, Freshest by Mar. 16th 2021, 46.0ºF (7.8ºC), 85 IBU, Pint glass

Overall: This beer is beautiful looking, the smell is absolutely great, the price is good, the taste is pretty bitter and has a great hop complexity I don't get much malty flavor. There was no explicit canned date which is disappointing, but it is definitely pretty fresh just going off the taste. I give it a 97 overall; really good."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.68,"I really like the Rodenbach Caractère Rouge, so I thought I'd give the Rodenbach Alexander a try.

Look – Looks a lot like the Caractère Rouge, with just a bit more head. A beautiful clear amber red with a head that doesn't last very long.

Smell – A nice cherry scent, that isn't overly sour. Also oak and Flanders' funk. This smells really nice!

Taste – The taste is very much like the smell. Not sour at all. In fact, this is the first sour that I think could use just a bit more sourness, though I much prefer this to overly sour sours. A bit dry, but very good.

Feel – A nice carbonation. Very easy to drink.

Overall – This is another great beer from Rodenbach. I'm generally not a huge fan of this style of beer because it's usually too sour for my liking, but this one is nice."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.5,"Murky reddish brown with a little, fast fading head.

Smells of musky oak, apple cider vinegar, dusty cellar, and balsamic.

The taste follows the nose, but is a balance of puckering sour and sweetness. Cherries are in there as well.

Thick and acidic, somewhat woody texture with moderate to low carbonation.

I got this a long time ago, somewhere in North America, probably the USA, likely California. Brought it to Phuket with me over 18 months ago, where I’m drinking during our second Covid quarantine, June 21st, 2022. Great brew, survived a lot, but not this time of isolation!"
Rodenbach Alexander,4.49,"Cloudy sark red,brown,cranberry appearance.
Plenty of effervescent champagne like carbonation with maybe just a hair above average body.
Aroma is fresh black cherries,cherry juice,red wine,vinegar,wood,earthy bread..
Flavor is sweeter than expected but definitely is sour along with tartness and a little funk.. similar to aroma but its dryer than expected but very pleasant.
Overall this is an excellent top notch beer that even if you don't like sour beer this might still be enjoyable"
Rodenbach Alexander,4.28,"750ml bottle into a teku. Bottled 9!14/19, so over 2 1/2 years old.

Body looks good, clear dark red wine color. Smally bubbly head disappears quickly.

Decent sour aroma with some cherry and oak notes.

Delightful tasting beer. Sweet, tart, & sour notes mesh beautifully. Faint oak notes, sour cherry a bit more prominent.

Mouth medium, finish lightly sour and a touch drying.

Overall, nicely crafted and quite easy drinking. Great balance between sweet and sour, tartness more pronounced."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.74,Somewhat like a Kasteel Rogue but better. Not too much cherry but definitely enough cherry to taste it. Enough other things going to make it additionally complex. Worth finding and buying an excessive amount of it
Rodenbach Alexander,4.46,"Pours a muddy, near opaque, burgundy-brown with a berry hue to it. Head is a couple fingers of off-white foam. Aroma is cherries right off the bat. They're ripe, semi-sweet, with a funky, tart after taste. Oak, earthy malts, vinegar, and stone fit in behind cherries, but cherries steal the show. There is a brief hint of yeast esters, adding a little further sweetness to the total. Acidity is kept in check, countered by the bold, thick cherries.

Flavor profile is still cherry led, but it diverts to more of a twangy, funky, sour profile. Despite this funky finish, the cherries lead a sugary sweet start. These cherries lean into a fleshy, fruity taste, alongside black cherry. Stone, grass, earthy malts, and oak fill in the gaps, but make no mistake, this is The Cherry show. Sourness is very light, creating just enough to cause a minor and brief jaw twinge of tightness, and then lets the palate and tension go. Acidity starts to accelerate about half way through each sip, building to the finish, although it's kept within balance of the beer.

Mouth feel has a velvety effervescence, that is to say, tight bubbles that come across consistent and constant. Thickness is medium. Overall, this is an incredibly well done Flanders Red Ale, or ""sour"". It's got just enough lactic sour twist at the end to create contrast, and give it the 'sour' moniker, but not enough to distort the tongue, or wreck the palate. Cherries are just divine here.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 11.2oz bottle."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.74,I'm gonna be brief. I hate sours. I love this. Nuff said.
Rodenbach Alexander,4.12,"great use of cherry, the sweetness nicely cuts the serious acidity of the beer, salty, vinegar, wood, red wine, some brown bread, lovely levels of sourness, no real bitterness to report, medium bodied, highly carbonated, dry, not quite as nice as the grand cru in my opinion but still a very nice beer, need to get my hands on the caractère rouge now"
Rodenbach Alexander,4.26,"11.2 oz bottle served in a beer goblet.
Appearance. Clear brownish and orangish red body with a very durable off-white head that displays a touch of pink.
Mouthfeel. Excellent! Smooth with seemingly perfect carbonation.
Aroma. Fruity with a clear cherry note. There's a hint of oak and a faint suggestion of vinegar.
Flavor. Wow. Pretty amazing and balanced mix of sweet and tart, both at relatively high levels. Plenty of sweet and sour cherry notes with numerous minor notes that heighten interest and complexity."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.45,"Right from the pour there is an apple cider vinegar aroma. The smell is a bit more sweet than the normal vinegar scent. The look is similar to an amber which makes sense because of the cherries. There is a bit of a tart taste at the beginning with high carbonation. This is a good beer with a great taste. The flavor profile is clean and transitions well from the front to back. There is a tart, clean, and final sweet taste. Definitely a beer I'd drink again and would share as a recommendation for sours."
Rodenbach Alexander,3.03,"Plain and simple: this beer doesn’t vibe with Raul (or vice versa). It pretty much tastes like cough syrup to me. Good and smooth cough syrup, but cough syrup. Think of a liquid Flinstones vitamin that’s organic."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.6,"Appearance: Pours a clear russet brown ruby highlights; the head builds to three fingers and has a slight orange tint; streaks and squiggles of lacing

Smell: Sour cherry, oak and vanilla; hints of caramel and chocolate

Taste: There is a really interesting blend of the fresh sweet cherry and deeply complex oak/vanilla/sour cherry that sways back and forth across the tastebuds; hints of chocolate and caramel; the finish is tart but there is some residual sweetness to complement

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate to high carbonation

Overall: This is really good and l love the contrasting elements"
Rodenbach Alexander,4.51,"Review 1512
I am hoping to finish my night with an awesome beer. I have seen this beer time and time again, I have never picked it up until today. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a light tan one-fingered head. The retention of the head is excellent and left some lacing on the glass; furthermore, the head is rocky, billowy, and creamy.
The color is a reddish mahogany hue, probably from the cherries in the beer. The beer is clear with some carbonation activity. The beer is beautiful. Looking forward to consuming it.

Initial aromas in the beer are cherries, vinegar ( in a good way), oak, and fruity sweetness. Nosing further I smell, cereal grains, lemons, oak, earthiness, and some floral esters.

The flavors in the beer are cherries, lemons, sourness (acidic vinegar-like), fruity sweetness, floral esters, earthiness, oak, lightly, and toasted malts.

The body of the beer is tart and bright.

The mouthfeel of the beer is light, medium carbonation, and full finish.

This beer is amazing. I can not believe I did not drink this beer before today. I love this beer it bright, tarty, and flavorful. I could drink this beer all the time. This beer will be my staple beer."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.24,"Bottled: 06/20/17

L: Pours a deep amber to amber brown with good clarity. A gentle pour results in a nice finger of rouge head that quickly falls to a 2 mm ring around the glass leaving no lacing as the beer recedes.

S: Cherries, red wine vinegar, a hint of acidity, and just the lightest note of oak (barley perceptible on first pour but becomes more apparent as the beer warms). The nose is dominated by cherry, seems a bit faded, and lacks the complexity of the palate.

T: Waves of sweet cherry and maybe some notes of sweet red grape on the front end flowing into the mid palate where there are some earthy tobacco notes. The back end presents a light spiciness, a note of woody funk, and a gentle sourness that balances out the preceding sweetness.

F: I get a medium body with carbonation on the low side of medium but still imparting a bit of zippiness. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel that becomes more syrupy as the beer warms. The finish has a light vinous quality and a bit of dryness.

O: I am not sure what the suggested serving temp is for Alexander, but in my opinion the complexity of the palate fully revealed itself once the beer had had a good 10 to 15 minutes in the glass from fridge temp. On the other hand the mouthfeel loses it's gentle creaminess and zip as the beer warms. I would love to try a fresher version of this as I felt the 3.75 years age negatively impacted the beer a bit: especially the nose, but also the palate slightly. Even edging up on 4 years old this is still a great beer which is a testament to the skill of the brewers. Recommended."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.68,"Always exciting to pick up a world class beer at the LCBO in Ontario. Mostly because it happens too infrequently IMHO. This slightly cloudy ruby red beauty smells of cherry and vanilla atop a slightly vinegar backdrop. The blend of the tart sour and sweet cherries is divine. Wow, that is smooth. Vanilla and oak finish. Heavenly."
Rodenbach Alexander,4.43,Excellent interplay of sweet meets sour; creating an almost umami flavor. Good amount of funk/horse-blanket that is enveloped by lovely crisp cherry. Great beer! Do wish it was just a touch more tart...otherwise incredible. So happy to find this in 4-pack bottles.
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.34,"Pours slightly cloudy and bright yellow with with a lot of brut fizz that lingers. Mild aromas of grass, gym socks, fruitiness, hot concrete when the rain hits. The flavor reflect the aromas, but possibly even more mildly. Fruitiness is more up front, followed by fauna, and a friendly brut dryness. A very elegant beer."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.18,"750ml bottle into a champagne glass. 2015 vintage, so 6 years old.

Looking very good in the tall glass. Glassy apple juice colored body. Carbonation present every pour, fizzy and sparkling.

Very floral aroma, but pleasant not suffocating.

On tasting, floral, slightly fruity, a hint of spice, and quite drying.

Mouth above medium, finish is the only place abv is felt. Quite warming.

Overall, excellent dinner beer. Was a bit shocked by the abv, would have guessed half that from the taste. A lot of work goes into producing this beer, much appreciated by this palate."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.15,"2021-11-27
750ml corked/caged bottle served in a slightly tulippy stemmed glass. Cuvee Prestige 2017.

Pours clear, very light copper, big head, TONS of carbonation, sustaining a large head and clearly visible from a distance. Smell is mostly funky / yeasty, maybe some grape must, maybe some peach.

Taste is in the same theme, but not the same balance. Definitely some funk, but a candy sweetness offsets it. Definitely some yeastiness, but twisted a little toward earthiness. I think the peach stands up and maybe is a little accentuated.

Mouthfeel is, of course, light, dry, and exceedingly effervescent. Overall...this is the only beer of the style that I've had so I cannot profess that it's great or terrible relative to the style, but it is a clean, interesting, and very tasty beer that is quite different than the many others I have tried."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4,"Shared bottle at RBNAG 2011, as Deus Brut des Flandres Cuvée Prestige 2010. Clear and sparkling straw coloured beer. Dryish aroma, moderate but very pleasant farmhouse notes. Very dry and crisp flavour, no doubt a fine beer, but is it worth the high price?"
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.34,"This is my beer to celebrate the demise of 2020 and hope for a better 2021! I bought this at Susan’s Wine Shop in Santa Fe, NM.

The cork popped enthusiastically and the foam came forth! Poured into a tulip glass. Bright clear yellow color with luxurious white foamy head and excellent curtain lacing. Sweet champagne smell and taste. Candied lemon, vanilla, and cinnamon and other warm spices. Truly a treat. Cheers!

( Couldn’t get my mother in law to try it!)"
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.37,"2010 vintage, enjoyed on 10/15/2020."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.36,"2016 edition. Pours a straw colour with a nice sheen. Smells like faint banana and allspice, green apple peel, and un-ripened pears, and a touch of meadowsweet. Tastes very effervescent; champagne yeasts, pear, elderflower, woodbine nectar, and touches of allspice, nutmeg and Belgian yeasts. clean semi-dry finish."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),3.92,"Pours a cloudy golden color. Incredibly effervescent even after sitting for a while. Thick frothy white head collapses inward leaving a thin layer of foam fed by the constant rising bubbles from the bottom of the champagne glass. Given plenty of time to sit, the beer does clear up as the yeast particles sink to the bottom. Never completely clear, but certainly much clearer.

Aroma is interesting - it has light floral and fruity notes with a distinct spiciness to it. Some spicy esters come through especially as it warms.

Taste follows the nose with herbal and floral notes and a distinct spicy ester. Touch of mint. The interplay does have some lemon citrus notes that coupled with the spiciness comes across like lemon-pepper spice. Bitterness starts on the back end and continues into the finish.

Feel is light, bright and vivacious. Sprightly carbonation. Dry finish. Pretty much what you'd expect from the style.

Overall this is a really unique beer. Id need to have more traditional Belgian examples to really know how this hold up against other examples of the style. On its own merits, I thought the spicy esters were too prominent, and wanted a bit more balance overall. Still, it was a good beer and one I was glad to get the chance to try."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4.67,"A fantastic, light Belgian beer."
DeuS (Brut Des Flandres),4,"From the front label: ""Cuvée Prestige 2010""
The bottle was chilled according to the pamphlet that was attached to the neck.

Appearance: The body is a light gold color which is moderately hazy. It has loads of carbonation bubbles. The head starts out very large and white but quickly fizzes out to a short cap on the surface.

Aroma: The beer has a light herbal aroma with just a touch of bubblegum. The longer the nose is spent near the glass the more it takes on this floral note. After a bit longer it even starts to take on some slightly fruity aromas with a nice caramel scent. It smells a lot better and has much more character as it sits in the glass a bit. I would recommend at least ten minutes for it to really open up.

Taste; Up front there is this sweet caramel flavor mixed with a touch of tea leaf. The flavor rolls off the tongue and fades to near nothing. The finish has this nice floral character with a touch of bitterness. Oddly, after sitting for a while there is this slight flavor of what kind-of tastes like lemon pepper.

Mouthfeel: It is heavily carbonated and it fizzes very lively across the palate. The beer starts with a semi-sweet character and lightens as the carbonation draws itself across the palate.

Overall: It's a very interesting beer. The aroma, flavor of the beer all started off feeling rather average but then the intricacies of its delicate nature started to show. In the aroma department it slowly builds a nice bouquet that becomes pleasant over time. The flavor of the beer starts out a bit simple and sweet but slowly begins to become more floral and a bit herbal. One of the strongest elements of the beer is its ""Belgian yeast character"" which seems to contribute a lot to its aroma and flavor. I would recommend this beer to anyone who really enjoys lighter Belgian beers and I would drink it again."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,"I didnt think i was going to give it a perfect score but..... Its looks, smells, tastes, a 5, HOWEVER, the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE. Pardon me i have to sit down. Mouth feel is, well 11. Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'. It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,3.79,"So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”
Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?
So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.
The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.
After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.
Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.
Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.64,"2021 vintage, bottle #79

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?

Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing

The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon

Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness

I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.27,"Celebrating my buddy @Rug with his 1,000th beer review. Pours an almost perfect black with no head. Smells lightly of maple syrup and chocolate. With the first sip I immediately tasted chocolate and caramel followed by a maple syrup finish. The syrup flavor lingers. The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint. Overall great beer and I’m glad I got to crack it open with my bud."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.79,"Thick and syrupy pour, mocha head. Aroma is boozy maple, bittersweet chocolate.
Lived up to my expectations and very happy to try.
Mouthfeel was heavy, syrupy, smooth with light carbonation.
Nice barrel presence and all the flavors blend together neatly."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,Had a big share and this was by far the best stout
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.73,"Look - fantastic black and thick with a great tan head
Smell - maple and barrel
Taste - great maple coffee barrel taste
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - incredible but for the hype, to much maple"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.96,"Initial nose is beautiful maple! The taste is nice barrel, maple, coffee and chocolate. This is very rich and overall deserving of the high ratings. The only slight knock on this beer is viscosity."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.23,"A: Nightfall in appearance that presents a class, of shades, within the Bearded Iris: Before the Storm. Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission

S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins

T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions

M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques

O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.64,Thanks for the pour Azuelke!
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.59,Lots of maple and coffee notes. Mild barrel presence.
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.49,"Draft pour at TG.

Pitch black with no head. Not too thick. At the nose is heavy maple with some coffee. I didn’t really pick up any barrels though. The taste is likewise the same, heavy maple with coffee and chocolate. Very little barrel as it warmed. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thin nor too thick. Overall: a standard BA breakfast stout. Great beer overall but over hyped with ridiculous pricing. Glad I had a draft pour which cost less per oz than the bottle. It seems to me it’s almost the same as Mornin Delight."
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.9,"2020 vintage drank 10/22/21
Incredible smell as soon as bottle was opened. Rich maple, chocolate, syrup breakfast in a glass. Incredibly smooth. Not a ton of bourbon flavor, and no alcohol burn. Not as thick as some TG stouts like assassin, but still an incredible beer and glad I chased it. Definitely one of the best"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,5,2020 vintage acquired during the pandemic. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and worth the drive to track it down. Wonderful aroma and such a smooth taste. Very few live up to the hype but this one did.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,4.56,"Long time waiting to tick this one, and I have to say - pretty underwhelmed. Its delicious as far as maple syrup goes, but overall it was lacking in complexity. Barrel was light and not much else. Nice mouth feel and long finish."

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.38,500 ml bottle. Smell and look make this beer. Perfect for an all day brisket smoking session.
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.55,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear mahogany, with a three-finger fluffy pale tan head.
S - Smoke comes through extremely well. Oak. Brown bread.
T - The malty smokiness hits me like a bus! Lightly-roasted coffee. Brown bread. Dark toffee on the smokey finish. Definitely on the maltier side, but it isn't sweet at all.
F - Medium-full in body, with decent carbonation. Filling, but easy-to-drink.
O - I've had this beer only once before, and it's exactly how I remembered it! Sort of reminds one of drinking bacon, sans the pork flavor (if you haven't had this before). Super malty, super smokey, and tons of flavor. What's there not to like? Highly recommend!"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.46,"Appearance: Pours coffee colored with a two finger ecru head; solid retention and shards of lace remain

Smell: Lightly smoked malt, toasted brown bread and caramel

Taste: Caramel and toasted brown bread forward with the smoked malt flavors building rapidly; a meaty element arrives, after the swallow, but is offset by the sweeter tones detected on the front end

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation

Overall: The smoke element here is deftly handled and I really enjoy the way it melds with the sweeter malts"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,5,"A moderate pour released a fat finger of tan creamy foam which sunk to a rocky head. Sticky lacing surrounds the glass.
Clear dark brown color with fiery ruby highlights.

Bold smell of smoked ham and bacon, dark bready malt and raisins

Smokey, meaty taste that is right on the line of sweet and dry. Moderate bitterness at first that comes from smoked malt, hops are present yet indistinguishable to me. The smoke is mellow, reminds me of standing near a BBQ smoker and burning wet wood. Raisin and baked stone fruits almost add sweetness. The finish is quick, but the smoked meat taste lingers on. Bitterness builds a bit as it becomes semi-dry.

Medium-full bodied with soft lasting carbonation. Very smooth and balanced despite the smoke. Malty like Scotch Ale.
Big flavor similar to Baltic Porter. Higher than average bitterness for Lager, however this is no ordinary Lager. This is one of the best Beers I've tried so far."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.52,"Very dark brown with ruby red highlights. Topped with a fine cap of chunky tan foam.

Smells like bacon and roast beef and campfire smoke! Slightly salty, very meaty and smoky. Roasted barley and fresh wood chunks.

Bacon and ham upfront, chocolate and caramel leading into bread crust, salt, root beer/cola, honey, and pepper. The chocolate sweetness and hammy smoke lingers!

Rich mouthfeel, coats the palate but is still pretty clean.

Wow, a wonderful Rauchbier. This is fantastic."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.59,".5 L bottle
Glass: 0.4 L Tulip (from Troegs)

Look: Deep brown with dark ruby highlights with held to a light. Opaque in the glass that I used (this tulip is wider than most). Initial 2+ finger beige head dissipates quickly to a thin layer. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Wow. Smoked ham and kielbasi. Bacon. Brown sugar and some dark honey. Toasted dark bread such as pumpernickel. The smoke is absolutely there and dominant but melds wonderfully well with the malts and the sweetness. I could almost just sit here and enjoy the aroma. Almost.

Taste: Smoke leads off (of course). Malty smoked meats transition to a smokey toasted caramel with chocolate notes. Some campfire appears. Dries out towards the finish but still smokey-sweet. Just like the aroma, everything here melds together very well.

Feel: Medium body with a slight lean towards the thinner side. Smooth. Slightly creamy.

Overall: Very well done and complex Rauchbier. And a very well done bock. A good companion on a chilly rainy or snowy night. And for watching episodes of shows like The Last Kingdom, Vikings Valhalla, or House of the Dragon (when that comes out)."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.57,"Excellent beer for food pairings. Well carbed, dark bitter malt, smoked ham, campfire, bock sweetness. I'd call this and the Marzen the standard bearers for the style. Aecht Schlenkerla can do no wrong in my eyes."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.58,"Refrigerated glass bottle poured into a glass stein.
Deep, dark amber like root beer candy with a light tan head. Darker than I expected.
Smoky sweet reminiscent of a scotch ale but with an integral character and a finish that goes on forever.
Lovely brew. Craving a second."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.63,"Im still super new to this style as a whole but I adore this so far, deep brown red appearance with a great smoke flavor that isn't overbearing. Trying to not smash the whole glass in ten seconds"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.17,"500ml bottle into a pint glass. NO freshness dating.

Looking very nice in the glass. Darkest brown body with some amber highlights. Small off white head shrinks to a fat collar and covering, leaving rings of lacing.

Sweet malty smoky aroma with a little ham.

On tasting, full flavored, a little sweeter and meatier than the Marzen version. Smoke malt use is again superbly balanced so as not to overwhelm the base beer. A hint of bitterness on the back end.

Mouth very close to full, finish a progression of sweet/smoke/light bitterness.

Overall, if you enjoy or want to try smoke beers, this is the brewery to seek out. Masters of their craft."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.1,"Pours very dark brown with red highlights, with a modest tan head that lingers well. Excellent lacing.

Aromas of old smoke, tobacco, toasted bread, faint dark fruits.

Caramel and toasted malts on the tip of the tongue. Plenty of savory smoke in midstream. Straight out smokehouse goodness. There is some subtle earthy/grassy hop lurking in the background. The brew trends somewhat sweeter as it warms, but maintains a solid savory quality.

Medium bodied, smooth, and decently carbonated, with a drying finish.

Another excellent Rauchbier from these folks."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.34,"L: deep reddish brown with a small khaki head.
S: refreshing pine, Scotch whisky, tar, and wood stove.
T: caramel, pine, rich malt, and a little dry at the end.

This is my first ever rauchbier and I'm intrigued. Excellent beer, delicious."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.85,"16.9oz bottle into a .25L Schlenkerla tasting glass.
L: Pours a med-dark brown with a ruby toned base. 2 finger creamy pockmarked light beige head with good retention to a thick skin. Some sticky lacing and banding dependent upon drinking time spent. Light but visible carbonation.
S: Smoky toasted caramelized malts, dark moist brown bread, leather, lightly floral with a hint of cedar wood.
T: Caramelized chocolate malts, smoked grains interspersed throughout, suggestions of smoked baby lace swiss cheese with subtle hints of smoked meat namely pork. A touch of hop bitterness and very light citrus zest flow throughout along side raisins and figs. It is moderately sweet and is gently drying within the finish. There is light cedar resin.
F: An effectively ornamented clean med-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a brisk start, a slightly dense, smooth creamy central axis and a semi-sticky colorful finish.
O: An incredible tasting rauchbier. Sensuously crafted & smoked, there's nothing else quite like it. In the realm of smoked beers it is world-class. Compared to it's brothers Marzen and Eiche rauchbiers: Urbock has a bit more depth in flavor than the Marzen and the Urbock it is not as sweet as Eiche which notably has a different wood smoke taste. All are world-class."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.52,"Poured bottle into shaker pint. Deep dark brown with a cream nice colored. Great looking beer.

Nose is smoked Gouda with an underlying sweetness.

Taste follows: smoky sweet Caramel malt, bit of dark dried fruit.

Feel is light, sweet on the edge of the mouth, medium.

A bocky rauchbier for sure. Really good looking. Jerky in syrup."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.65,"L: Dark body, tan lasting head, moderate lacing.
A: Malty smoky aroma. Fairly strong.
T: Savory taste, like a malty brisket to start. Finishes with a creamy malty backbone that leaves smoke.
F: high/ medium feel, not much carbonation but it isn’t needed. Creamy and a little syrupy. Fuller body brew.
O: a great smoky boch. Any person who likes dark brews would be well served to try this. Once the weather cools a bit I’m sure it will serve the winter months well."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,3.99,"Pours dark brown, nearly black with ample tan head. Smell and taste are dominated by smoke. A bit of a sweet caramel malt backbone, with some dark fruit. Light and easy drinking for such a dark beer. A bit thin. Overall this is all about the smoke and the malt. The smokiness is a bit aggressive, but oddly addictive."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.39,"Ever since I’ve had their Rauchbier Marzen I’ve been on the hunt for all the other variants. We’re moving up, as this is the second highest rated beer in the style. I love Rauchbiers of any kind, but these guys set the bars high with the last one. Let’s see where this one falls

Pours almost completely jet black with a thick finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose on this one really goes beyond the smoke, with much more depth than I expected. I’m picking up on aromas of campfire smoke, rich toffee, earthy hops, dark toast, and brown sugar

Just as the aroma suggested, this has a crazy depth in flavor unlike any Rauchbier I’ve had before, but more so up front. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark bread, earthy hops, smokey oak, raisin, light pepper, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of campfire smoke, dark doughy malt, toasted grain, and medium roast coffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a velvety smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a light bitterness

Yet another incredible beer from these guys. I could toss back a whole case of this. Drinks a lot lighter than the 6.6% it is, but the depth of flavor suggests even higher abv which is weird. Either way, incredible"
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.48,"Not quite dull black, the body's appearance is more a uniformly muddled mahogany brown under a tall fluffy tan head that collapses to an unevenly bubbly, fuzzy sponge collar leaving spotty lacing on the glass.

Like the label says, it certainly is sweet and smoky, but it's even smokier than their marzen. That said, relative to the many ostentatiously smoked beers I’ve had stateside, it's still tolerable, and it’s also got this unique character to it I’m having a hard time putting my finger on.

Up front is a sort of spicy smoke, where the thinner body enhances splintery characteristics. The fine, thin carbonation quickly runs into a semi-dry finish where a sort of toasted darker bread element emerges in conjunction with a sweet sort of macadamia-like nut, or maybe even a hint of amaretto.

The savory flavors are so satisfying, actually, that they've got me craving them as I step away to do other things--it doesn't give off that gut bomb of umami that some ultra savory beers trigger in me--it’s actually a refreshing sort of smokiness, which is hard to explain. It's a sort of a dark honey or molasses, but not quite. It may be better described as gingersnaps with mildly burnt bottoms."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.5,"Pours a dark mahogany with a thick tan head that lingers and good lacing.

Taste sweet smoky malt up front with a hint of bakers chocolate and leather with some sweet caramel mixed in. Medium feel and lingering aftertaste. A good one to enjoy."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.3,"L: Foggy purple brown body, paper white head.
S: Sweet and cool. Dark fruits; plum, raisin, wine grapes. Hints of spice and honey.
T: Very rich. Upfront a bit of tart cherry and grapes, cloves, some root beer, then raisin and dates, then huge spicy cinnamon notes.
F: Extremely soft and creamy, perhaps more so than any beer I’ve tried. Very warm as well.
O: Fantastic. Spicy, creamy, rich, warm. This is the perfect cold winter day beer."
Aventinus Eisbock,3.64,"Pours a ruby garnet color with a khaki head. Smell has dark fruits biscuit malts Taste is very malty with some dark fruits fig and dates , toasty with caramel and more malt. Mouth feel was smooth and creamy to me but boozy in the finish."
Aventinus Eisbock,2.44,"I am not a fan of eisbocks so I didn’t personally enjoy this beer, however the taste is interesting - it has somewhat of a sweet, toasted undertone to it. Very smooth."
Aventinus Eisbock,3.97,"I really wanted to like this beer. Maybe I've not had enough German beers and to many Belgians, but it was only a good beer. It wasn't a great beer. I still enjoyed it, and it really did get the job done in terms of alcohol level, but it wasn't the life-changing experience I was expecting"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.73,one of the great beers of the world- love everything from this brewery - it was great to drink a beer that tastes slihghtly stong with great maltyness and a flavoor you taste even after your finished
Aventinus Eisbock,4.36,"L: khaki head that very quickly dissipates between thirty seconds and two minutes, very deep brown yet transparent body
S: quite complex, wine yeast, malt, cherries, maple syrup, and beef
T: bread, maraschino cherries, and somehow both dry and sweet and sour
F: pretty good carbonation

A quite nuanced beer with loads of different smells and flavors. Almost no alcohol bite, very surprisingly tame for a 12% beer. Definitely would buy again."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.32,"L - Poured a semi-opaque ruby dark brown with a one-finger tan fizzy head that left a thin film. No lacing.
S - Faint caramel, malt and dark fruit soaked in booze.
T - Deep malt flavor with brown sugar, cinnamon and some dark fruit. Slightly sweet and boozy.
F - Moderate body and light carbonation. A bit more watery than what I expected. The caramel, malt and booziness lingers forever.
O - This is a very good and dangerous. It is light enough that it does not fill you up like a stout but the ABV is right up there so watch out!"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.82,"Updated (Current) review for 'standard' bottling of Aventinus Eisbock:

0.33 L bottle
Bottle Date: 21.210 and 160721 (guessing 16 July, 2021)
Consumed on: 2022-mar-29
Glass: 0.33L Schneider Aventinus Eisbock Vase
Pouring Temp: room temp (approx 71 F)

Look:
Opaque chestnut brown with a 1 and a half finger creamy beige head. I cannot see my fingers through the glass; at the narrow point(s), I might be able to see the shadow of my fingers if I hold the glass to a light. The head settles to a 1/4"" complete covering that has outstanding lacing. When I opened the bottle, the head appeared in the bottle and was slowly pushing itself up before I started pouring.

Smell:
Ripe bananas. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried dark fruit. Dark wheat malts, like whole wheat bread. (Dark) brown sugar. Noticeable cloves with some cinnamon and maybe nutmeg.

Taste:
The ripe fruits lead off with the brown sugar and the cinnamon and create a richness that persists through the sip. Cloves quickly join the ensemble and keep the sweetness in check. The cloves increase as one drinks more and more of this wonderful ale. A malty undertone ties everything together. No harshness nor booziness from the alcohol.

Feel:
Slick and mouth-coating. Some tingly carbonation. Medium-heavy body. A nice alcohol warmth is present and grows over time.

Overall:
A wonderful beer. This is unbelievably smooth for such a high ABV and is also complex and packed full of flavor. A very nice sipper for a cold night by the fire.

The pre-Eisbock base of Aventinus can be perceived, but this is a different animal.

Original review for for the Vintage 2016 bottling of Aventinus Eisbock.


look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 | overall: 4.5
Combo: 4.62

Bottle Date: Vintage 2016
Consumed on: 03-12-2022
Glass: Snifter
Pouring Temp: room temp (approx 71 F)

Look:
Opaque chestnut brown with very little head. What head there is disappears quickly. The condition of the head is most likely the result of the high ABV combined with the age of this beer (5-6 years)

Smell:
Intense ripe bananas and plums plus other dark fruits such as cherries and currants. Richly sweet. Some brown sugar. Mild cloves, cinnamon, and some nutmeg underlie these.

Taste:
Cloves and cinnamon start then meld in with ripe and rich dark fruits. There is a malty undertone that keeps things tied together well. The alcohol is noticeable but not near what one would expect for a beer of this ABV. What the alcohol does do is provide is nice warmth without any bite or harsh notes.

Feel:
Slick and mouth-coating. Body is medium-heavy.

Overall:
A wonderful beer. This is insanely smooth for such a high ABV and yet is also complex and packed full of flavor. The beer does bear some resemblance to a strong Belgian such as Rochefort 10 (a Quad). Absolutely recommended."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.27,"A warm, wonderful, slightly boozy, malty, sweet very tasty beer. Surprised I had not reviewed it before!
Poured from a bottle into a a tall tulip glass. Mahogany brown color with a creamy beige head and nice curtain lacing. Sweet caramel smell and taste. Dark fruit and warm spices. Smooth liquor feel. I wish I had another bottle!

Glad this was my 2500th beer review."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.52,"330 ml bottle poured into a tulip.

Pouring clear and colored deep copper/brown when held to the light. The half inch khaki head seems rather persistent for 12% ABV fading in about a minute to a perpetual but spotty cap . The nose is moderately strong, rich and sugary. Dried fruit, caramel and molasses come to mind. The taste is rich, malty and sweet with the same sugary caramel, molasses and dark fruit profile as the nose and a short sweet alcohol finish. It is not cloying, nor is the alcohol flavor harsh or boozy. Mouthfeel is smooth and full with low carbonation and softly warming until the bottom of the glass where the alcohol picks up a bit.

This drinks very fast and easy for a 12% sweet and malty beer. Very nice!"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.35,"Pours a hazy dark brown with a tall stiff fluffy head and a lot of lacing.

Smells of bread, yeast and spice.

Tastes of tangy wheat malt, bread, yeast, raisins, banana, caramel and coriander with a slightly bitter and hot alcohol finish.

Medium body with light carbonation. Lightly lush and syrupy mouthfeel.

This brew is an intense experience. I have reviewed 15 or so beers with higher ABV's than this one. This one has the most obvious alcohol presence in its taste of all of them. That said toward the end of a now warmer glass , with a deadened tongue , the other rich flavors come forward. This is not your every day sipper but should be one to be sought out and experienced at least once!"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.12,"Dirty brown color, murky; fat, coarse carbonation; fizzy head, initially tall yet quickly fizzes away to a few skimpy patches of foam. Huge aroma; spicy; anise and licorice; raisins. Malty, spicy flavors; mild to moderate caramel; anise and raisins; boozy phenols. Medium-heavy body with slick, watery feel; alcohol heat on the palate; slightly sticky.

One certainly senses the high ABV of this beer. The malt / wheat base adds some nice flavor components. The lack of any lasting head is a small disappointment, but the flavor and aroma intensity makes up for this.

Pouring temperature: 47.1 ℉; bottling data: 14.10.2024 2927091019"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.34,"A beer that I definitely should have had after the original Aventinus, but that’s okay. Pours a cloudy, deep chestnut brown. Two inch head that disappears after a few minutes

Intense aromas, strong hefe/wheat notes that are intensified, more toasty and caramel smells in here. Spices and molasses, some desert smells not unlike rum raisin cake or toffee.

A nice alcohol warmness without any harshness whatsoever belies a roasted caramel apple flavour. Wheat and malty notes make up the backbone. Initial flavour is a walloping that slowly eases into a long finish that might even be the absolute mildest of smoky — though I think it might be the alcohol at play giving me that feeling. Powerful toffee and caramel flavours as well. Typical dark cherry, plum, raisin like tastes as well. Nice gentle spices, mostly cloves but a sweet character of the beer gives mild cinnamon notes as well.

Smooth beer that finishes sweet with a medium body, is oh-so-gently prickly at first sip before it coalesces into a creamy character. Complex, spicy, sweet; all flavours intensify as it warms.

You know you have a good beer when you pop it open, drink it, and go ‘oh no’! Mostly because I only bought three at my LCBO. Liquor is controlled in Ontario so we are at the mercy of whatever some random dude ordering it wants. Picked up three at the only LCBO in all of Ontario that carries this an hour from my house. I wish I got at least 5 or 6 of them. Overall, great beer that I’m sure takes the strongest notes of the original Aventinus and intensifies them. (EDIT: Drove back, now I have 7 in my cellar. Yay!)

12% is perfect for nights like tonight, as Russia encloses on Kyiv, I take the bottle and I tip it to all the Ukrainian heroes that have passed. Alas, you have left us but your stories they will last!"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.02,"Wow what a beer. Amazing color, perfect foam, that stays for al long time. It smells like roasted malts but it taste like caramel. Hints of chocolate and toffee. Not like other eisbocks, they tast all sweet. It is boozy but 12%?"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.41,"This should be rated higher. Appearance is nothing special, as someone else said, darkish muddy brown. The aroma is almost like a wheat beer but much more intense, with deep caramel notes. The wheatiness comes out in the taste, with lots of caramel, molasses, and some spice, alongside some heat. The caramel is restrained here in contrast to other sickly sweet bocks I've had. Lighter in body than you might expect from the AbV but not bad. Overall a complex and tasty beer."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.21,"my first eisbock! certainly seems to be one of the rarer styles to be fair. was really struck by how sweet and fruity the nose was, taste wise this beer is a complex blend of sweet dark fruit, dark bready malt and peculiar spice flavours, with some strange oaky and earthy flavours thrown in there, hint of dark chocolate and coffee, some hefe-style estery flavours there as well, medium to full bodied, medium to high carbonation, strength is well hidden but there’s a decent bit of alcohol warming, a real nice supper though, quite a nice beer, glad to finally try it"
Aventinus Eisbock,4.14,"Almost opaque reddish brown, deep, dark, and murky, with one finger of light brown head that dissipates in minutes - not a surprise considering the ABV. Huge aroma on the nose, dominated by ethanol and dark fruit. The taste is the same, with a hint of caramel and roasted malt, but dominated by ethanol and dark fruits. Very smooth, and finishes on the sweet side. Powerful stuff, well worth a try."
Aventinus Eisbock,4.32,"330ml bottle into a goblet. Bottled 9/17/20, so over a year old. Nice.

Looks very good indeed. Deep dark reddish brown body. Decent off white head eventually shrinks to a ring, but at first is thick and foamy leaving a thin sheet of lacing.

Smooth and boozy aroma. A little apple, and a little more dark fruit. Some almond pokes through once in a while.

On tasting, delightfully full and so smooth. Alcohol presence is obviously high, but there is not a trace of harshness, and the burn is mellow. There is some apple there, a little sweetness, even a light bitter touch well into the finish. Dark skin fruit, both fresh and dried.

Mouth close to full and a little foamy. Finish a progression of sweet, warmth, and alcohol.

Overall, a lot of complexity, and very well crafted. As the nights get colder, this would be stellar in front of a roaring fire with a good fruit & cheese plate. My usual bottle shop has a number of Aventinus variants on the shelf, will definitely be looking into those."

It’s really not often that you run by an Eisbock out in the wild; I’ve only reviewed one to date. This one is currently the second highest rated of the style, only behind the legendary Raspberry Eisbock that I’ve been searching for for quite some time. Let’s crack this one open and see what it’s all about

Pours an opaque medium brown with 2 fingers of light beige head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing, a bit of particular floating around in here

The alcohol makes itself very known in the aroma on this one, but it really compliments the gummy fruit character. I’m picking up on aromas of dried plum, dates, brown sugar, molasses, light fusel alcohol, brown bread, apple skin, light toffee, and a touch of hazelnut

This is pretty similar in taste and the quality of it never really dips. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting chewy raisin, toffee, lightly tart pear, brown sugar, brown bread, plum, sweet caramel, and overripe banana. The swallow brings notes of brown bread, overripe banana, cinnamon, bready malt, pear skin, milk chocolate, and light clove

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and thick beer. Finishes off dry with an alcoholic tinge, pretty much the only factor that keeps it from being chuggable

This beer is a damn powerhouse. It should not be this smooth and this flavorful at the same time. If I could get this flavor condensed into a lighter beer I would drink it every day"
Oude Kriek,4.34,"Blend n` 71 season 17/18

Appearance: Clear red color with no head but a few bubbles that quickly disappeared.

Smell: Moderate barnyard and some tart apple and cherries aromas.

Taste: Tart cherry notes feature upfront in the flavor profile, followed by tart citrus notes, and some faint grassy/hay notes. While the cherries are noticeable there is no sweetness observed unlike many fruited wild ales. The beer finish is dry.

Mouth-feel: Fairly light-bodied with a low level of carbonation, appropriate for the style.

Overall: A good fruit Lambic. The flavor profile incorporates the cherries nicely and comes off very smooth."
Oude Kriek,4.43,"Bought at Bottle Craft in San Diego, CA. $18.99 for 12.7 oz bottle. I remember when I first started drinking craft beer, I remember thinking anything over $1 an oz is outrageous. Now that still seems pricy, but not nearly as outrageous. Bottled 6/26/18 consumed 07/04/22. Brought in part to celebrate purchasing my first place and for the holiday. I let it warm to probably ~50F before opening.

A&S: I can see from the inside of the bottle that there is going to be a ton of sediment at the bottom. It will be interesting to see how this changes the different aspects of the beer once poured. Not very lively when opened. Sometimes you get an explosive ""POP"" when uncorking, this was a mild ""plunk"". Without the sediment, the beer is translucent almost opaque crimson red. Over time this color shifts more towards marron. The head is basically nonexistent, although interesting. Only when poured is there head, but the bubble is large and transparent, very unusual looking. A few lazy bubbles of carbonation make their way to the surface. The aroma is surprisingly alcohol forward for being 6.6% ABV

T&M: Initially without much of the sediment, the flavor is super tart. Primarily consisting of under-ripped strawberries and cherries upfront. The flavor stays, but the tartness decreases over time. Semi-dry. The mouthfeel is light and more carbonated than I expected. The taste doesn't linger too long and the beer is not heavy on the tonuge.

Overall: Pricewise this beer is I think worth it for special situations. I really enjoyed it, even with the price consisted. It was a phenomenal example of the lambic - fruit style. Close to being on par with Fou' Foune."
Oude Kriek,3.53,"375ml bottle poured into tulip.

Pours a hazy cherry red with a ring of pink bubbles around the edges of the glass that leaves scattered blobs of foam as it recedes.

Smells of sour cherries, fresh soil, barnyard funk, raspberry jam on bread and boozy oak staves.

Tastes of cherry vinegar, cold cherry pie, more breakfast table raspberry jam, woody funk, moist earth, and oaken barrel staves.

Feels light and sharp. Medium bodied with fizzy carbonation. Finishes sour.

Verdict: Recommended. This is a seriously sour beer. It's pretty tasty but make sure you brush well after drinking this fucker or all of your teeth will fall out."
Oude Kriek,4.17,"A five lambic blend with a total maturation process of 30 months. Rose colored somewhat hazy pour with a pink here-and-gone head. It's Drie Fonteinen, so expect subtle nuances--tartness offset by just the right amount of sweet, a robust cherry flavor balanced by undertones of earth and funk. You can taste the history--it's beer art."
Oude Kriek,4.46,"Pours a deep burgundy-red with a heavy fog to the translucency. Head is a half finger of pink fizz that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is a big slap of cherries, followed by earthy stone, mossy oak, and barn yard funk. It hits hard and quick, bringing with it a little tart funkiness. Cherries are ripe and forward, with a little sweetness that helps smooth out some of the underlying tartness.

Flavor profile is cherries with a huge, funky undertones. A lot happens very quickly - first earthy, stone, and grassy hops flood the senses, before breaking away to reveal ripe black cherries. Underneath is a funky tone, that contrasts the surface level cherry sweetness well, creating a beautiful balance. There is enough tartness to lock the jaw momentarily, bordering on full-on sour, but this trait dissipates as the beer warms. Highs and lows are digital when served cold - that is to say -sharp and contrasting, but as the beer warms, note transitions are mellowed out, smooth like an analog signal.

Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a near-still effervescence. There is a touch of silty grit to the texture, but it's otherwise smooth. Thickness is medium.

Overall, an incredible depth, while still remaining cherry forward. Despite the use of cherries, this is not an overtly sweet beer, carrying heavy tart lambic undertones in both nose and taste.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 375mL bottle. Season 18|19. Bottling date: 03JUL19, consumed 17MAR22, in toast to the memory of Armand. Blend no.86. ABV of 7.2%."
Oude Kriek,4.03,"Pours a beautiful ruby red with excellent clarity. Almost no head to speak of, but a good looking beer nonetheless. Aroma is heavy on the cherries (which makes sense). There's a sweetness to it that is mostly pleasant, but there's just enough cough syrup to the aroma for me to knock it down a notch or two.

Taste thankfully follows the good elements of the nose, but not the cough syrup part. While it's cherry-forward, the fruit notes are complemented very well by some lightly tart, earthy funk that really balances this out. Light in the mouth, clean drinking and somewhat low carbonation.

Overall, quite tasty. Rest in peace Armand Debelder."
Oude Kriek,4.39,"Pours a ruby red with small purplish head that falls quick not any real lace.

Aroma is tart cherries mellowed by sweeter raspberries, good barnyard notes funky and earthy mixed together. Some oak dryness and vinous notes but defiantly more unfermented fruit goodness then wine like fruit notes.

Taste is nice tart cherries right away, then hints of sweeter fruit notes think being sweeter brings you away form the cherry to raspberry or even strawberry like goodness. Finish is the barnyard some light spice and herbal mingled with dry wood notes , hints of the dry red vinous light vinegar hints mingled in. Smooth and complex each sip brings out something a little different almost but probably not in reality.

Mouthfeel is lighter body carbonation is fairly smooth the flavors and vinegar might make it seem lighter also.

Overall a nice little treat."
Oude Kriek,4.39,"Had this wonderful beer with Christmas dinner.

Poured from a bottle into a small tulip glass. Beautiful purplish ruby red color with brief head and no lacing. Very pleasant smell and taste of tart cherries and sweet strawberries. Raspberries and dry white wine. Bit of funk but a nice clean, crisp feel and taste. Enjoyed it even after dinner. The funk and fruit flavors played off each other as the beer sat in the glass. Helped make Christmas merry!"
Oude Kriek,4.43,"12.7 oz bottle dated July 3rd, 2019.

Pours a dark ruby color with a small, effervescent off-white head. The head dissipates almost instantly with no lacing to speak of; Typical for this style of beer. Love the color.

Strong aromas of cherries and raspberry jam, as well as red wine vinegar, wheat, barnyard funk, and earthy, musty oak barrels.

The flavor is a bit difficult to describe. There's just so much going on. There's the expected cherry and raspberry notes. There's also lime zest, honey wheat, green apples, red wine vinegar, pale malts and clove with plenty of earthy oak and damp, grassy hayfunk. Don't think that's a word but it's there.

The feel seems right for the style. Medium-light bodied with lively, effervescent carbonation. Crisp and dry. Very easy to drink.

Overall, this is a great beer. I'm not anywhere near an expert of this style, but it hits all the right notes and complexities that should be expected, and I definitely enjoyed it."

Oude Kriek,4.18,2½yo (2018) bottle...
Oude Kriek,4.32,"Ruby/mahogany body, medium opacity, forming a list rose head with low retention, fizzing to nothing rapidly.
Subtle fruitiness with lightly earthy must and oak, sour cherry of course, notes of raspberry.
How to describe this, it's a tricky one - long aged sour cherry, to the point of almost completely losing it's fruitiness, along with musty, earthy notes, like a red wine; the tartness has mellowed, nicely balanced, and almost a pithy citrus note to it is in the long finish; medium-light carbonation, fine - it relies on prominent but not bracing acidity to perk up the palate (like aged red wine vinegar); medium body, slightly sticky feel.

This grows on you as it lingers on the palate, organic, earthy, balanced, complex. Absolutely worth a try.

2017 bottling, drinking in 2021."
Oude Kriek,3.91,"12.7 oz bottle from 01/23/2019. Pours hazy red with foamy off-white head and lively carbonation. Nose is of vinegar, what malt and red fruit. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is very sour, wheat malt, funky yeast, cherries and hint of wood. Finish is long and very sour. Nice sour."
Oude Kriek,4.42,"Note: 17|18 Vintage

A: Pours a clear but almost opaque dark purplish garnet red in color with light to moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate ruby red + amber colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense creamy fizzy foamy pale pink head that slowly reduces to a large patch of medium thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of tart sour cherries over the top of light to moderate aromas of slightly sweet pale + wheat malts. There are light to moderate aromas of slightly funky earthy horse blanket along with moderate aromas of oak barrels. Hints of red wine vinegar as well.

T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of slightly sweet pale + wheat malts. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of slightly funky earthy horse blanket along with moderate flavors of oak barrels and a hint of red wine vinegar. Finally there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of tart sour cherries which linger through the finish.

M: Light bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp initially with a hint of dryness in the finish. Slightly heavier than moderate amounts of acidic prickliness.

O: Drinks pretty easily considering the complexity of flavors and aromas and the alcohol is well hidden. There is not too much acidity or puckering from the sour/tartness in the beer. Very enjoyable flavors and aromas, especially if you enjoy your fruit Lambics on the sour vs. sweet side. Definitely worth grabbing again and again when you come across (luckily it has been showing up in the area a little more often recently."
Oude Kriek,4.67,"Pour is a beautiful ruby red, appears somewhat opaque while it rests in the glass but is clearly translucent when held to light. 1plus fingers width of pink head dissipates at a moderate rate. Aroma is very tart huge sour notes, nice balancing dark fruits which are of course cherry prominent. The cherry spectrum of aromas is pretty impressive including both tart cherry and sweet cherry pie notes. A bit of oak and big burnt plastic like funk round it round. Taste is wonderful. Massive puckering tartness up front, with plastic and subtle barnyard notes in the middle, and a huge lingering oaky vanilla on the finish. Big fruit notes are present, cherry of course, but also other dark fruits including a watermelon character which I don’t think I’ve ever picked up in a beer but that I really like. There are some floral notes as well. Mouthfeel is vibrant, with a big carbonation and drying finish. This is far too drinkable and was gone way too fast. Overall this is really a wonderful beer. Doesn’t quite reach the complexity of Cantillon Kriek but then again that’s one of my favorite beers ever so really hard to top in my book. Great lambic."
Oude Kriek,4.24,"Shared 750 ml bottle, from Gulating Ølutsalg, Stavanger.

Okay. Fuck. The more I drink this the more I can barely finish the 9oz pour. Sugar cinnamon water. Cloying and WAY fucking 2 dimensional and cloying."

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.27,"Maybe I waited to long to open my 2020 bottle. Mostly chocolate, mild cinnamon, slight coffee which aren't bad. Zero vanilla or pepper. Not bad overall but I expected more from BA's #3 rated beer. Won't go out of my way to acquire another bottle."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.84,"Look - black, thick, copper head dissipates quickly
Smell- Smooth licorice, molasses
Taste - BA imperial stout at its best. The right balance of vanilla bean, cinnamon, whiskey, with the dark smooth licorice and molasses stout. The chilis are not overpowering at all, adding just a hint of flavor without overpowering heat.
Feel - smooth, thick rich"
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.47,Exceptional beer. Like a christmas pudding with a hint of chilli and bourbon.
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.31,"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time now (was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K).

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.

This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.9,"#90, outstanding!"
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.98,"Lucky enough to try this one at Xul Beer Company's first bottle share on Nov. 10, 2021.
Poured into an event glass.
Look- A deep black with a nice tan/brown head covering the top.
Smell- Nice chocolate and caramel mix with a hint of cinnamon. The barrel was present but not as strong as I expected.
Taste- Mostly followed the smell except the bourbon added a nice little kick to each sip. The molasses taste seemed more toward the middle of the pour.
Mouthfeel- Smooth with no carbonation. Not as thick and had nice lacing.
Overall- A first class stout with a great finish."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.55,"Appearance - The poured a thick black color with a dark tan head. The body could block out the sun.

Smell - The nose radiated chocolate with the spice of a cinnamon cookie.

Taste - Initially, the beer was like boozy chocolate. The cinnamon brought to mind spicy cinnamon cookies with ancho heat. Notes of raisin juice and dark fruits follow. It was a bit warming toward the back with a lingering spice.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a huge smooth body with little carbonation.

Overall - The beer may not have been exactly as I expected, but it was quite nice."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.34,"Pours very dark black with a thin tan head on top, Smells of Cinnamon Toast Crunch soaked in Bourbon which I think is pretty nice. The taste of the beer has the cinnamon and the touch of spice in there along with the vanilla and chocolate. The feel is nice and silky, doesn't burn the throat or mouth from the adjuncts which is perfect. Overall it's an outstanding beer and was fortunate to try it finally."
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,4.64,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.

Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

Draft. 8oz pour."

Pliny The Elder,5,"Simply put, this is the best beer on the planet if not the galaxy."
Pliny The Elder,4.92,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. Head retention is good.

Smell: It has strong grapefruit and citrus aromas with some floral elements. There are very low stone fruit elements with a touch of grainy sweetness.

Taste: It has strong grapefruit and citrus flavors with some floral elements. It is very fruity with some light berry notes.

Feel: It is smooth and incredibly hoppy and bitter without any sharp bitter notes.

Overall, this is a wonderfully easy drinking beer with plenty of flavors and aromas."
Pliny The Elder,5,"I can't pin anything down! I love this beer though. So many different flavor notes and aromas!

You could chug it, but why would you do that when you can enjoy the flavors?"
Pliny The Elder,4.14,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin sticky head with medium bubbles. Hard for me to get a sense of an aroma from this brew.

Tastes of bitter grapefruit, hops and orange zest.

Leaves sticky, layered lacing. Very hoppy going into the finish.

Overall great beer, not too heavy on anything, decent bitterness but not too overwhelming. I can definitely taste the hype."
Pliny The Elder,4.56,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing.

Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present.


Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

Overall: This is a unique brew to say the least. Layer after layer, the aroma and flavor complexity played a game of hockey with my senses."
Pliny The Elder,4.38,"In this day and age, there are plenty of solid IPA options."
Pliny The Elder,4.43,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.

S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.

T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.

F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.

O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that."
Pliny The Elder,5,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!"
Pliny The Elder,4.5,"Pliny is synonymous with California beer. Whether it be the Elder or the Younger, the name is a brand within itself. We found the Elder hanging around Lake Tahoe and gave him a go. The crisp, punchy, and herbaceous ale fills the glass with a heady aroma. It is an honest beer and sometimes that is all you need."
Pliny The Elder,4.74,"Had on tap. Looks slightly hazed gold color with 2 finger white head of soft foam. Head fell to a cap after a few minutes. Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot."
Pliny The Elder,3.19,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Cheers. TBB."
Pliny The Elder,4.55,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, nice carbonation, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit, slight rind.

Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then a balancing shot of grapefruit bitterness. Stays balanced between sweet and bitter before the bitterness wins out in the finish.

Overall: Bottled 7/18, tasted 8/13. Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip."
Pliny The Elder,4.4,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.

Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.

This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor."

A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.

S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.

T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.

M- medium full body. Crisp. Hoppy bite.

Pliny The Elder,4.35,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.

Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed."
Pliny The Elder,4.82,"Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.
The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.
Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.
Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.

This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal."
Pliny The Elder,4.4,"The look is clear straw to golden with a nice off-white head. Lots of nice lacing.
Aroma is piney and malty with a little dank to it. Taste is lightly fruity, piney, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. The mouthfeel is very nice with good carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall a delicious west coast IPA."
Pliny The Elder,4.28,"Man, I have been trying to get a hold of this for awhile now. Finally got to try some this week. I wanted so badly to love it! Man is this stuff overrated. Unbelievable. It is a delicious beer, don't get me wrong. But as they haven't changed the recipe (I don't think) this stuff IMHO is not worth seeking out if you've had all of the good stuff. You will be underwhelmed. It is a piney, resinous, hoppy west-coast IPA. I found it to be a glorified Sierra Nevada Torpedo."
Pliny The Elder,5,Probably the best IPA in the world!!! Crisp clean floral hi carbonation everything you can ask for thank you Russian River
Pliny The Elder,4.72,"Absolute stunner. I will never understand other reviewers that claim this beer is in the past. Would you dare poop poo on a Tree House New England style IPA for being stuck in the past? For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!

I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.

There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River. Bay Area beer heads are blessed with those two and Cellarmaker, BareBottle, Revision, and Field Works, to go along with the San Diego breweries that make their way up there."
Pliny The Elder,5,"A-exactly what a west coast IPA should look like
S-Exactly what a west coast IPA should smell like
T-balance bitter piney grapefruit. Exactly what a WCIPA should taste like
M-astringent clean and finishes dry
O-The standard for West coast IPA's"
Pliny The Elder,4.6,The quintessential westie.
Pliny The Elder,4,"In this modern era of IPAs; this doesn't hold up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, it's a great IPA. I can see how a decade ago it was mind blowing. Today its very common place. Breweries like Revision and Alvarado are routinely cranking out IPAs that are much tastier. I'd def drink this all the time if it was more reasonably priced."
Pliny The Elder,4.6,"Russian River Pliny the Elder Imperial IPA, 8% ABV. Pours clear golden with 4+ finger off-white head that left huge foamy lacing. Nose is fruity and malty with light pine. Taste is fruity honey, lightly piney, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. Real nice mouthfeel with good carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall world-class. Should have bought more."
Pliny The Elder,4.3,"Took nearly 20 years to finally get ahold of a bottle, and this one is reasonably fresh, bottled 4/25/22. So, almost exactly 6 weeks from bottling.
Nice fresh aroma with a nice mix of scents with fruit and freshness and herbs and sweetness. More golden than many with a slight haze. Nice dense white head that settles some with some lacing.
Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well.
Body is only a little bigger than moderate but there is nice smoothness and richness that makes the feels soft and full. Not really sticky though.
This is good. And certainly worth the time it took to finally get one. I like the ""cleanliness"" of this. Not sure how else to describe it."
Pliny The Elder,4.68,"Poured from a bottle (bought in early Feb 2022) into a pint glass.

A: Clear, bright, straw yellow body. Frothy white head that sticks to the glass and leaves complex lacing.

S: Probably the best part. Very bright. A perfect blend of pine, mellow citrus, tropical fruit, and honey. It’s actually perfect.

T: The Simcoe hops really shine through here. A tad bit sweet and bitter but extremely well balanced. Does not leave a bitter or a cloying aftertaste. Fresh and sunny like morning dew on a pine tree.

M: Crisp and smooth. Leaves a clean mouthfeel.

Overall: One of my favorites beers I’ve had, certainly the best IPA. The reputation is deserved, well done to Russian River."
Pliny The Elder,4.64,"At Healdsburg CA, near the source, everyone serves Pliny (at weddings, Bardiva, SFO Uncorked, Mill Valley) etc, and it's tempting to stick to this perfect legend where it's so fresh.
a) Acres of lace over a perfect clear golden body.
s) Straw, sun baked grass, herb, hemp, over toffee malt,
t) carmelized core overtopped with marmalade rinds, blossoms, grass.
f) That extra kick in the final swallow is interesting.
o) So glad to enjoy a week of Pliny on vacation."
Pliny The Elder,4.65,Was lucky enough to be at Monk's in Philadelphia when they threw this on. Pours clear gold. Smells piney resin and a little sweet tropical. Taste matched but piney flavors were more toned down and a tropical tone comes out. Balanced. Amazingly smooth to be this up front with the hops. Very drinkable and all around fantastic beer.
Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.53,"3/10/2019 - Apple to nose with hint of coconut. Silky MF, smooth on palate. Well balanced with the vanilla"
Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.33,"A peanut sized chunk of something floating at the surface in the neck of the bottle was visible before even popping the cap. Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.

Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.

Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.

Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down."
Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.75,Batch 1
Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,4.27,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is s mild coconut and vanilla with little coffee accent. Taste is also a nice coconut and vanilla with little coffee. Also bb size particle floating in the first pour.
Sinebrychoff Porter,3.83,"Part of a gift. Drank from the undated bottle. Dark bakers chocolate smell, good mouth feel. Taste is a bit dry some chocolate and coffee? in the rear. Overall a good beer that just seems to be missing something. Is it old? Should I try the other bottle in a glass? Overall I enjoyed this but would not buy this beer unless I saw it on tap just to try that version.

I decided to pull the gold foil sticker off the bottom of the bottle. Surprise, best by 13 November 2020. FUCK YOU Shangys. There are other reasons I won’t buy beer from your shop and this is just another. How many other OLD beers are you putting stickers over dates. The sticker looked like it belonged till I really looked at it."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.43,"An excellent porter. Nice roasted malt, earthy wet skree (best way for me to describe the earthiness), dark bitter coffee, a bit dry with a medium mouthfeel. The way it should be."
Sinebrychoff Porter,3.75,"Not sure about this one. There is a good maltiness to it, with medium carbonation but significant bitterness followed by a smoke/burned taste. It is not a bad taste, just not sure this all works together, feels like it does not blend together, kinda of clashes I think. Maybe I just didn't have a lot of porter lately."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.64,"One of the finest porters I think I've ever tasted, but that could have been just my mindset at the time. In any case, it's very good. Pours near black with a short (1/2"") head that dissipates to a trace. The aroma is wonderful, I got loads of malts with notes of caramel, and a whiff of maybe smoked barley? The taste follows the aroma and it too is wonderful. In addition to the caramel I sense licorice and that smoke essence. The feel is more than I expected, just that good. This is definitely one I would be happy to have in the cellar on a regular basis. I sipped it slowly so as to savor the experience, so good."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.41,"Pours dark brown, almost no head. Chocolate aroma and burnt caramel taste with a slightly hoppy burnt toast aftertast. A very satisfying porter."
Sinebrychoff Porter,3.95,"Pours a lovely dark brown almost black color. Completely opaque and rather ""thick"" in appearance. Pillowy 3-4 finger mocha colored head dissipates slowly leaving a thin layer of bubbly foam on top of the beer. Lots of stick lacing is left behind on the glass.

Aroma has notes of roasted malts, some dark fruits, licorice, and dry cocoa. There is a slight smoky aroma more reminiscent of smoked bbq (as someone described it) more that it is just straight up smoked malts like in a rauchbier. Finally you do get some of that lager yeast coming through on the nose.

Taste follows the nose, you get some roasted malts, cocoa, dark fruit and licorice, with a smoky finish. Very earthy herbal hops provide some bittering on the back end. Light smokiness comes through as the beer warms up with a definite smoked bbq like quality.

Feel is light to medium bodied with a certain dry chalkiness to it. Moderate carbonation prickles the tongue. that dryness to the beer carries into the finish.

Overall this is a really nice baltic porter."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.39,"330ml bottle. Impossible to decipher best before, as the stamp overlaps the text.

Black with a red tint at the edges. Dense tawny head of decent height, leaving medium lace.

Nose is enticing. Fudge mixed with licorice in the centre. Roasted, even some pleasantly burned aromas, hot chocolate, just a hint of red berries.

Long aftertaste of bitterness mixing hops and dark chocolate. Tart roasted bite at the front on the other hand. And in the middle both blend harmoniously.

Still a uniquely smooth example within the style. Hard to break into parts as the elements blend so well."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.34,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Pitch black; no ruby around the edges.

Small dark khaki head which quickly dissipates. Almost no lacing.

Nose is of smoked barbecue, with a rich sweetness. Pork ribs slathered in BBQ sauce comes to mind. Subtle black licorice as well.

Thin mouthfeel; dangerously drinkable for such a dark porter.

Slight metallic flavor on first sip; gives way to malted chocolate flavor. As the beer progresses, the metallic taste (which all Baltic Porters have to me) goes away and reveals a roasted character. By far the best BP I've ever had; complex & enigmatic. Would definitely buy again (and have)."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.21,"33cL undated bottle poured into a Sinebrychoff 20cL becher glass at fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours dense black with mocha brown head. The head recedes to fine layer and ring leaving the glass well laced. The aroma is roasty, somewhat ashy with a hint of black licorice. The taste is semisweet roasted malt with minor fruity undertones. There is a thread of underlying mild tartness throughout along with ashy roasted bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel is full bodied with less than medium carbonation and a roast driven dry finish. Overall, very good. No way for me to know the age of this bottle, but it looks like the case might have rode along on the truck for years before being unloaded. All that aside, this is a very complex beer for 7.2% with no wood or spirit aging and no additives. Everyone should try it once."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.32,"From the stubby 33 cl bottle with no date that I can see. Sampled on April 1, 2018.

The pour is as black as night with lacing-leaving, froth beige head.

Big sweet aroma of chocolate, cocoa, char, roasted caramel, and a little to no hop profile. It smells like an inviting Porter.

The body is creamy, smooth, and easily min the medium to full range.

Same vibrant sweet roasted maltiness in the flavor with chocolate again and a low to no earthy hop profile. A very enjoyable Porter."
Sinebrychoff Porter,3.98,"Bottle vintage 1996.

Pours oily black with barely a trace of head. Zero retention or lacing. Aromatics are chock full of chocolate syrup, Kahlua, and chocolate liqueur. The body is thick and syrupy with an oily, slick mouthfeel. Rich chocolate on the palate with hints of coffee and roast. Mildly sweet. Finishes with lingering oily chocolate.

Pretty tasty for a 20+ year old beer."
Sinebrychoff Porter,3.93,"Classic baltic through and through. The taste and body are the prototypical flavors and well done. Licorice, malt, dark chocolate, mushroom, roasted coffee and caramel all present. The smell has a little macro finish to it, but otherwise also spot on. Pours a lighter black than normal, but still obviously a porter."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.45,"Poured from 33 cl bottle into a glass drinking horn. A gentle pour yielded an incredible amount of spongy-looking tan foam atop a dark coffee-colored body. Very complex aroma and flavor profiles, with dark bread, dried fruit, a little dark toffee and burnt coffee, and a bit of oaky sourness. Silky mouthfeel, a slightly astringent finish with a bit of tongue-coating sweetness. That Synebrychoff can coax so much flavor and complexity out of the most basic of ingredients is truly a tribute to this brewer's craft. Well done!"
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.3,"From notes taken 04/14/17:

Opaque dark brown or black. See some tannish fine fleks clinging to side of glass near the bottom. Evidently very viscous. A rich golden brown head, thick, fine, dense, foamy, well-retaining. Dark chocolate cake, light smoke, toffee, plum on nose. So luxurious, can’t wait, my first true Baltic Porter! Palate is plum-laden! Just dark fruit throughout, very natural, very distinctive, not too ripe, not too conditioned or aged or boozy. Suggestions of pipe smoke, the tartness and bittersweetness of dark chocolate, licorice, and molasses. Light smoky aftertaste. I can definitely see how this is a porter on steroids, might as well be a stout, and is the ancestor of the Russian Imperial Stout. A little booze flavor and heat, but hard to detect under the dark fruitiness. A little less sharp sweetness but more well-rounded than an Oatmeal Stout. Full bodied, syrupy, semi-astringent with low and quickly dissipating carbonation, just enough to make it interesting."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4,"An old school, old world porter. Been way too long since I've had one of these.

Smells sharp, fruity, and chocolatey, basically like some chocolate covered raisins. Rich and intense.

Tastes good, but a tad uneven, with a thin back end weighing things down. Fruity barley up front, fading quickly into dark chocolate and mild hops, ending rough and sweet, with a bitterdry aftertaste."
Sinebrychoff Porter,4.04,"Poured from a undated 330 cl bottle into the test glass.
A - Midnight, new moon dark. An mocha cap of loose knit spheres rests comfortably on top.
S - Dark roast malts, a bit of espresso, bakers chocolate, raisin, plum and lite smoke.
T - As complex as the nose, some dark fruits, a bit of cigar wrap, dark brown sugar.
M - Thin in body, a strong start that kind of peters out, the linger is sweet, and the palate waits but not much else occurs.
O - I like the offering, solidly constructed, nice aromatics, the body is more delicate that I expected."
Juice Machine,3.95,"Shared 473 ml can at Bryne tasting. Cloudy yellow colour, white head. Aroma and flavour of tropical fruits, citrus and pine. Decent bitterness."
Juice Machine,4.72,"Look...A milky orange and pretty dark. White frothy head
Smell...A murky orange with a mango hop peaches and the usual house yeast. Exceptional
Taste...a remarkable dank followed a hoppy citrus peach. A complex blend of bitter ,juice, and sweet with some hop burn. So full and flavorful. This is only the second one I have had but I have a feeling I could get used to this...HAHA
Feel...The usual but still full juicy pulpy. A full culmination of juice and dankity. a round full carbonation with plenty of lacing.
Overall...An excellent beer that I would be glad to have anytime. The intense dry hopping just makes this beer so dank an good. I have had many of their beers and Damn...This beer is very very good and recommend to everyone!!!!"
Juice Machine,4.7,"Look - thick milky odd slitly bornish yellow with a nice white head and lacing though
Smell - super tropical citrus hoppy
Taste - slight night but still super tropical

Overall - just incredible. The look is odd but the smell and taste are incredible. Wish it was slightly more creamy"
Juice Machine,4.42,"Juice Machine

8.2% New England style IPA by Treehouse

Poured into a tulip glass today from a pint can dated 7-12.

The body pours a dark pineapple yellow with a fluffy head. Very good lacing throughout the tasting.

Magnificent aroma. Pineapple, Orange, passion fruit, lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience. This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most. Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout.

The taste begins with a slight bitterness that quickly dissipated into a light dankness. Easy finish as the light bitterness reappears. Super easy drinking.

Mouthfeel is good, soft but not oat soft."
Juice Machine,4.69,"a: super hazy matte burnt orange color with some very light brown notes. 2 finger off-white frothy head

s: you get a punch in the face of tropical notes. loads of melon, pineapple, mango, and tangerine. peach, papaya, and apricot. sweet grapefruit and cantaloupe. some crackery malts as well

t: sweet melons, guava, strawberry kiwi, mango, and pineapple. honeydew, cantaloupe, and clementines. orange juice and a little bit of mango sorbet

m: chewy, fluffy medium mouthfeel with low carbonation

o: this ones doesn't lie. one of the juiciest NEDIPA i've ever had. it's sweet - but not from malts, it all comes from the tropical fruits and melon. seriously awesome beer"
Juice Machine,4.53,Surprisingly a touch bitter and a touch thin for Tree House DIPA
Juice Machine,4.45,"Appearance - The beer poured a shade of orange that seemed to have reddish hues. A bubbly white head topped the glass.

Smell - The nose was clean and distinct like orange soda.

Taste - As is often the case with Tree House, there was a strong orange presence. The profile was also quite green and dank like weed. Notes of melon and guava followed. There were notes of pepper/spice toward the back.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a huge body, yet still had carbonation.

Overall - This was definitely among my favorite Tree House offerings."
Juice Machine,4.44,"Tree House Brewing Co. ""Juice Machine""
16 fl. oz. can coded ""BE KIND 04/21/22 06:58:17"" and sampled on 05/20/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.
Review #7,995"
Juice Machine,4.28,"16 oz can poured into a wine glass. Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a billowy off-white head. Great retention and lacing - simply beautiful. Aroma and flavor feature sweet juicy tropical fruit, citrus zest, melon, creamy wheat, and hints of herbal/spicy/dank hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated, but not as pillowy as Green/Alter Ego/certain other single NEIPAs from TH. Just a hint of booziness. It's really good, but doesn't (for me) attain the highest level of NEIPA greatness."
Juice Machine,4.44,"4/25/22 Canned 3/22. Wow! Hazy, fruity, juicy, grassy, soft& complex. Just delicious. How do I get more of this stuff?"
Juice Machine,4.74,"On tap at Tree House, pours a hazy orange. Smell is a hoppy fruit salad. Taste follows. Incredible beer, shows why these guys are the masters of the style."
Juice Machine,4.4,"This is very nice but not perfect. Pours bright yellow, the nose is very tropical and well done. The body is thick with decent flavor but some bitter aspects and not as full as other TH beers."
Juice Machine,4.37,"Two weeks old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a dark orangish yellow. Hazy and full with a foamy head leaving a thick lacing.

Smell: Sweet tropical notes of ripe mango and pineapple. Hoppy and a bit spicy.

Taste: Mango and pineapple paired with sweet orange and tangerine. Sweet, zesty and bitter. Sharp body followed by a dry finish.

Feel: Full and juicy. A bit sticky. Intense hop burn which flattens a bit as the beer warms.

Overall: Very fruity DIPA with a beautiful look and a full body. Taste-wise it's leaning more on the sweet and tropical side, which, for me, doesn't work as well with its sharp zestiness."
Juice Machine,4.31,"Consumed 1/27/22

Orange with some tangerine and yellow tones, beyond turbid and almost murky, pours with a medium sized head and fades to a few wisps, leaves some nice lacing
Aggressive without being punishing in any way, citrus, orange and tangerine juice, hints of ruby red grapefruit, lime, loads of leafy hops, herbal notes, green and woodsy aromas, resinous hops without being sticky in any way, some spicy hops, tropical flavors, mango, melon, passion fruit, as well as peach, alcohol is fairly noticeable, some sweetness and lingering overripe fruit
Medium body, smooth and slick, carbonation on the low side

Juice Machine was a pseudo-whale for me for a while. For some reason I just could not get the timing right with my trips to Tree House and releases of this beer. Unfortunately, in the last half a decade or so since this debuted, Tree House has only become better at making beer. So it's not exactly mind-blowing compared to some newer offerings. If I have any real criticism, is that there is too much going on here. But I can see how some would really dig the laundry list of fruit flavors."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,3.85,"CO2 version is an annoying combination of pine, resin and caramel malt.

Cask version is creamy, warm, and mild.

Neither yanked my crank."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.21,"This is, no doubt, an old-fashioned IPA, strong on the malt/hoppiness side. This is much better than their Dortmunder beer, I thought. I bought a growler of each. Definitely a better than average IPA but not sure it is worth the extra trouble and cost."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.37,"L: Copper-auburn color with 1 finger of soapy foam that retains well, some lacing
S: pine, grapefruit, some biscuity/carmel malt aromas
T: resinous with a chewy malt backbone. Grapefruit, Candied oranges, cherry.
F: medium body, somewhat velvety, good carbonation
O: Crushed a 32 oz crowler of this easily and probably could have had more. Def my go-to West/Midwest IPA in the twin cities."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,3.93,"Cask pour at MTHB. Cloudy, medium amber with cap of thick creamy head. Aroma is light hops with some fruity overtones. Taste adds a layer of hops to the bready malt base, subtle. Cask brings a nice creaminess to the brew, but hard to believe this is a Top 50. Not impressed."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.29,"Cask at Town Hall Brewery, Minneapolis, MN

A: The beer is crystal clear amber yellow in color and lacks visible carbonation. It kind of looked like a beer on nitro when the waiter brought it to the table with the yellowish and amber colors settling down and mixing together. It poured with a finger high white head that this excellent properties and consistently left a quarter finger high head covering the surface.
S: Light to moderate aromas of citrusy hops are present in the nose along with notes of floral hops.
T: The taste follows the smell and has flavors of citrusy hops - orange and grapefruit stand out in particular - along with notes of floral hops and hints of herbs. There is a light amount of bitterness.
M: It feels very smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: I;'m really glad that I had this beer from a cask as it was a pleasure to drink, especially with the smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

Serving type: cask"
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,3.92,"Had on tap. Copper brown with a finger of white foam. Smell stars the hops in a bitter and herbal way, with supporting caramel malt. Taste was pretty average, with the hops truly starring, but wasn't super memorable beyond the hops. Somewhat bready in feel with the hop textures interceding. Good ipa, but nothing outstanding"
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.35,"On tap at the brewery, pours a very clear copper. Lots of lacing. Older school American IPA but that’s not a criticism. Hops and malts in perfect balance, nice bitter finish. Glad to finally enjoy one of these."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.34,Cask ale. Solid copper color. Big giant head tho but I dug the color. Nose is floral with some of the wood. Feel is silky. Thanks to the cask. Taste is good from the front end to the back going thru the rainbow of bitterness but well balanced with the malt.
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.45,"Growler from the source.

This one pours a completely clear dark reddish amber, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like crusty and bready biscuity malt, resinous piney hops, orange peel, and grapefruit peel.

This is super old school- I can tell this was an absolute banger back in 2006 or so. It's still really great. The malt character is fascinating here- bready, crusty, and just the tiniest bit sweet. There's a great reasinous and very bitter backbone, with slight grapefruit and orange sweetness. It's not tropical or hazy or jooooosy, but it's still great.

This is medium bodied and incredibly drinkable- I was able to take down a 32 oz growler in about half an hour. It's really crisp.

I've been looking to try this beer forever, and I finally just pulled the trigger and traded for a few growlers. It's an exceptional example of how American IPAs used to be."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,3.67,At the source. Tastes like 2009.
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.79,"An absolutely lovely IPA in the style of Size 7 or Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama has inspired many imitators, but few can compare with the balance, delightful aroma and subtle bitter taste of the original."
Masala Mama India Pale Ale,4.25,"Long time want - thank you Chris P!

4-day old Growler into a tulip - crystal clear honey hue, nice 2-finger head with pretty lacing - biscuit malt, piney hops on the nose - resinous pine, long lasting bitterness, great carb.

An IPA from a different time, a nostalgic classic the predates the hop escalation. Great malt, bitterness, hop balance. Tremendous- wish I had access to this around here."

T: Boozy figs, slight vanilla bean, hint of cacao, and a splash of dark rum

O: Nice Black Tuesday variant - the rum is a bit restrained on this batch, perhaps, but embodies the mammoth flavors that are signature to Black Tuesday. Bold, boozy, and makes a statement"
Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,2.77,Big barrel and a decent nose. Wood forward for sure but thin and boozy like a not so thicc barely wine. This is not something I need to seek out again though. Definitely overrated in my opinion and undeserving of a top250 list like this.
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.43,"Poured at 57°. Apple juice copper amber color; excellent clarity; tight white head; ok cap retention leaves small island of micro dots; thin ring; spots of lace on agitation. Apple juice nose. Taste follows, minimal sweetness with just a wee bit of sourness. Medium minus carbonation, light crisp body. Outstanding fruited ale; like drinking adult apple juice."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.39,"Pours a dark coppery color with a fluffy tan head that dissipates very quickly. It smells like sweet apples with hints of ""funk"" and a slight sourness to it. The taste is like fresh apple juice with little malt presence and just enough hoppy bitterness to keep it from being sweet. It's less sweet than a cider but it's not dry like a wine. Overall a very very good fruit beer."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.29,"12oz bottle, no date (but I was told this was the 2021 bottling by the friend who picked it up in WI for me). Served in a Libby globe porter stemmed glass.

Appearance: Clear amber color - initial white head died back quite quickly to leave no head or lacing at all.

Smell: Pleasant amount of apples with a bit of honey underneath it.

Taste: Definite apple flavor, with a bit of bready malt backbone, and then some tart/mildly sour apple at the finish.

Mouthfeel: Nicely thick, good carbonation, crisp and dry finish.

Overall / Drinkability: A very well done fruit-based beer. This would be perfect in the fall, but is quite pleasant and tasty/refreshing as well at the end of a summer evening."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.07,"Bottle reads 'D041'; consumed on 3/31/21

Pours a nearly crystal-clear orange-copper body capped with a finger of fluffy, slight off-white foam; sub-par head retention fades to a paper-thin island of cap, an expansive, bubbly collar, and minimal substantial lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma bursts forth with a casually defined green apple Jolly Rancher tone and mineral character reminiscent of Flintstones vitamins; baked apple crisp phases into the the background as bready malts become more pronounced into the back end and a green apple freshness washes over the close.

Taste opens with soft, flaky malts and a minerality, setting the tone for warm apple juice into a pillowy apple crisp sensation and hint of caramel over the mid-palate; the slightest green apple tart imparts a brightness to the back end of the profile before heartier notes of baked red apples finish.

Mouthfeel presents a body slightly fuller than medium and stoked with a prickly puff of carbonation; waxy textures tease a vague stickiness, which soon steadily fades to a firming density over the mid-palate and a barely perceptible tartness tingles to a peak before a spritzy grit lingers through the finish.

Natural and ripe, this brew effectively distinguishes itself from the cider fusion-types of ale with integrative yeast and involved malt profile, leaving a tactful, fresh presentation of a singular expression at multiple points of nuance."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.24,"12oz bottle. Etched identification marking on bottle is '020231134773B'.
Clear, amber colored body. Massive surge of rising bubbles keep feeding the off white small bubble head. Leaves behind scattered strands of lacing on drinking side.
Aroma is subdued, with malt and apples.
Taste is very expressive with the apple flavor, sweet and crisp. Has a malt backbone.
Thicker than medium mouth feel, almost like creamy apple butter. Excellent carbonation.
It is difficult not to drink this down in one swig. Unknown ABV% but there is no alcohol detected. Just the essential fall essence of crisp apple sitting on top of the brown ale base."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.25,"A: Poured into a tulip glass to a deep gold that is almost brown topped by a dense finger of cream colored head which fades slowly to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells like straight apple juice in the best possible way along with a hint of caramel
T: Taste is crisp and sweet apples with a little caramel. Slight bitter apple skin as well. Swallow is more sweet apple notes with some lingering caramel.
M: This beer is fairly light in body but it is not watery. Carbonation is fairly effervescent but it stays just below prickly while the beer has a semidry finish
O: Overall this is a delicious beer that is probably flirting with cider territory from the flavor department. Definitely good and worth a try. Not the most complexity in the world but definitely an enjoyable drink."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.03,"Barely sparkling copper exhibiting complete clarity with a mild white foam head settling to a soft fuzzy collar leaving an arm of lace or two.

Smell is a mild mix of corn, toasted wheat and grass with a popping, bright, juicy and crisp apple that even has a bit of a honey note to it.

Taste is tangy, almost tart but mostly sweet juicy red apple with a bready, wheaty finish and some Corn Flakes.

Apple Ale has a crisp but soft froth, medium body and semi-wet finish."
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4,Like a cider/beer mosa!
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.11,"Pours Amber. Bubbly, short, Whitehead that Fades fast.

Smells apple juice, light tart apple and lemon hints.

Taste caramel malt, sweet and tart apple, cider, light earthiness. Finish is semi-sweet with an apple linger. Medium body and lightly fizzy medium carbonation"
Thumbprint Apple Ale,4.14,"Let's start off by clarifying that the Thumbprint Apple Ale from New Glarus is no Angry Orchard. No. From the bottle the smell is fresh apple juice. A swig… Surprise, delight, a slight bend of the knee. How apropos, because other apple ales bow to this one. Beautiful foamy head that dissipates after a few moments. What makes this apple ale stand apart is the flavor from the brown ale base. This is no cloyingly sweet sparkling apple cider; oh no. This is fall in a glass, and as you sip, you will feel the sensation of fall leaves swirling around you. You will tighten an imaginary scarf around your neck. Your eyes will glow the same shade as this beer: liquid amber, like the purest honey. ABV is undetectable – it goes down sweet and smooth alright. You will marvel at how you are drinking gently bubbling liquid honey. Don't be afraid – take a bite of the apple. New Glarus Thumbprint Apple Ale is here for you."
No Rules,4.25,"2021 on draft.

Pours a pitch black. Swirling gives way to thick oily alcohol legs, almost like what you would get swirling a dram of bourbon. Not much head, as expected for 15% but a pencil lead thin ring the color of hot chocolate sticks around for the entirety.

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla

Taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes, however subtle. This doesn’t drink like 15%. Very easy drinking, oily, smooth, and full. Excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. Glad to have finally tried it. Cheers."

This is a 2019 Vietnamese barrel aged version.
Quite, quite dark brown, with a thin beige head. No light transmission here. Sweet bourbon and molasses, with some toasted coconut and toffee, in the smell.

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass.

Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine.

Feb 2020 Review
2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass.

Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.

June 2018 Update
Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines.

Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait!
Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.

2017 vintage (orange ball).
Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation.

Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless.

Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms.

Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms.

Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.

Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!"
No Rules,4.42,"2016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.

Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers."
No Rules,4.6,"Perrin No Rules 2018 Imperial BBA Porter, 15% ABV. Pours black with a ring of bubbles. Nose is coconut, chocolate, and brown sugar. Taste is quite sweet brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, bourbon, and coconut, with no bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, overall world-class."

IPA,4.33,"2022-05-08
12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. Dated 03/22/22. Received from @ovaltine in shenanigans associated with NBS BIF #14.

Pours clear coppery amber with a big head and a little bit of visible carbonation. Smell is classic west coast, grapefruit rind and cut vegetation, maybe a little honeysuckle thrown in there for good measure.

Taste is very similar, though with more of an emphasis on that honeysuckle and a bit of a bite in the resinous bitterness. Very bright, very clean. Reminds me of fresh hops a LOT.

Mouthfeel is light and clean. This is a really good beer."
IPA,4.69,"A beautiful golden with hints of orange, crystal clear; beautiful opaque white head with denser islands that linger; great and abundant splotchy lacing.

The smell this beer is to die for; it’s just so fresh smelling and pungent in the most glorious way. There’s an underlying subtle grainy malt; a huge huge waft of evergreen and tangerine like citrus note as well.

Taste doesn’t disappoint that beautiful nose; just super sappy refreshing pine, the underlying citrus is very rind like and the same grainy malt hiding in the background.

This beer is very easy to drink, great soft and creamy carbonation, huge bitter and clean dry finish. The bitterness is beautiful as it hits every where, back of tongue, roof of mouth; just all over.

Great American IPA; I could drink this beer forever."
IPA,4.25,"This beer pours a beautiful golden color with suspended hop haze in the body, underneath a creamy oatmeal colored head that laces the glass nicely. The nose is rife with resiny pine, grapefruit, floral notes, and a bit of caramalt.

The caramalt is more substantial on the taste, and really balances the grapefruit and floral hop flavors, and especially all that resiny pine, which lends a nice bitterness to this flavorful, textured WCIPA.

The mouthfeel is very dry and medium, on point for the style. This would be a terrific “fridge IPA” if it was readily available to me."
IPA,4,"Pours a clear copper with A finger of white suds. Good lacing and islands of foam throughout. Nose is sweet and tart citrus, bitter throughout and finishing dank and piney. Feel is full and chewy with plenty of body. Really good beer. Cheers."
IPA,4.62,"Great IPA from an excellent local brewery. I reside in Columbus and choose to buy local or Ohio craft. With the IBU at 50, and the ABV at 6.3%, this is an excellent balanced IPA. Great tropical and grapefruit flavor. Tasty brew for any occasion!"
IPA,3.64,"This is one is suuuuuper basic to me, all the generic ipa flavors are there and it feels okay its just idk there's so many of these out there to choose from so idk how much I'd choose to buy packs of this. Great one to try but I think ill just stick with Bodhi"
IPA,3.61,"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has an orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pine, a bit of citrus. Taste is the same as the aroma, dank, moderate to significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, but I was expecting more."
IPA,3.99,"Drinking this at The family reunion.
Poured from a can into a pint glass.
Looks orange, yellow with a nice white foamy head that dropped quickly to a very thin ring.
Smells lightly bready, citrusy, grapefruit, orange, sweet.

Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a very nice west coast citrusy IPA that I might order again."

O: solid west coast style IPA"
IPA,3.77,"Bottom of can is stamped 4/13/21. I have no idea what that means.

Body is a nice shade of pale orange with some particulates floating about. Not terribly active carbonation, but the bubbles that do develop are quite large. Not sure what that means, but it looks neat. Fluffy white head leaves rather substantial lacing. Nice looking beer. Lots of pine and citrus on the nose. Grapefruit and oranges in particular. They're not beating me over the head or anything, but it's nice. Taste follows the nose, but is well-balanced with malty sweetness. Medium bitterness level, but it lingers like a motherfucker. It's like I just ate raw grapefruit. There's also a bit of an earthen note on the back of the palette as well. Medium-bodied with a silky soft smoothness that makes this an easier sipper than it should be. Very competently made beer overall, but that lingering bitter burn does hamper things a bit."
IPA,4.74,"12 oz can, born on 8/8/20, poured into a pint glass at 43 degrees F:
L - straw colored with a white head that lingered
S - bitter and piney
T - nice and dank, hoppy bitterness
F - medium mouthfeel with low carbonation on the finish
O - a great beer, probably the beer I drink more than any other. When I think of an IPA, it is this beer that comes to mind"
IPA,4.29,"L: Frothy clear dark amber.

S: Immediately pungent. Quite the bouquet. ""Hopped up craft beer, bro!"" Any chance of discerning the malt is lost. Why can't Wix'n'Stix make a candle like this?

T: Distinctly west-coast style IPA. Tastes good. Buttery malt and oily hops.

F: A little piney but it's a welcome feel for the overall character. You want a nice bitter drink and the pine gives it the staying power it needs.

O: Brilliant. If you're at a party and you put this in the fridge, nobody else will touch it. It has alot of flavor. Not entirely over the top. There are lighter IPAs available for those who wish it."
Smoked Porter,3.99,"Pours a dark brown with some red highlights, a thin tan head and no lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, a bit of smoke and some nuttiness. Taste follows the nose with additional notes of dark fruits and a nice hop presence. Expected far more smokiness, seems more like a porter. Medium bodied, light side of medium carbonation, smooth mouth feel."
Smoked Porter,4.13,"From a bottle brewed 12/27/15. Dark brown color with a thin layer of brown head. Roasted malt and vanilla smell. Feels a little thin. Roasted malt and smoke with some hop bitterness on the finish. Great flavor, wish the feel was a little bit heavier."
Smoked Porter,3.92,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing. Aroma is dark roast, dark fruit, chocolate, a little cherry and smoke. Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable."
Smoked Porter,4,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma. There's a light kiss of smoke but it makes you work for it. Unfortunately, although a good beer, when reaching for a smoky fix I go for O'Fallon's smoked porter, Yazoo Sue, or Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock."
Smoked Porter,4,"It pours a deep dark black yielding a spectacular one inch white foamy head leaving some nice lumpy valleys in the head. The head dies within a minute. The smell is a roasty, dry coffee sort of thing going on with a nice amount of hops allocated inside of some light cocoa. The taste is dry, roasty, bitter and sweet at different times throughout the beer. Some burnt malts seem to come through a bit as the beer warms. The palate is medium to heavy coating my mouth and tongue nicely like it should on a cold winter’s night. Sharpness is slightly there. Overall, I liked it for the most part and would come back to it."
Smoked Porter,4.01,"22-oz bottle into porter/stout glass

M - smooth medium body, low to moderate carbonation

O - complex and very enjoyable; paired excellently with my wife's chocolate mousse cake!"

Wee Heavy,3.68,"750 ml bottle, kindly shared by abemorsten. ABV is 10%. Very dark ruby colour, nearly black. Low beige head.

Wee Heavy,4.19,"Look - dark brown muddy color with a slight film rim
Smell - sweet caramel booze with some fig
Taste - a lot like the scent
Feel - a lot of body light carbonarion
Overall - great tasty beer. A lot like a barley wine"
Wee Heavy,3.67,"Had this when I was visiting the old brewery. Pours a dark mahogany and chestnut brown almost leaning into black territory. We're talking ~ looks similar to an imperial porter at this point. Tan colored head, 3/5"". Good retention. Solid looking beer. The aroma is a mixture of earthy malt, toffee bitterness, booziness and mild smoked caramel sweetness.

Taste is chewy but not thick. More of that brown and smoked malt (in a minor way, not rauchbier levels) aspect. Mingles some dark fruit like influence. Mouth feel then gives more nuanced complexity in that you start getting more of a nuttiness angle to compliment all the other stuff. Moderate heat, which means at a double digit abv, it hides the alcohol decently. Thinner body than the appearance and taste would seem to indicate normally. Carbonation on point. This seems like a good candidate for an evening around a fire, especially campfires."
Wee Heavy,4.35,"Probably my favorite Wee Heavy. Perfectly balanced, nice and boozy, just the right amount of sweetness and not overly malty. This is one of my go-to's when visiting Alesmith and it remains a menu standard because of its consistently world-class brewing. Good stuff."
Wee Heavy,4.21,"Bottle. Poured out a semi-opaque, black color with brown highlights and a khaki-colored head of foam. Smelled peaty and smokey with roasted malt. Big, strong roasted malt flavors with smoke and peat."
Wee Heavy,4.21,"An excellent Wee Heavy. Poured from a 750 ml bottle with silver foil around the neck into a tulip glass. Huge dark cream colored head with great head retention and bands of lacing on the glass. The brown color is dense but there are reddish highlights coming through. A great looking beer!!!! Aroma is sweet, malty with traditional toffee and some oak as well. Taste is more of the same. A delicious rich malty, sweet beer with toffee, oak and warming alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is rich and mostly smooth with a slight alcohol ""burn"" and a little oak bitterness. This is a bit expensive, but a great beer."
Wee Heavy,4.5,"Bomber bottled on 10/15/15 poured into a tulip.

A - pours a dark brown opaque color with an off white head.

S - lots of sweet caramel roasted malts, toffee and oak.

T - more caramel sweetness, toffee and nuttiness. Also get some smokiness on the back end.

M - silky smooth and creamy. Finishes clean and smooth with some noticeable alcohol warming.

O - this was a great sipper and definitely one of the top Scottish ales I've had."
Wee Heavy,4.25,"Into a thistle, the appearance has a dark brown close to brown colored body with a two finger white foamy head that dies at a nice pace; lacing is extremely light and tries to cling but spider webs and slides; the aroma has a nice assortment of caramels, chocolates, the normal light peat that usually comes in a Scotch ale, slightly boozy; the taste is sweet through the previously mentioned flavors; nice boozy somewhat chocolatey aftertaste; the finish is really interesting actually, I get the sense that it wants to be dry, hmmm....but comes across slightly smooth and sweet, maybe even somewhat sticky; on the palate, this one sits about a medium in body; sessionable - not really, more of a sipper; carbonation comes across slightly smooth; overall wow, I really like this Scotch Ale."
Wee Heavy,4.38,"A 22oz bomber with a bottled on date of 10.2015. So 1.5 years old

L - Dark brown, 1/2 a finger of head and no lacing

S - Raisons, brown sugar, dates, and definitely ...booze!

T - Sweet up front and throughout, sweet potato, raisons and dates, brown sugar, and licorice. The brew changes as it warms up. Excellent

F - Thin body and well carbonated

O - A very complex beer. So much goodness going on, and every sip you discover something new. Fantastic job Alesmith"
Narwhal,4.23,"For the price, this is a fantastic Imperial stout! Very smooth and thick ( without being syrupy) , I get strong elements of dark coffee and cocoa powder. There is a bitterness on the finish, but the texture is so smooth that there is very little alcohol bite or resinous linger. It really is worthy of grabbing anytime this one is released, BA version are especially good too!"
Narwhal,3.43,"12 oz can, 2020 vers.

Excellent for the money"
Narwhal,4.47,"Ebony with a 1/4"" tan head, which slowly fades. Moderate lacing.

Aroma of coffee, chocolate, roast malt.

Taste is rich chocolate, coffee, roast malt. Astringent.

Full body, light carbonation. Dry, astringent finish.

Excellent cocoa flavor. This is a very good Stout."
Narwhal,4.4,"Appearance: Pours a jet black color with a thick body and large and rich somewhat dark tan head. SRM of 24. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of chocolate, espresso bean roast, and earthy molasses. Vanilla notes are there. Earthy and black malt notes follow before a chocolate finish. (4.25)

Flavor: Intense flavors of rich chocolate, coffee, toasted black malt, and some vanilla and rich chocolate on the end mixed with some mild earthy toasted malt and smooth espresso roast notes. (4.50)

Feel: A large body. Rich and smooth without being too cloying or thick. Appropriately and surprisingly clean and dry for 10.2%. (4.25)

Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 1/16/22: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More chocolate and espresso bean roast. Less black malt, earthy notes, and root beer.

Overall: This one surpassed my expectations. What a beer. Intense chocolate, espresso roast, but goes down smooth and clean enough to make you long for another sip. Definitely a sipper and hides the alcohol extremely well at 10.2% (Final Rating: 4.40)"
Narwhal,4.66,"Pours black with a medium persistent rich tan head. Smell is roasted malt, some coffee notes, maybe even a little dark fruit. Taste has a big sweet backbone but it's overwhelmed by the bitter roasted malt. Great malt profile that's hard to place. Dark chocolate and coffee notes, but that's a bit of a cop out to describe what's a more complicated malt taste. Spicy warming boozy finish. The most noteworthy thing here is how surprisingly balanced and drinkable this is. Heavy for sure, but it goes down dangerously easy. Nicely carbonated. Really great imperial stout and a great beer for a cold January evening."
Narwhal,4.5,A great Imperial Stout for the money. Delicious.
Narwhal,4.11,"12oz bottle poured into Teku glass. Picked up from liquor store for $2.79. 8/13/21 printed on the top of the back label, so this is about 4 months old.

Appearance - Opaque black body. Medium brown 2-finger head with good retention, lacing and stick. 4.75

Smell - Dark roasted character primarily. Then some caramel and chocolate and vanilla, and alcohol. It really doesn't hide the alcohol very well. 4.25

Taste - Dark roasted coffee. I just now read the description on the back label and it literally says word for word ""dark roasted coffee"". So yeah, it sure lives up to that. Baker's cocoa noticeable too, as it notes. It's not bad by any means. But this style has very stiff competition, and I rate within style. 4

Mouthfeel - A little harsh. Boozy. Full bodied. But a relatively clean finish for the style, which isn't saying too much. 4

Overall - Pretty solid beer. Pretty middle of the road for the style. No major flaws. Easy recommendation, especially for the price. Good value. 4"
Narwhal,4.37,"I'm not (yet) much of a stout guy, having cut my teeth first of IPAs and, more recently, sours. But beer is an adventure, so here we are!

Sierra Nevada straddles the line between craft and macro pretty well. I've been disappointed by their limited edition IPAs, which lean heavily into the bitter without much balance. But I was pleasantly surprised by the Narwhal. A very sippable stout with a deeply roasted flavor that never crosses the line into burnt. Strong but not overpowering. Dark as sin with a light head."
Narwhal,4.55,"look: 98% black, deep, thin foam,

smell: chocolaty! a lot!

taste: chocolate, coffee, heavy bread, a good mix

feel: smooth and abv hidden well, body is pretty thick, altho it's 10%, good balance also

overall: this is gold. at least 2021 version, I like this one better than the barrel aged one. cheers!"
Narwhal,4.28,"12 ounce bottle packaged on 8/21/2020 poured into a DFH tulip. Thick tan head over an inky brown body. Smell was of malts, chocolate, molasses and char. Taste followed the nose. Mouthfeel was very creamy whether from cellaring for a year or maybe just natural. I can see why others hold this in such high regard. An excellent Russian Imperial Stout which will be present in my cellar going forward."
Narwhal,4.1,"I can't say much that hasn't been said, so cutting to the chase this is a very good RIS deserving of the rating.

It pours a thick looking oily black, very clear.

The smell is of chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, char, molasses and I think just a hint of licorice.

What I find surprising in the taste is the chocolate, but this is fresh and I look forward to letting this age and seeing how it changes, but right now I am getting a significant chocolate flavor, that seems slightly sweet at first but as the coffee and roasted malt takes over, the sweet sensation fades to a hefty but short-lived combo bite of char, espresso, acridity, and some bitterness. Coffee acridity and char lingers a little, but pleasantly.

Even young, no alcohol beyond a pleasant warmth. I'd call it medium body, somewhat creamy, just enough carbonation to hold it up. Glad I have five more to play with later, anticipating this to be even better with some time."
Narwhal,4,Cheapest quality craft beer drunk that isn’t an ipa. I imagine this would taste amazing aged a few years. Unfortunately it tastes a little bland for the style fresh and the alcohol taste is definitely stronger. Overall great for what it is.
Narwhal,4.44,"12 oz bottle, born on 8/21/20, poured into a snifter at 53 degrees F:
L - dark and oily with a hazelnut head that faded
S - roasted malt, biscuit
T - malt, licorice, molasses, bakers chocolate
F - thick with light carbonation
O - very good stout, nice range of flavors"
Narwhal,4.59,"I popped the top, inhaled a whiff.. WOW! A boozy wake up of bourbon and vanilla/rum notes charged up my nostrils! A pour into a pint glass left a gorgeous 1-1/4 inch foamy head, which held never fully depleted, and left a perfect, relentless trail of lacing. This brew is black as midnight! The taste? This is my kind of beer.. Solid bourbon over coffee and chocolate, subtle vanilla/ rum/ molasses sweetness.. robust decadence. More than a bit of booziness, Sierra Nevada is not for the fainthearted, uninitiated, or nouveau drinker. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy , too sticky.. and the aftertaste is all bourbon. But if you like a good stiff beer, this one's for you!"
Hop Nosh IPA,3.99,"Uinta hop Nosh IPA (bottle)

S: slight flower, citrus rind smell; pretty nice
T: nice citrusy earthy taste with subtle sweet toffee notes
M: medium bodied and smooth
D: nice feel and taste combo; very good beer overall"
Hop Nosh IPA,4.03,"Based on my fairly unkind perception of Hop Nosh's expression back in 2015, I find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now, as that opinion just does not apply anymore, largely in terms of my own palate, preferences and overall experiential evolution.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.

A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

The moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry."
Hop Nosh IPA,4.25,Great go-to west coast ipa
Hop Nosh IPA,4.15,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sixpoint can glass

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.

Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness.

Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Overall, a very good beer that I would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf."
Hop Nosh IPA,3.91,"12 oz can pours a clear copper color with a average off white head of large bubbles, leaves some lacing in my glass. Fresh grapefruit and pine aromas, hoppy citrus and pine flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry."
Hop Nosh IPA,4.09,"Clear amber appearance with a large, off white head and good lacing. Appealing aroma of pine and citrus. Hop flavors are a bit more mellow than anticipated; more floral and herbal. Modest sweetness, but bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish."
Hop Nosh IPA,4,Pours a lovely golden bronze color with an off white head. Smell is malt and citrus hops. Taste has floral and orange / grapefruit hops some pine resin and a sweet malt kiss. This is an IPA that is the way it used to be. Bitter hoppy malty.
Hop Nosh IPA,4.71,"Ok folk's !!! I do not do alot of reviews on this site any more due to my general lack of enthusiasm with the hype of the Hazy IPA craze !!! Tropical this, melon that, no malt just hops and yeast and quite frankly it is extremely boring too say the least. There is no such thing as balance anymore. BORING !!!!

This is an old school IPA that is not geared for the hipster IPA scene. It has plenty of hop aroma and flavor that when paired with the selection of rich malts creates an exceptionally balanced brew. Yes I get it !!! Most younger folks will not appreciate this balance but I actually miss this style of an IPA !!! An IPA is supposed to be balanced !!!! Nowday's brewery's can just throw hops in a hop back with a tinge of pale malts and become an overnight success. Zero balance and flavor nuances.

I give this brew two thumb's up because of the overall balance of malt and hops. This is what and IPA should taste like. I am bored to tears with the current IPA offerings from brewery's. No thought or balance just hops. I have zero respect for the brewmasters / breweries."
Hop Nosh IPA,4.05,"Pours a sunburst orange with a lighter orange/yellow at the top. Slightly murky tint to it. Head is a finger of snowy white foam with modestly good retention. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, orange, mango, resiny and dank hops. Light bready, earthy malts add a bit of balance and 'boniness' to the back-end of the aroma. It's a pleasant contrast to the initial hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine, mango, resiny, herbal and dank hops with bready, earthy, toasty malts. Balance is great, with the hops out front and sticking to the tongue long after the sip. Mouth feel is lightly sticky with a light graininess to it. It has a medium to medium-thick consistency offering up a 'heavier' presence. Overall, hops are great and are contrasted well by malts; however, the focus remains wholly on the hops.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Hop Nosh IPA,3.98,"Appearance: Pours a deep orange, dark peachy color. A white and lacy head. SRM of 13. (3.75)

Aroma: Dank resinous melon, lime, pineapple, and red grape. A touch of vanilla yogurt with berries. (3.75)

Flavor: Lots of lime, red grape and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of lychee and an almost plastic or medicinal quality. Finishes with rich caramel malts, yet a fairly strong bitter finish. A unique flavor, but also reminiscent of some of the first IPAs I've tried. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied, Average carbonation. Lingering bitter pine and pith which is appropriate. Right in line with what an IPA should be. (4.00)

Overall: Definitely a good IPA. Takes the IPA back to it's origins in terms of a hop profile. Reminds me of some of the first IPAs I tried. On par with what a good IPA should be. Nothing extraordinary, but a good rating for being traditional and accurate to it's origins. (Final Rating: 3.98)"
Hop Nosh IPA,3.87,"Can Date: 6/12/19
Palate Contaminants: none

Color is a medium orange. Slightly murky. Moderate amount of fine head that doesn't hang around so long.

Lots of malt on the nose, but the grain evokes a wheat brew. The sweetness also contributes to a marmalade scent. Light bits of vegetation, specifically cilantro and moss. Overall, it could use some more intensity, though.

Bitterness up front right away, and too much of it. The moss is still there, but the sweetness and anything connected to it is buried. The bitterness even disconnects the malt from any sweetness, which actually makes the whole thing not so cohesive. Not that it's not palatable, there are just so many other good IPAs out there.

Good medium weight, and the carbonation is pretty smooth. Alcohol about par for a sevener. Bitterness just continues in the aftertaste."
Hop Nosh IPA,3,"Some of us get a soap odor and flavor that doesn't do it any favors. Its harshly bitter at points without too much nuance overall. It is serviceable, and would go well with a slice or two."

Moinette Blond,3.64,"Bottled on: L19013A (Whatever that means? I'm guessing 2019??)

A - Pours a hazy, somewhat murky medium to dark golden orange color with ultra dense bright white creamy foam resting on top. Carbonation is moderate and steady.

S - Banana, light spice, yeasty, slightly bready.

T - Bready with light spice and citrus. Ends on the sweeter side.

Moinette Blond,3.75,"Cerveza de color ámbar, con un dedo espumoso de retención media. De cuerpo y carbonatación media. Aroma a levadura, banana y caramelo. En boca tiene un poco mas de amargor pero bien matizada con un final dulce."
Moinette Blond,4.18,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)…
L- Dark golden with a hint of amber. Pours with moderate haze; some encrusted sediment left in the bottle. 2Cm pillowy off-white head.
S- Aromatic leathery timber. Ie. Belgian estery yeast notes.
T- The smell follows through directly into the taste. The estery notes are now clear - they often remind me of the smell of sweets called Pear Drops we enjoyed as children. Plenty of bright hops into the finish to balance thing out too.
F- It's a good solid beer. The estery notes are really prominent; it would be a great case study if you wanted to demo such to someone unfamiliar with them.
O- I like it. Mega-esters popping right on your palate. Bright, interesting and balanced flavour. Solid and meaty and yet not even a hint my palate is going to get jaded by this. 60% gone now and the head is still right there holding up at 1Cm+. I reckon this is versatile too. Works great in winter (it's snowing out in London/UK today!), bright enough for a summer's eve. Robust enough to pair with solidly flavoured food incl spicy food.
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! ==> Bottle-conditioned, 8.5%ABV, it was politely discreet about the latter.
330ml bottle £4.15 BB: 10/23 Bought from BelgianBeerCompany, Stoke/UK as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London."
Moinette Blond,3.81,"330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.5%. Hazy golden colour, moderate white head. Strong fruity and spicy aroma of Belgian ale yeast. Spicy and yeasty flavour, medium sweet, with notes of white kandij sugar and stewed fruits. Moderate hops."
Moinette Blond,3.79,"Gold-colored, veiled and with orange reflections. White foam with medium texture, compact and excellent grip. Perfume, bread, pear, citrus, candied sugar, ginger, spices and herbaceous. On the palate a light sweet entry, biscuit and yellow-fleshed fruit, the finish is dry with a bitter aftertaste with spicy and herbaceous notes. Hidden abv. Medium body and high carbonation."
Moinette Blond,4.02,"Delightful. My first strong Belgian pale I think. I usually go for Strong Dark, Dubbels, and Quads. This tastes similar, but a tad lighter with a touch more bitterness. Nicely sweet, and paired well with a roast duck dinner. It was better as it warmed up, I think I had it too cold initially. No hint of the 8.5%."
Moinette Blond,4.23,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Aug 2022 and served at cellar temperature.

Pours a bright, clear golden-yellow hue, producing just over a finger of foamy, sparkling white head. It withers away over the next several minutes, leaving behind a thin cap and wide, frothy collar, with a narrow band of lace also having been deposited. I'm getting orchard fruits and yeastiness on the nose - appleskin, clove and white pepper, with hints of banana, pear and candi sugar sweetness, all layered atop of a bready pale malt backdrop. Not bad at all.

A quality Belgian strong ale; the flavours follow the nose, with grainy, bready pale malts providing support for notes of apple, white grape, apricot and pear. Hints of lemony citrus and bubblegum crop up as well, with yeasty, spicy aspects of clove towards the finish, and just a tad of floral hops & earthiness into the aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with moderate carbonation levels that froth up in the mouth a little, gently tickling the tongue; feels smooth and velvety soft in the mouth. The 8.5% is a tad noticeable, but not in an intrusive way, as it blends into the profile quite effectively. If it weren't for the small serving size, this might be a much more dangerous beer, particularly given the ease with which I tossed it back.

Final Grade: 4.23, an excellent A-. Moinette Blonde is a very solid BSPA that I enjoyed the hell out of. Now, I don't know if I'd put it on the same pedestal as Duvel, but in terms of quality it's at least in the vicinity of that ballpark. The stock around here is beginning to dwindle, but hopefully I'll manage to pick up another bottle or two for short term (less than 2 y) storage in the cellar. Highly recommended to any BA with an appreciation for Belgian pale ales."
Moinette Blond,3.77,"This is a refreshing beer, you taste the belgium style, slight hops, light citrus malt aroma, smooth to the pallet, and a nice aftertaste. This is a great Belgium pale ale and probably one of the better ones I've had. Definitely a summer drink and dangerous for 8.5 ABV."
Moinette Blond,3.95,"The look is lovely Belgian and the nose is equally good funky saison. But the taste is somewhat disappointing. It's a bit fizzy, haltingly dry and just an overall weaker sister of St. Feuillien Grand Cru, to which this seems to inspire but cannot reach. Really, you could do worse if nothing is available in its class. Otherwise....meh."
Moinette Blond,4.1,"Color of light shimmering gold with white cap and lacing.

A clean aroma of ripe fruits such as apricot, pear and peach.

Taste is a combination of the scent fruits along with touches of yeast rolls and a bit of spice. Can't quite nail down the spice as it's very light but cinnamon and clove come to mind. Complex, sophisticated and quite refreshing.

Light to medium texture with balancing carbonation.

In scent, texture and taste this is a good deal milder than I usually get from a Belgian Blond. Not de minimis but certainly no block buster."
Moinette Blond,4.26,"330 ml bottle served very cool into a chalice. LCBO purchase for about $3.35CDN. Best before August 2022.

Appearance - Hazy rich dark golden color, capped with a finger of white head that actually fizzles out much quicker than I thought it would. Sparse lacing clings to the edges of the glass.

Smell - Powdery yeast, bready donuts, some fruit, namely apple, pear and peach. Inviting and warm. A touch perfumey as well.

Taste - Light and bready, some funky yeast, slight bits of candi sugar and more sweet fruits, apple and pears most with a peachy sensation. So good and easy to drink.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, booze is so well hidden and well carbonation, fizzy and expressive without being gassy, 8.5% ABV is wonderfully hidden.

Overall - Yeah, a strong Belgian Pale Ale brewed by Dupont, what where you expecting. Delicious and inviting, it's not quite Duvel, but pretty much the next best thing in the style, really should try to do a comparison between this, La Chouffe, Duvel and Delirium seems like a fairly even 4 way fight for supremacy and what could wrong in that situation?"
Moinette Blond,4.41,"Hazy, unfiltered, gold body, capped by a thick and dense, cream-white head. Rock solid retention is as good as it gets.
Floral yeast spice on the nose, mostly of coriander, along with mild sweet fruit - ripe, cooked apple, banana.
At first sip, thought it was too candy-sweet, but there's a bite to it, a sharpness, of alcohol heat. That heat is paired with deft touch of bitter hops that lends some balance to the finish, which is off-dry. This feel is most distinct, but the flavour is interesting as well, the sugars finding balance on the palate over time to let the complex umami yeast notes shine - indiscernible spice, fattiness, sourdough, stewed apples. Even a sense of cocoa and cinnamon in the finish. That's my attempt to describe it, but I've always found these to be indescribable. There's a light note of clean minerality in the finish - like purest water. Medium body and medium carbonation, very fine.

Belgian beers are my favourite, so call me biased, but this is a delight to drink. An outstanding example of the style."
Moinette Blond,3.3,"De cervezasespeciales. En copa Grimbergen. Viendo Mr. Robot 2z02-03. 9 meses pasada de fecha. No esta mala pero la encuentro mas apagada, aburrida, plana y seca de lo deseable."
Moinette Blond,4.28,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/2/2018. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big lemon, orange, peach, pear, apricot, melon, red apple, white grape, citrus peel/zest, peppercorn, light banana/clove, candi sugar, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, light honey, hay, straw, herbal, wood, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, candi sugar, moderate pale/wheat malts, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, peach, pear, apricot, melon, red apple, white grape, citrus peel/zest, peppercorn, light banana/clove, candi sugar, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, light honey, hay, straw, herbal, wood, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, woody, floral, grassy bitterness; and peppery yeast spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, orange, peach, pear, apricot, melon, red apple, white grape, citrus peel/zest, peppercorn, light banana/clove, candi sugar, wheat, cracker, biscuit dough, light honey, hay, straw, herbal, wood, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, candi sugar, moderate pale/wheat malts, and earthy hop flavors; with an fantastic malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness and carbonation. High carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and creamy/bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 8.5%. Overall this is an incredible Belgian strong pale ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, candi sugar, moderate pale/wheat malts, and earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink for the ABV; with the modestly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly well rounded and vibrant Belgian yeast complexity; with balancing pale/wheat malts, sugars, and earthy hops. Minimal residual sweetness from crisp dryness. Very well attenuated for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazingly spot on style example as expected of the brewery."
Moinette Blond,4.4,"Poured into a Duval glass with a nice thick head of foam. The look, smell, and taste is outstanding. This is a very well made, complex brew that is top notch.
Well done!"
Moinette Blond,4.26,"Gorgeous straw colored beer with think, creamy head. Aroma of honey, hay, grass, citrus, caramel. Taste is sharp and tangy, butterscotch, bread, honey. Mouthfeel is light with tingly carbonation and dry finish. Worthy of its reputation."
Moinette Blond,4.27,"Pours a hazy golden color with a medium top of white creamy head and a lot of yeast sediments swimming around.
The aroma is of spicy yeast,sweet malts,citrus and overripe fruitsand some bready notes. The flavour is fruity sweetness with spicy yeast and some light malt notes in the back. The finish is slightly bitter and dry with nice spicy and herbal notes, and it has a long and comfortable aftertaste. The flavours are amazingly good balanced, and the alcohol content are very well masked. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean, and it has a mediium body with a moderate carbonation.
A great and delicious example of it,s style. A top belgian beer that i would love have again."
Moinette Blond,4.33,"An enormously thick head covers a slighly hazy & lovely golden body. Lots of bubble action from never ending mini gysers. It’s aroma is one of the prettiest I’ve ever experienced, like a caramel flower. Not as sweet as it smells, bananas & caramel apple. Yummy! No alcohol detected. And all those bubbles massage the tongue on the way down. More please."
Burton Baton,4.29,"Pours a copper color. Smells of a light vanilla, probably hops, and oak. The taste was that of a clean and crisp beer. Very tasty and delicious. The 10% ABV is hidden but effective. I like it and will definitely get more when I get the next chance."
Burton Baton,3.94,"It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background.

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.

The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.

Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout."
Burton Baton,4.31,Backlog
Burton Baton,4.57,"Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic."
Burton Baton,3.7,"Had this on draft.
A: pours orange amber body with off-white head with ok retention and lacing
S: sweet, orange grapefruit smelling beer with subtle earthiness
T: sweet, grapefruit taste with a subtle earthy aftertaste; some lemon notes as well
M: medium bodied and pretty smooth
D: nice mouthfeel and tasting combo; solid drinking beer overall; pretty good beer overall"
Burton Baton,5,"Worth the price

Pours golden amber with thick suds.

Smells like like oak barrel. Clean and sweet.

Tastes like a creamy dream. Can't even taste the 10% abv and that's a fact. Most oak barrel aged stuff is a bit cloying but this has perfect balance. After taste of spicy vanilla that leaves you wanting just 1 more sip. Superb.

Extremely excellent brew! Lots of love goes into this force of nature.

Expensive but damn this is worth it. Dogfish Head is still a top tier company and this one proves it like a MF."
Burton Baton,4.39,"Bottled 4/1/17

Copper color. Left the sediment in the bottle. Khaki whit me head.

Everything I was hoping for. Malts and faded hops and oak all around. Caramel, toffee, bready malts, floral and citrus notes, vanilla, oak... this beer has it all. Love the grapefruit citrus. Not bitter or sticky, just smooth and easy drinking for 10%."
Burton Baton,4.14,"Bottled 3/1/19

Pours a mildly hazy copper/orange with 2+ fingers of fluffy off whit head, tons of lacing

A lot of subtlety in the nose, but right off the bat I pickup citrus, specifically orange zest, a light vanilla and caramel malt. Very complex in aroma, I'm guessing the flavor will be the same

Yep, I was right. Complex, but balanced between a biting hop and sweet malt. I pick up the oak notes clearly, it plays off the more bitter hops really well. The vanilla is in your face on the finish, with a mild citrus aftertaste

Gentle carbonation leads to a medium-full bodied brew. Finishes sweet and soft, wouldn't guess 10%

I've been on a good streak lately with a lot of beers that I'm loving and this one is no different! Not sure I could drink a lot of it, but I'll come back to this every now and then"
Burton Baton,4.46,Such a unique and delicious beer. Smells about as good as a beer is able to. So smooth and complex. I hope they never stop making this.
Burton Baton,4.45,"This has been sitting in the fridge since I bought it in August as I waitd for some cold weather. Pours a brigt amber with heavy rotation orange tining. Head is thin but steady. Nose is wood and mint and vanila.

This is velvety in texture right off the bat, and while the flavors are rich and luxurious, they are also, for the style, subtle as hell. The primary flavors are caramel malt doused in oak and vanilla with peppermint, dark fruit, and black pepper in reserve. The texture is thick in the sip but there are very few other signs of high abv. This is an exquisite rarity. I am generally not a huge DFH fan and find them talented but inconsistent and overpriced. This is delicious and unique. Well done."
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.37,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; bottle 09/29/2017.

S: Aromas of grapefruit and peach predominate with toast and pine in the background. Spicy.
T: Lemony zestiness predominates with a light, nicely balanced bitterness.
M: Light to medium bodied with solidly strong carbonation.
O: Really a solid Imperial IPA. A real winner."
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.24,"BOD 3/31/17. Pours a cloudy amber a bit darker than a dirty golden. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Quite outstanding nose of bright citric and tropical hops over a slightly sweet base that is both bready and biscuit. Orange and light tangerine provide the citric element while pineapple and soft mango take center stage. There is a very soft spruce/pine element but you have to look for it.

The body is almost medium and quite smooth with a bit of oiliness to the texture. The carbonation / body balance is borderline outstanding. The middle is nicely effervescent and really opens the flavors up just past the middle. The finish isn't rollicking but does yield a nice prickly effect.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. The rich nose doesn't quite follow through. The citric and tropical elements are there and shine in the middle. Orange and mandarin lead then shift to the sweeter tropicals (soft pineapple, light mango, then big pineapple). Like the nose, the world class balancing sweetness is bready then shifts to cracker biscuit near the end. Bitterness is surprisingly moderate yet ample and the balance is again world class. The bitterness is a combination of zest and spruce. Near the end, alcohol becomes slightly uncovered and fosters the spicy pepper element of spruce. The finish lingers and is mostly a blend of zest and spruce coupled with that nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat."
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.75,I love imperial IPA and Dipa they are my life. I think that this is a master piece it is next to perfection. It caught me off gaurd cause I chose it at random when I did a Mix pick at the grocery store. I poored it and was watching a movie not even paying attention to the beer it was my second IPA of the night. I took a sip an Bam. I knew it was a 90/90 I was expecting a punch to mouth but was smooth as a 40/40. The abv on this is not there at all. Most thicker IPA's make you pay for it with strong boozy tastes. Not this one the alcohol is almost silent as the citrus and hops and an almost roast nut flavor just hugs your tast buds it was a tease that I only grabbed one cause Wow. I can definitely agree with Beer bros this is world class. You can really tell the a lot of hard time and effort was spent creating this amazing beer the best part is that it wasn't like a $20 bomber. But it could definitely earn a seat at the table. Definitely a must try for any pale ale enthusiast! I will definitely seek this one out in the future!
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.41,12 oz. bottle poured into a Spencer chalace glass. Golden haze with 3/4 inch head. Nice citris smell that you would expect from an American Imperial IPA. The 9 ABV is deceiving and this beer drinks easy for an Imperial IPA. I am not a big fan of Doubles or Imperials but I really enjoyed this one. I will have this one again. I love their Hop Commander IPA.
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,3.56,"I got a lot of odd lager yeast on this beer - a bit washed-out & adjuncty. Hops are strong, ""dank"", oily, a bit astringent, a weak diacetyl floating in the background. Not exceptional but not offensive"
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.56,love it.
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4,"Poured a see-thru straw gold body with good head and lace. A slight skunky, dirty, earthy hop aroma. Classic west coast stuff from an east coast brewery (IMO) b/c it's an oily, bitter, earthy, dry beer with crisp and dry finish with just a touch of buttery sweetness to make sure the hop bite is great and not overdone."
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.05,"On tap:
Pours a vibrant gold that somehow lens both slightl orange and slightly yellow. Head isn't strong, but rushes when beckoned by a swirl.

Nose is sweet peach nectar, which really shines after a swirl (and is more subdued without). A not very ripe tropical fruit skin bitterness is sensed on a calm beer, and a sharper ripe spring onion after a swirl. I've never noted a beer be so different in sense and strength swirled and not.

Taste starts clean, allowing a lightly alcohol burning/biting note to hit me. It doesn't come alone, but strikes me more than the peach, pineapple, green pine cone flavor I also get. The latter is nice, the former doesn't work as well for me. A raw herbal bitterness and a clean, Pilsner malt-like maltiness close the beer (another nice aspect).

I liked a good number of aspects of this beer, but I also was not a fan of others. I can see why the ratingbis high for most. If the nose was more obvious or less hide-and-seek, I'd rate it higher individually. So it could inch higher, but my overall is decent n the verge of inching lower, so that may be a wash."
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,4.21,Nice look to this beer. Scent is of citrus with some fleshy tropical fruits and slight pine sweetness. Tropical fruity flavors to start with some pine bitterness to balance out the malty sweetness. Nice depth of flavor and decent carbonation on this beer with alcohol well hidden.
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,2.84,"BOTTLE: 12 fl oz format. Brown glass. Uninteresting label design. Branded black pry-off crown cap. Purchased at a Whole Paycheck in NYC as part of a 4-pack for $10.99.

""Imperial IPA."" 9.0% ABV.

Served cold into stemware.

HEAD: ~3 inches in height. Off-white. Frothy and creamy to style. Retention is rather good for the high ABV - ~10 minutes. Leaves a thick coating of lacing on the glass' sides as it recedes.

BODY: Slightly hazy translucent orange-yellow of average vibrance. Nontransparent. Lacks any visible yeast/lees, but it doesn't seem filtered; definitely not a clean appearance.

Appears well-carbonated. It's a nice looking imperial IPA, but the appearance isn't unique or special.

AROMA: Fresh citrus jumps out of the glass, hitting juicy notes of fresh tangerine and evocative mandarin orange along with lychee, passionfruit, and papaya. Pale malt sweetness keeps any hop bitterness in check, but all the hop flavour is there, and this aroma is more expressive and vivid in terms of its fruity hop notes than any I've encountered this year. Though there's a blip of alcohol warmth, this is a rather inviting lively aroma that promises a balanced beer with loads of hop flavour. I'm eager to try it.

No overt yeasty notes or off-notes. Aromatic intensity is moderate.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Opens soft, welcoming the drinker with early notes of soft lychee, mandarin orange, and faded tropical fruits (papaya, tangerine), hitting the citrusy hop flavour nicely but not to the extent the aroma promised; it's not all that fresh, expressive, or juicy. Sharp zest intensifies as the flavour profile runs through its structure, culminating in a sharp overcarbonated zest-forward finish plagued by a warm alcohol undertone. Not boozy or ""fusel"" as the kids are want to to call it, but definitely warmer than would be ideal.

The result is a beer that evokes a booze-soaked tropical fruit profile akin to overpriced girlie drinks on some island resort, giving it a cheap taste. The shallow depth of flavour doesn't help.

Flavour duration and intensity are average. Not a balanced brew in terms of alcohol presence, but the pale malt backbone is enough to prevent the hop bitterness from really hitting the palate hard. It's not badly built all things considered, but the aroma promised so much more than the taste delivers.

Smooth and wet, but too boozy to be refreshing in spite of its relative softness. Certainly overcarbonated (sharply so in the third act), and a bit thick. Creamy, hinting at orange creamsicle when coupled with the citrusy flavours. A softer, juicier, cleaner mouthfeel would be ideal, as would less overt alcohol.

OVERALL: I've lived in New York six months and as much as I keep trying to get into these Captain Lawrence hoppy ales, I never seem to like them as much as everyone else. I commend the brewery for their sour ales, but this hop profile isn't great, the beer doesn't deliver on the promises of the aroma, and it's way too alcohol-forward for my taste, tanking its drinkability. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but far from world class. Won't dazzle the discerning drinker, and I wouldn't buy another 4 pack, but I'll enjoy polishing off the one I got. Decent at best...do I just keep stumbling across old bottles from this brewery or something?

C (2.84) / AVERAGE"
Palate Shifter Imperial IPA,3.74,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of tropical fruits, pine, resin. Taste is dank, resin, orange peels, pine, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer. I like my hops, but this one may be pushing the envelope just a bit."
Westly,4.36,Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk. Flavor is initially the fresh apricot flavor that's mostly sweet with tartness coming in behind it. The finish though is overwhelmingly sour. Great overall but acidity is strong with this one which detracts a bit from the sweet apricot fruit like notes I enjoy most.
Westly,3.86,"Look - Fantstic yellowish color with a nice white head and lacing
Smell - sour super tartness
Taste - about the same as smell with some wood and citrus
Feel - medium body and lighter carb
Overall - not to bad, horrible smell"
Westly,4.96,"2021 Release - Drank 8/24/21

Pours a bright yellowish orange, with good carbonation. Sour fruit and funk on the nose.

Taste: This one is all about the apricots. Big jammy fruit taste, that balances the sour and oak so well. Its easy to see why this is rated so high, and lives up to the hype. If you like this style, this beer is incredible."
Westly,4.72,Shared bottle at brewery. ‘21 new release.
Westly,4.35,Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Sour apricot aromas. Big sour apricot notes dominate. Super sour but still damn tasty. Good body and mouthfeel.
Westly,4.31,"Bottle @ RateBeer Best 2016. A later pour from the bottle, so a little bit chunky, but fine with me. Intense apricot and just overall juicy fruity quality to both the aroma and flavor. Pleasant lemon and citric acidity here without being over the top. Notes of lime, grape skin, and oak to go along with all the apricot. Really nice."
Westly,5,Incredible
Westly,4.46,"2018 batch poured at cellar temp.

Nose is strong apricot, minimal funk. Taste follows, strong apricot, minimal funk, strong acidity on the end. Feel is effervescent, medium carb. Overall, it is a great apricot beer!

2020 batch
Very similar to 2018, I got more fruit on the nose, less on the taste with a lot less acidity, better rounded and get more of the house culture.

2020 batch rated"
Maximus,4.3,"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and tropical fruit. Body is full and smooth. Herbal hops dominate the palate with caramel malt, tropical fruit and some honey in the background. Finish is long and very dry. Great brew."
Maximus,3.96,"This one delivers like Santa on Christmas - - except that it’s available 365. And colossal is kind of chill, too. Like Caligula before the crazy set in, ya know? Anyway, it’s just a goodie. Nothing grand, but a goodie. Honey, caramel malts… This cat says, “Meow.”"
Maximus,4.8,"Double IPA? This is a smooth Bitter IPA HOps Beer with a smooth finish.....
Smoothest IPA I have ever had? really drinkable....


I've had double IPA's and this concels the ABV very well?!?!
NIce flavored hops, pine first, then goes into sweet malt..like toffee or caramel.......
really drinkable for a double yo.......bought a six pack for only 9.99 in Sante Fe New Mexico Americas Oldest Capital !!!......
Great IPA from Lag.........try it out yo........................"
Maximus,4.23,"This is my go to beer. Get two six packs for 17 bucks at Woodman's in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Just a delight at this price."
Maximus,4.81,"Amber with a 1"" cream colored head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.

Aroma of toffee, raisins, citrus, pine.

Taste is toffee, caramel, orange zest, tangerine, pine, spices, earthy.

Medium body, lively carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.

Outstanding! One of the best IPA's I've had."
Maximus,4,"19.2oz can stamped 060322 poured into a nonic pint glass at fridge temp 9% ABV. The beer pours bright light copper in color with creamy khaki colored head. The head recedes to a thin cap and leaves some light lacing. The aroma is mild with burnt sugar caramel and pine resin. The taste is bittersweet caramel and pine with a hint of citrus. Heavy bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. The abv is well hidden. Overall, very good old school west coast DIPA."
Maximus,4.13,"A solid double IPA. More resinous than citrus with a heat that builds up as you continue drinking. Plentiful pine notes with the resin. There is some citrus, but this is definitely a resin type of DIPA. Dry finish with plenty of bitterness. There's some malt character here but it is easily overshadowed by the hops. It feels a bit on the heavier end of IPAs and does tend to stick around. As I continue to sip on it, notes of pineapple, savory notes, and even candied dried fruit."
Maximus,4.26,"Love the hoppy smell when the bottle is opened. Tastes great and you really don't notice the higher ABV, especially on a warm summer day. Very drinkable anytime but iced cold is the best.

Lagunitas did a great nice job on this one. Definitely recommend this beer to my friends and family."
Maximus,4.3,"Unlimited Release - 6 pack
12 oz. bottle dated 104 2 (4/14/22) - 9.0% ABV / 60 IBU
Brewed and bottled in Chicago, IL
Poured into a Bell's branded nonic pint glass

Look - Pours a dense off-white head that leaves lacing. Crystal clear, golden amber appearance with a small amount of streaming bubbles.
Smell - The scent is very floral. Also picking up a lot of citrus like orange juice, and some berry scents.
Taste - The taste follows the nose with the floral and citrus flavors blending together and creating a pleasant taste. Bitterness is very minimal, and alcohol taste is non-existent.
Feel - Medium bodied mouthfeel and finishes with almost no dryness.
Overall - A dangerously drinkable brew that has great citrus and floral flavors, and you know it."
Maximus,4.02,"Ahhh, that west coast pine, and malt backbone. So nice!"
Maximus,4.13,I got a 6pck of bottles of this beer from my local meijer store. It poured a clear copper with thin white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had bitter citrus and pine hop notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with sweet malt base and bitter citrus and pine presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.
Maximus,3.72,"12oz Lagunitas bottle served in a pint glass. Beer is brilliant golden in color, with great clarity, and a nice fat orange-tinged head. Aroma doesn't have me jumping up and down, but there's big alpha hop flavor, complemented with a very slightly syrupy golden caramelized malt body. An oldschool IIPA that doesn't go overboard on alpha. The result is bitter but still quite drinkable. Super Cluster is obviously way more modern and interesting, but balance never goes out of style."
Maximus,4,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Clear copper in appearance with more than a finger's worth of tan head, good retention and lacing.

Aroma: lemon rind, grapefruit, orange, resin, pine, herbal hops, cooked grains, brown sugar, honey.

Taste: Tasting the grapefruit upfront, some sweet and spicy notes to the side, quite earthy, bitter aftertaste. Bready malts. Essentially follows the nose. Body is medium-light."
Maximus,4.38,"Bottled 1/22/22. A thin, tight white head with a few rocks sits atop a pale amber liquid with excellent clarity; good cap retention; heavy ring; bands of medium sticky lace. Sweet caramel malt; grapefruit, orange and a whiff of pine; some earthy hop aroma as beer warms. Taste is sweet malt base followed by bitter grapefruit peel hops; orange peel middle; very little pine with some earthy hop dullness on backend. Medium light body, moderate minus carbonation; no warmth from 9% abv; no astringency; smooth malty/sticky feel. Overall, the beer verges on sweet vs. bitter; it reminds me of The Waldo’s but less sweet and less phenolic; admittedly, this is my DIPA wheelhouse - West Coast baby!"
Maximus,3.75,Not the malt bomb I was expecting. Overall pretty decent beer but probably a one and done for me for now
Maximus,3.1,"This is the modern day 40z beer. Its cheap, good enough, and will get you buzzed. Its better than Old-E but worse then other WC IPAs."
Maximus,4.17,"Pours a beautifuly clear copper color with a finger high head that is slow to recede leaving strong lacing 'til the end
Smell is earthy and predictably hoppy
Has a well balanced flavor between the hops & malts
Mouth is full bodied with a semi bitter finish
LaGunitas is always a good go to brand and they don't disappoint here
Life is uncertain. Don't sip!"
Maximus,4.16,"Super hoppy, really dank. Damn solid double IPA. Lagunitas has the recipe for awesome IPAs and this one is more of the same."
Maximus,4.25,"I was nervous to try something called a ""colossal"" IPA, but Lagunitas has not let me down yet. Glad I tried it. Pours a lovely amber, I didn't get much of a head but the lacing is there. Smells wonderful, like grapefruit, lemon, malt and a nice vegetal essence. The taste is definitely balanced, in an impressive way with sweet malt as a backbone and sharp citrus notes with bitter hops all dancing in harmony. Slightly quick and clean finish. Each sip makes me want more, but at 9.0% abv this one is dangerous."
Maximus,4.17,"This has a nice semi dark amber color to it, perfectly clear and very effervescent. The head is thick, about two and half fingers and very bubbly and long lasting.
Nice citrus smells, lemon rind and grapefruit rind mixed in with a mild wheat grass and pine aromas and a bit of a pungent smell follows that.
Smooth and very tasty, the grapefruit flavor hits you first, followed by a semi sweet pine and spicy/herbal mix, very earthy. It leaves a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth.
The body feels a bit light for the style, but that being said, the flavor is right on and more than makes up for the feel, overall this is a fun beer to drink."
Maximus,3.68,"Clear orange-colored brew with thick, enduring off-white head. Pungent piney aroma. Medium-heavy-bodied. There's reasonable balance between the malty sweetness & bitterness of hops. Warming, though the 9% ABV isn't apparent in the beer's aroma and taste.

I'm burned out on IPAs at the moment and took this because it was offered as a freebie. If I were in an IPA phase, I'd like it quite a bit. It s drinkable for its weight and well-executed."
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.74,Batch 3
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.5,I expected a little more. But it was still pretty tasty!
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.25,"A: The emergence is dense on lucidity with a materialization that ensues oily margins. Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above

S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length

T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin

M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms

O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,5,I think it's basically perfect. Hands down the best Barleywine I've ever had!
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.75,Amazing
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,4.2,"375 mL bottle. Deep amber. Smells bourbon, dark fruits, oak, brown sugar. Tastes of strong oak, bourbon, brown sugar, and dark fruit. Sweet, but doesn't overwhelm. Lingering oaky back end. Hits hard, but it's pretty darned tasty."
Bière De Mars,3.5,"750 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ""French Style Stock Ale - Ale Aged in Oak Barrels"". ABV is 7%. Hazy amber to brownish colour, large off-white head. Strong aroma of farmhouse. horse blanket, lemons, oak and apple cider vinegar. Medium sour flavour with lemony and oaky notes, fairly distinct and peppery hops in the finish. ""Beware the ides of March!"""
Bière De Mars,4.04,"Pours a cloudy brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, strong bacterial funk, fruit, and yeast. Fits the style of a French Biere de Garde. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong tartness and dryness. Tastes of sweet malt, alcohol, strong bacterial funk, fruit, slight wine, and yeast. Overall, good appearance, blend, aroma, adn body."
Bière De Mars,4.01,"I think Biere De Mars a Flanders Style Sour Ale from Jolly Pumpkin, ABV 7.00%, is quite thirst quenching and good for hot weather, but perhaps not tart enough for the Flanders Style, or maybe it is a French Bière de Garde like it says here?

Look: reddish light brown with a thin off white head.

Aroma: toasted bread, wine, citrus

Taste: It is sweet, toasty, a tad of red wine, grapes, and a hint of lemon, but it is very mildly tart.

Feel: light to medium body"
Bière De Mars,3.42,"A: Pours up a hazy, thick, amber with a creamy, foamy, 1 finger head.
S: Immediate tannic funkiness, common to all Jolly Pumpkin beers, with some passion fruit coming through.
T: Tart, but not overly sour with some lactic tartness coming through, some slight chocolate coming though and some toastiness as well, hints of lemon, the malt is fairly heavy, but the tannins present in the nose don't come through nearly as much. There is definitely some funk here from the oakiness, but like I said, the tannins are kind of downplayed.
M: a bit too full and a tad watery.
O: I know that this is technically a biere de garde, but this is not a biere de garde. If this is a biere de garde, then the term means little to nothing as far as the consumer is concerned, and if it only refers to process, then the term is essentially useless. This beer is fairly good, but I've never had a Jolly Pumpkin beer that blew me away, and this is no exception. It's fine, does it deserve to be one of the most highly rated biere de gardes on BA? No, no it doesn't. That being said, most American Biere de gardes are BDGs by technicality, bearing practically no resemblance to beers like cuvee des jonquilles, or tre montes from st. sylvestre, or l'angelus au froment from brasserie lepers (y'all sleepin on that one, check it out, it's beautiful), so yeah, this beer is fine, it's a good sour beer (though not especially sour, not a complaint, just an observation), but if you never have it, your beer life will not be wasted."
Bière De Mars,4.34,"Decent color, with solid fruit and oak tastes. Not too sour. Very well done beer that has great balance. Drinks easy, with good mouthfeel and aftertaste."
Bière De Mars,4.05,"Had on tap in the Jolly Pumpkin restaurant in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood within the U of C redeveloped Harper Court. This is my 4th different Biere d' garde from JP (unusual to have that many offered by one brewer.) But now that I spent a few minutes on their website, I understand their business model in the Belgian sour/cuisine niche. So, it makes sense to have that lineup from across the border, taking advantage of the French kitchen's most food-friendly biere and, frankly, one as well-suited for a variety of foods as my #1 favorite, the saison.

Biere de Mars has JP's signature tart/sour/Brett; but not, thankfully, as strong as some. I had this on a hot day and it was refreshing and paired very well with the table's frites. I rate JP's de Mars with average Looks, but malty Smells are all there with just enough of tart in the nose. Tastes come in even better because the hops and tart clean the palate very clean for the next frite and its heavily butter-fatted mayo.

I give a high OA rating because I like JP's strategy (particularly its deal with the non-tart North Peak to diversify their beer list and grow their business beyond the narrow tart niche.) But liking JP is not necessarily liking their beers; only 1 (Maracaibo, a sweet brown) of the 8 beers did I give an above average rating. My tolerance for sour/tart remains low no matter how many times I try to change that."
Bière De Mars,4.32,"This year's bottling from 02/08/17, drank at cellar temperature.

Slightly hazy dark auburn in the glass that shines up to a reddish antique copper in the light, with orange amber highlights. It leans more towards amber bière de gardes than blondes. Finger of tight off white bubbles that quickly recedes to a thin layer. Whatever lacing sticks around inevitably gets pulled back into the body with the next sip.
Lots of tart red apples, hibiscus, a little white grape and red raisins, lemon, a little pepper, caramel. A whiff of an oak aged Manhattan with a dark cherry as well as balsamic or sherry vinegar. Bright sourness and fruits with a bed of earthy and malty aromas beneath them fit this style of bière de mars. Miniscule alcohol spice.
Much more focused on the sour aspect in flavor, at least while it's cold. A prick of acid followed with red apple skin and extra tart green apples, lemondrop or Warhead candy. Cherry and strawberry and caramel with subtle cola syrupy flavors and oak. It finishes with some sour and funk and earthy toasted wheat bread, with a light bitterness. Some alcohol in breaths, but overall hidden. Just below cellar (or just above refrigerator) temp. is where it works best for me, it's balanced between sour and malty and a lot of good flavors bubble up. Warmer yet, the oak, caramelly malt, grape, and hint of cornbread soon become musty and the bright fruits and acids get shy.
Medium bodied, effervescent at first then soft in the swallow, and dry.

Enjoyable and interesting, but not amazing. At first it seemed overly sour but the rest of the flavors came out with some warmth and it leaned towards the malts. It feels like it's going downhill though, if I were to age it any further I'd wax it hot off the bottling line and stuff it in a very cool, dark place. That said, not aging well comes with the style and it's still great for the summer."
Bière De Mars,3.68,"This dark brown gusty looking beer was poured into a tulip. The rest of the appearance had a slim half finger-ed white foamy head that dissipated within less than forty seconds. A minimal amount of spider web lacing slid down the glass. The smell was mainly a tart combination of blackberry, cherry, and currant, all pretty pronounced and leading towards a sour fruitiness. The taste was mainly sour and tart with a nice side dose of the cherries to amplify the the sourness. On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body with not so much of a sessionable aspect to it as it comes across pretty sharp across my tongue. Overall, I say this didn't seem too much like a Biere de Garde but a nice sour ale."
Hercules Double IPA,3.94,"pine pine pine bitter bitter bitter bready bready

very old school, not hoppy"
Hercules Double IPA,4,"Citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods/ pine forest. Other more non-description tropical fruits appear as this warms. You’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. I agree. Tasty stuff. Big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff. Like many also note, the hops don’t dominate here."
Hercules Double IPA,3.32,"The can I have isn't expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. If this how this normally is then it's honestly awful to me. Zero hops just malt, like this is so disappointing I'll have to try again to see.


Seeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.


Update, after trying again I more or less confirmed what I thought while also liking this more. Still not for me but for those more into malty IPA'S."
Hercules Double IPA,3.61,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%., 85 IBU. Orange to amber colour, slightly hazy. Moderate but lasting off-white head with an orangey hue. Pleasant aroma of fruity American hops. The flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish, on a malty sweet (too sweet?) background. Very bitter aftertaste. ""Not for the faint of heart"" - but I MIGHT get used to this ... I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a ""double IPA"". A bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book, but still a good beer."
Hercules Double IPA,4.04,"Six pack of cans purchased at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington.
Canned on SEP 24 2019. Poured in to an Erdinger pint glass.

Look- Slightly hazy darker golden amber color, glorious off-white head that slowly recedes, beautiful lacing. Light carbonation streaming as it sits.

Smell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), honey/caramel malts, resinous pine, over-ripe tropical fruits (mango, passionfruit and light pineapple), some stone fruit. Light spicy/herbal notes.

Taste- The honey sweet malts are much more prevalent in the taste than the aroma. The hoppy fruitiness and pine assert themselves in the finish, well balanced.

Feel- Rich, full bodied with faint alcohol tones. Very smooth with a solid semi-dry bitter finish. Moderate carbonation on the tongue.

O- A really nice DIPA. A little pricey but I'll be coming back to this one."
Hercules Double IPA,4.28,"From notes 1/22/12: Pours deep gold/pale amber with 2 fingers of frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head which leaves a heavy, pasty lacing behind as it recedes. Aroma is citrusy orange hops and sweet caramel malts. Taste is huge hoppiness! Oily with orange zest in a malt background of cane syrup and caramel. Big hop bite and bitterness from start into the aftertaste. Taste is complex, almost in an abbey ale sort of way. Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% ABV until the brew reaches room temperature where it blossoms."
Hercules Double IPA,4.29,"Found this at T0tal W!ne in Houston after missing it on the local shelves for several years.
Probably more than a bit overpriced i.e. you can find better brews for less money. But, it's an excellent beer, good taste but not overly hopped and little or no juniper or other cringe-worthy (for some people!) ingredients. Herc is a very worthwhile brew which has been around for quite a while. If you're looking to test drive an IPA, this is a great choice."
Blackout Stout,4.5,"I love this beer period, from the dark rich color to its smooth mouth feel, It's one of my seasonal favorites. I went so far as to buy a sixtel and Put it on tap in my bar. It was then I found the fatal flaw. While me and all my friends were enjoying this if it became apparent that there was a 4 drink maximum, as anything beyond that seem to have everyone ready for a nap. That 9% is a bit heavy for more than light drinking. So while I still love it I'll enjoy it in smaller quantities."
Blackout Stout,4.75,"I loved the grape flavor at the beginning and how finishes into more or a cherry flavor inside the chocolate malt. I loved this beer and will probably get it any time I visit the tap room.


Unfortunately the bottles I've gotten this year absolutely no where near as good"
Blackout Stout,3.99,"On tap at airport for my breakfast. Absolutely tasty stuff, and unable to get any Great Lakes at home in NH. Would love to try again cellared. A tad on the bitter side with more hopping than I normally enjoy in this style, perhaps that mellows well with age."
Blackout Stout,4.52,I quite liked it. I remeber I exchanged a bottle with Jeffrey for a Dark Lord at Alvinne. Would do it again.
Blackout Stout,4.5,"Just had one of these last weekend, aged over 2 years. Very smooth and a very mellow alcohol taste. Love the dark color."
Blackout Stout,4.58,"Jet black, small head. Smell is straight strong coffee, taste a slight bitter chocolate in the coffee. I loved this!"
Blackout Stout,3.96,"First poured into a sniffer than pint glass. This stout presents itself with a rich dark brown color and aged golden head.

Tastes of toasted malt and dark chocolate with a touch of sweetness. Smell gives off hints of black coffee but not too much else.

While I enjoyed the taste. The mouth feel wasent as velvety as I was hoping. But overall, a fine RIS indeed!"
Blackout Stout,4.09,"From a 12oz bottle dated 5/13/20 into a pint glass.

Pours a somewhat thin opaque black with about a half finger of light brown head. Retention and lacing aren't much to speak of.

Smells of coffee and alcohol and a hint of sweetness.

Taste is coffee and dark chocolate. for 9.9% abv, the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Very pleasant tasting.

Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like for the style but the taste more than makes up for it. Generally easy drinking.

Overall, this is a pretty decent RIS. A little thin, but taste is rocking and price point is great. More, please! :)"
Blackout Stout,4.48,"Pours a jet black with normal carbonation. head fades pretty quickly, aroma is of roast, coffee, malt. Taste is much the same, but everything is very balanced. A nice bitterness but no flavor stands out too much."
Blackout Stout,4.12,"Rating from notes. Consumed Summer 2012. ""Rich & velvety"""
Blackout Stout,4.52,"Poured on a cold night from a 12-ounce bottle into a snifter. Deep blackish-brown color, with ruby highlights and a thick tan head. Big aromas and flavors of dark roasted malt, with notes of molasses and dark fruit, a hint of espresso bean, and lots of char and roasty bitterness lingering on the palate. Silky smooth in body, sweet but not overly so. The alcohol is very well hidden. Enjoy-by date on this sample was 5/29/19, but still fabulous eight months later. This is the perfect complement for a wintry night. Prosit!"
Blackout Stout,3.16,"Dark color with some light reddish hue on edges. Smooth smell and taste with a coffeeish presence. Light feel compared with other stouts. Finish was pleasant. Overall, tasted a bit too ""alcoholly"" for my liking, $10.99 + tax for a four pack."
Blackout Stout,4.36,"this is a serious stout. deep black on the pour with a smallish head. aroma is a mix of char and sweetness. flavor is more of the same with a bit of coffee, chocolate, fruit and bitterness. just delicious. the mouthfeel is very smooth and luxorious. the taste of the alcohol is there but overall this is just terrific."
Blackout Stout,4.13,"Pours out lighter than I maybe have ever seen for a stout of this nature. Highlights all the way throughout. I had low hopes because of this, but as I put my nose in and tasted it, it’s actually a pretty solid stout.

Beautiful roast mixing with unsweetened cocoa while remaining clean throughout the entirety. A little on the thin side for what it is, but not too thin by any means."
Blackout Stout,4.24,"Light carbonation with a slick,thick,creamy feel.
Aroma is roasted charred malt,wood,earthy, sweet malt, sweet black licorice
Taste is bitter charred malt on the finish and lingers. Licorice isnt as sweet as aroma suggests but very noticeable. Smokey,earthy,wood
Excellent complex,full flavored. Not usually a fan of licorice but was great here and the other flavors are so strong and bold that the licorice doesnt dominate"
Blackout Stout,4.24,"Procured Trader Joe’s in Cleveland.
Pours black and slightly oily with finger of creamy mocha head.
Aroma of coffee grounds, chocolate, molasses, and hint of booziness.
Taste of dark chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, notes of licorice, and roasty coffee- slightly bittersweet boozy at the finish.
Medium full mouthfeel- smooth, creamy, a bit roasty and warming booziness. Bitterness lingers briefly.
Very nice.

June 19/22 Same batch now 3+ years on it - superb - even better than the fresher bottle."
Blackout Stout,4.92,"My favorite Stout on the planet. Only wish it weren't a seasonal brew! Rich, complex flavor, not too bitter. Full bodied but not too thick. Deep, dark color. Simply the best!"
Stella Artois,2.98,"Poured into a 2/3 pint glass . 4.6% UK brewed version .

Smell : Alcohol and slightly astringent

Looks :Closer to yellow than amber, a fingers width head that bubbled down completely. No lacing.

Taste : A slight sweetness that moves into a slightly too sharp bitterness that lasts long after the mouth full.

Mouth feel : Decent , not too thin or thick. Carbonation is extra fizzy , bordering on pop like.

Overall: To use a sports analogy Stella Artois is even par in golf . Nothing to be upset about , nothing great but nothing awful. You can do a lot better and a lot worse ."
Stella Artois,3.21,"Had on tap at bout time pub & grub Arvada

On arrival the head was a bit disappointing, 1 finger of bone white average bubbles, that dissipated quickly to a vague ring. Body is a golden yellow, with lazy carbonation.

Aroma is light, with some vague and not very present euro bittering hops and a light light pale crackery malt. Very clean however.

Taste is once again pretty light but malts do come through clearly as malts, with just a bit of corniness. A light but clean and floral hop bitterness is present, but once again pretty light. There are some light esters in the mix, but I can't pinpoint quite weather it's off or just a quirk.

Feel is full bodied but drinkable. Not quite chuggable as it is quite filling, but it's a decent table beer. Medium finish and feels quite malty.

Overall if it was cheaper and less hyped up I'd like it a lot more, but for the impression it makes on non-beer drinkers I'd expect something a bit more crisp, amd refreshing. Everthing is there but I've certainly had a lot better. Closer to a hoppy American lager than a pils, although still better than a lot of euro cheapos."
Stella Artois,4.55,"If there is no Carlsberg, this is my go to beer. I also have fond memories related to this beer as it was my beer of choice during my college years so it holds a special place in my heart. Taste is exceptional, smells fresh and grainy and its golden colour is a thing of beauty."
Stella Artois,4.87,"Such a good beer this is my #1 goto.

Taste like a beer should taste, no added fancy flavors or crazy biterness, just a good European beer! Belgium sits between France and Germany, 2 countries who make arguably europes best beers. I can taste both influences, it is hard to describe. I have had atleast a thousand beers but I do not expect to find anything better than Stella. Good beer!"
Stella Artois,3.15,"not really worth a full review, but for me it's a nice middle ground between cheap beer and more premium, complex offerings. It's like cheap beer+."
Stella Artois,2.09,"This used to be a pretty decent beer 20 years ago, as I recall, but now it is bad. Tastes like soap and burnt caramel with a hint of pee soaked diaper. I have never actually had a pee soaked diaper, but this must be what it tastes like. Very bad, embarrassingly bad. Not something I would ever want again. Really quite awful. Tart, metallic, oily, with a slight hint of barf. AVOID."
Stella Artois,3.73,"Color is a light gold color, with a fine white foam. Pulls a nice head but dissipates fast. Carbonation is decent. Smells citrusy, light and a hint malty. Flavor is ok. Light citrus note, malty and smooth. Fairly boring though. Overall its a alright easy drinker, nothing special but not bad."
Stella Artois,3.53,"From a can dated bb 3-23-23

Nice white sticky head with lace and clean looking pale gold color.

I'll get back to you on the smell, wheat crackers - orange rind hop notes, produce dept..

The malt is not too sweet but picks up a bit of honeyed barley, nice mild drying hops.

Smooth, slick, and refreshing with light carbonation.

I like this beer even compared to many $11 a six craft beers, yet when you get it on sale and get twice as much for the same price, well then it is really hard to beat."
Stella Artois,3.16,Mi!d aroma with nothing really coming foward. Taste was balanced without any distinguishing character. A bit thin feel with a not much aftertaste. A good middle of the road beer. Too bad we can't drink the recipe from 600 years ago.
Stella Artois,3.5,have not had this bee in years - tryed one and it was a nice lager =but nothing great - was let don that it was brewed in St Louis now rather fake advertizing
Stella Artois,2.44,"This one has been ubiquitous throughout the years, and some folks find it delicious. I am not one of them. Perhaps too dry, perhaps hop characteristics not working for me. Yuck"
Stella Artois,2.44,"I first met Stella in Antwerp, Belgium in 1991 working on a merchant cargo ship during Desert Storm. After the first taste at the nearest pub in port we've been steady daily since then. I found it to be consistent worldwide until now. Can't explain but the tastes is off. St. Louis water source? Not as bad as canned Stella but I don't like it. Sorry girl I'm going to miss you.
Bring back the import."
Vanilla Porter,3.35,"Poured from a 12oz can best by January 29th 2023

On the poured a khaki 2 finger head formed, then started slowly dissipating. Body is a dark brown that lets some red light through. Low carbonation and no lacing.

Smell is not very clean. Kind of smells like guinness and super cheap lager got together. Some vanilla and chocolate come through, but this smells kinda dirty.

Taste loses most if not all of the dirty beer vibe. Its a pretty traditional if not a bit average porter. Sweet and a bit vanilla-y so not bad but I wish it was smoother and maltier.

Feel is light for the style. Slightly mouthcoating, but it finishes dryer than expected. It honestly feels a bit conflicted. Not bad but this beer is all over the place.

Overall it's another Breck brewing beer. They really aren't my favorite brewery out there, but they aren't the worst. It's a dark beer that has almost nothing wrong with it, except for the fact that it's lacking identity. A vanilla dark beer that wants to be drinkable and a crowd pleaser but still coming off as craft, and sellable alenought that A-B can sell it nation wide."
Vanilla Porter,2.8,"Look: Dark red, no head

Smell: I can’t really describe it, but it smells good

Taste: Watery to me, not what I was expecting at all, hint of vanilla

Feel: Watery. Nice after taste

Overall: It’s fine, that it. Nothing more, nothing less."
Vanilla Porter,3.55,Pour a very effervescent dark copper with slightly less than a finger of head. The nose has mild vanilla notes. The vanilla is assertive in the flavor but there's not really a corresponding roast to counteract the sweetness of the adjunct.
Vanilla Porter,3.98,"Great Vanilla Taste. Full of flavor, and is not very heavy at all. Definitely would recommend!"
Vanilla Porter,3.53,"From a can. Caramel color with a thin layer of tan colored head. Smells of roasted malt, a little faint. Medium body, well carbonated. Roasted malt and vanilla flavors. Exactly what the name promises."
Vanilla Porter,3.37,"Not my style, but I can appreciate it. Bitter, coffee, nutty, and a little chocolate."
Vanilla Porter,2.89,"Almost no scent when the cap comes off, this porter developed a nice tannish head but quickly lost it. The color is a very transparent reddish mahogany and is accompanied by the subtlest vanilla and a little cream... like the liquid accompanying a chocolate-covered cherry. The taste is totally vanilla, kind of like what my younger self imagined vanilla extract would taste like. It feels very much like a cream soda... round, easy to drink, and some carbonation going down. This is fine, I may get it again if in the mood for a lighter porter in warmer weather."
Vanilla Porter,2,"Look: Dark brown to black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Minimal lacing.

Smell: Vanilla with some light chocolate.

Taste: Very disappointing taste. The vanilla wasn't perceived whatsoever and left me with a horrible lingering aftertaste.

Feel: Medium to high carbonation.

Overall: Very disappointed with this one, particularly the taste. The vanilla wasn't at all noticeable and the flavor profile was unexceptional that left me with a bad aftertaste."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.34,"Jet black body, opaque; thick, frothy, light tan head. Rich, sweet aroma; dark roasted grains; cocoa and chocolate; dark roast coffee. The taste follows along with and amplifies the smell characteristics; milk chocolate and coffee; moderate bitterness throughout; mild booziness. Heavy body; smooth and glassy; silky; slight alcohol dryness offsetting the overall sweetness.

A wonderful imperial stout that delivers a lot of sensory goods.

Pouring temperature: 48 °F; canning data: LAUGH IT UP FUZZBALL 11/08/21"
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.8,"Great beer. World class to be honest. All malt does the job - roasted character, big malty body, bitter but sweet, that roast malt bitterness. A lot of espresso, some mild chocolatey character. It's a great beer, it harkens to the best of the all malt stuff out there and at a really good price point."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.61,"This is one of the best ad-junk free stouts I have ever had the pleasure to drink.
Poured black as the Empire’s ill will with a medium brown, short and dense head that left regular lacing.
Smelled faint to my nose, but that’s normal, what I did get was malty goodness.
The taste was excellent, full and rich in depth of malts, very little bitterness at all. So good.
The feel, ideally weighted for the style, encourages a slow pace but begs for another sip.
OA, really enjoyed this one, if you can find it, try it!"
Imperial Stout Trooper,3.58,"Thanks to Roguer for this one. 12 oz can (dated Laugh it up, fuzzball 11/8/21) Poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solid and dense black color with 3/4 inch of medium brown color that had very good retention and very light lacing.

Strong roast at the front of the nose, yet it didn't border on coffee. Solid malts, and a light bit of chocolate were behind the roast.

Similar on the tongue, with the roast coming across a bit stronger, and lingering on the finish.

The body was fairly typical for the style; smooth, even, and with a finish that started sweet, but dried out nicely.

Drinkability was good, especially on this wet, rainy, stormy, late autumn day here in the PNW.

Overall, a very well done example of the style. Would be in rotation if local to me. A must-try if you see it."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.17,11/29/21 canned 11/10. Liked much better than the taste @ NEB. Roasted malt. Espresso. Nicely balanced. Not sweet or bitter. Go to stout.
Imperial Stout Trooper,3.96,"It’s a very good stout. Rich, dark, heavy. Potent."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.25,"Brew: New England Brewing Co.– Imperial Stout Trooper

Intro: 750 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Pitch black, opaque. Generous head and lacing that remained through the pour.

Smell: Rich malty aroma not cluttered by “Addjunks”. No barrel aging, just grains, and lots of them

Taste: Followed aroma. Roasted grains, maybe a hint of chocolate but no barrel, no coconut, no gummy bears. Just old school stout. Quite refreshing in today’s time

Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel. Leaves a slight film of aftertaste of the roasted grain.

Drink: Very enjoyable to have a change of pace from all the “Addjunks”. It’s a sipper, one that will take a session to consume.

Conclusion: I was very pleased to have the opportunity to try this one. It ticked off a top stouts list and it also ticked off a Connecticut beer. On top of that, it tasted great and didn’t leave me feeling bloated. Definitely try it if you run across it."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.47,"500ml bottle, bottled 12/2014

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge

S- bold roasted malt on the nose gives aromas of chocolate, molasses, rum soaked raisins, stewed figs, black licorice, brownies and caramelized sugar. Even picking up some port-like aromas

T- bold flavors of chocolate, roasted barley, figs, dates and raisins to open. Mid-palate gives notes of black strap molasses, anise, prunes, black cherry and char. The finish gives a hint of faded hops, as well as dark chocolate, roast and fig on the linger

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a thick and velvety, slightly warming finish

O- you just don't find very many great straight up RIS's these days. This has held up remarkably well and is still better than most of the better RIS's available today."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4,"Pours a black color with a thin, tan head that lasts forever but leaves minimal lacing.

The smell is loaded with peanut butter and little chocolate underneath.

The taste is slightly bitter, strong peanut butter, chocolate, and a of char on the finish.

The mouthfeel is medium/low carbonation but very smooth with a slightly thick body.

Overall, this is really nice. I was worried it would be too sweet, but it's not at all. The chat on the end really adds to the beer."

Review
2018 vintage on tap at the brewery

L: The color of the beer is jet black with a brown head. The glass arrives with a 2 finger head that has good retention leaving nice webbed lacing as the beer is consumed.

S: Chocolate, dark fruits, toasted malt and grain, and just barley perceptible is a note of highly fermented maduro tobacco.

T: On the front end I get waves of dark chocolate which follow through to the finish, In the mid palate I get the dark fruits (plum and raisin) starting to mix with toasted malts. The toasted malt fully asserts itself on the back end where it is complemented by some toasted grains and tobacco notes.

F: Full bodied with a decent amount carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy as it washes over the palate and goes down the gullet finishing with a slight dryness.

O: At two years young this is an amazing beer. Aging most definitely added quite a bit of character on both the nose and palate. Just some great stuff here. If you get a chance to visit the brewery one should try it side by side with the 2020 and 2019 to really get a sense of how it evolves over time. What a great stout."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.1,"Canned on 11/18/20; consumed on 1/12/21

Pours a dense, deep black body capped with over a fingers of thick, fluffy, light mocha foam; excellent head retention recedes steadily to a half-finger of rich, creamy cap, ample, frothy collar, and firm, webby layers of lacing caked to the walls of the glass.

Aroma offers ample dusty cacao accented with bittersweet, nutty characteristics along with raisin and soft vanilla bean lurking in the background; lightly roasted malts and more heavily roasted grains are more pronounced over the middle as distant dark fruits show plum against dark chocolate into the close.

Taste opens with waves of milk chocolate and a sweeter, roasty coffee tone reminiscent of vanilla latte; hazelnut husks deepen toward baked toffee and plummy esters over the mid-palate, while on the back end dark chocolate and a delicate smoke is integrated into a pillowy, malty char easing to lighter suggestions of burnt coffee and grassy hops on the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body bolstered by a slightly oily texture and a fluffy, rounded, moderate-light carbonation; a soft, malty roast brings a grit over the mid-palate, persistent and drying steadily to mesh with the plush, boozy warmth spreading over the finish.

A rather stoic, delicate take on the style, this Russian Imperial Stout impresses its bittersweet malts in a calm and practiced fashion, leaving a complex and wholly palatable profile in near-perpetual equilibrium with high-level consumability."
Imperial Stout Trooper,3.81,"750 mL bottle, 2009 version. Opened 22 Dec 2020. Tryna leave this year on a high note.

Poured in 0.3 L Prairie Teku.

Opens with a faint hiss. Small brown head. Lightly carbonated. Vanta black in color. Aroma is strong, chocolate, some coffee, alcohol, slightly burnt. Starts with unsweetened cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, toasty. Medium thick body. Lots of cocoa. Moderate bitter sweet through the middle. Alcohol is only slightly warming. Roasty chocolate finish.

Good but probably was a lot better circa 2012..."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.03,"Bought two sets of cans, one the 2020 masked version. Decided to try that one.

Probably a mistake to open so soon.

It looked nice, smelled nice, but fell way short in the taste.

Not bad, but very ""light"" mouthful for what should be a nice heavy drink.

Will revisit.

Update: definitely better from the non-masked can. Amazing huge head, and better tasting. Nothing amazing but good."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Inky black pour with 1.5 fingers of mocha colored head. Great ring of lacing.

S: Rich and roasty. Dark chocolate and Italian roast coffee.

T.F: Bittersweet roasted malts... strong chocolate and espresso. Vanilla comes in later... some baked raisin, but mostly cocoa and roast. Medium bodied... smooth carbonation.

O: A very solid RIS. Big flavor... a little boozy but very drinkable. Great cold weather beer."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.26,"A: opaque; very dark brown in color; even with a relatively gentle pour, I couldn't get all 12 oz. into a 16 oz. snifter - a 4 finger finely pored medium brown head that receded to a thin cap; nice lacing;

S: deeply roasted grain, milk chocolate, and vanilla;

T: follows the nose from start to finish; moderate bitterness at the end;

M: full bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish; hides the ABV well;

O: dangerously easy to drink really nice flavor;"
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.46,"*A 2013 bottle was consumed for this review

Appearance - The beer poured a heavy black color with sizable 2 inch head crowning the glass.

Smell - The beer had a rich chocolatey stout nose.

Taste - The front was very chocolate forward, followed by vanilla and raisin notes. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, but it was not tooth enamel rotting. The roastiness continued to the aftertaste. I would say this brings to mind aged or a lighter version of regular Dark Lord.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation seemed to have largely escaped in the giant head after the pour. The body was smooth.

Overall - Even if the label may seem gimmicky, this is a great beer with age on it."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.01,"Thanks to ActonBrewer for sending this bottle to me back in the day. Reviewed from (very) long-standing notes. Consumed on 1/21/18. Poured from the 2011 vintage 750 mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Very dark brown, almost opaque, but has retained quite a good bit of visible carbonation. Forms a solid finger’s worth of brown head with good retention. This is very, very pretty.
As an aside, but related to appearance - amazing label. I appreciate the tongue in cheek approach to what I'm sure was a C&D letter from the movie people.

S: Roasted malts and chocolate. Caramel and tobacco. A good bit of roastiness to the malts. Nice roasty aroma. As it warms, maybe a touch of cola-like smell?

T: Roasted malts, chocolate, and caramel. A fair amount of bitterness here as well. There’s a mild amount of cardboard oxidation unfortunately, but it does stay mild. Some tobacco and a bit of old library books. Sweet roasted malts with a moderate roast (maybe some hop bitterness too?) at the swallow.

M: A nice thick body for style. Alcohol flavors are surprisingly well-hidden. Carbonation has maintained at a good level despite the nearly seven years aging.

O: This was pretty tasty. The oxidation doesn’t detract much at all, though it is noticeable in this bottle. Strikes a nice balance between sweet and roasty flavors, and enough of the tobacco earthy flavors to add to the complexity. Pretty darn good - glad I had the chance to try it."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.09,"Poured from a 12oz can stamped ""PUT CAPTAIN SOLO IN THE CARGO HOLD 11/20/19"" to a diagonally cut tumbler.
Black opaque body with a brown frothy head that fades to a ring within about two minutes.
Aroma is mild, sweetened dark chocolate, mild coffee.
Taste follows nose. Its a little sweeter than I like in a stout, but the coffee finish is nice. The 9.5% is not sensed until about 5-10 seconds after swallowing.
This is an oily stout with a firm body.
Overall, not bad, not great."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.11,"Poured on draft at the brewery.

Pours a pitch black color with 2 fingers of creamy tan head. The head leaves a beautiful crown of lacing as it settles into a thin layer of foam.

The aroma brings notes of rich dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, and fresh coffee. Simple but pleasant.

The flavor is more bready and malty, but there's plenty of chocolate notes as well as coffee and a touch of caramel. Like the nose, it's relatively simple but very pleasant.

The feel is full bodied with soft carbonation. Exceptionally creamy, chewy, and smooth. The alcohol is non-existent.

Overall, a great imperial stout that's not overly complex but everything it does is top notch. Very flavorful and surprisingly drinkable."
Imperial Stout Trooper,4.28,"Pretty good stout. Normal dark stout appearance, thick foamy head. Smell of rosary dark malt. Taste is malty, hints of chocolate and coffee. Medium body, no oiliness. Definitely worth trying. Thanks @PatrickCT."
Imperial Stout Trooper,5,"Without a doubt the best stout I have ever had. Rich and chocolaty with a hint of coffee. Has serious potential for aging but drinks amazing even young. Extremely limited release, so snag these when you can!"
Imperial Stout Trooper,5,"chocolate mousse of a head, beautiful silky full texture with a long finish... this is the best stout I have ever had (DEC 2018 batch)"
Starry Noche,4.3,"To be clear this is absolutely a desert beer. Recommended to be had in s 4-6oz glass. Extremely thick dark color resembling black syrup. No head or carbonation. There’s a large amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut aromas. Looks, smells and tastes of hazelnut syrup. A little bit goes a long way. Arguably limited to no bourbon taste all hazelnut and chocolate syrup. Very unique goes well at the end of a meal with desert.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately."
Starry Noche,3.63,"This one pours an exceptionally thick looking dark black color, with a small head, and a bit of sticky dark lacing.

This smells like incredibly sweet melted milkshakes – it smells good, but it’s just ridiculously over the top.

There’s an absurd amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut on the nose here – like a high quality hazelnut coffee thing. Like, it’s certainly tasty, objectively, but it’s just so over the top. More than 1 oz of this is more than enough. There’s basically no barrel, it’s just hazelnut, vanilla, and chocolate syrup overload.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately."
Starry Noche,4.97,"For starters: absolutely loved batch 2 (from last year as well. BUT, that is not why I’m here reviewing this magical moment…

My wife got me this one as a X-mas gift some time back, and I’ve been saving it for an occation… with yesterday being that day. The bold 600 ml bottle of B1 is looking really bubbly/curly when pouring in glass- but also: The nose is completely out-of-this-world, bursting with chocolate, hazelnuts and the thickest body imaginable. Mouthfeel is simply outstandingly incredible! This is quite possibly the best beer I’ve had- at least among the top 3. Long lasting, delicious taste that lingers. So happy I got to experience this one!"
Starry Noche,2.52,"Headlessly viscous burnt black with brown edges, the ominous appearance can't even begin to hint at just how HOLY SHIT WEIRD this 2021 bottle truly is.

Hazelnut paste quickly morphs into cashew cheese and buttered popcorn pot de creme that even verges into popcorn Jelly Belly, as one friend put it. But then my old lady described its nose as dirty dish rag and now I can't smell anything but.

We all had different glasses from different houses and this was our first pour during this bottle share, yet we all had the same offensive experience.

The mouthfeel is otherwise that thick and luscious, almost carbless globularity often hyptastically sought after these days, but not typically my own cup of tea. It clung ever so desperately to the kitchen sink as we drained pour the remaining putrescence.

How b2 has an over 4.5 rating on UnTappd is beyond me. What a bunch of sick, palate-wrecked liars. Speaking of, Anchorage's Sent By Liars is a far superior pastry stout if you're looking for something slightly more accessible that features these adjuncts."
Starry Noche,4.46,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours THICK like motor oil. Wow. Black with almost black head. The nose is incredible. Mostly hazelnuts upfront. Liquid hazelnut cream. Nutella all the way. It's almost hard to pick up much else. Over some time just sitting with the nose, I start to get some dark toffee, coconut, and more milk chocolate. Not a lot of barrel there.

The taste is insane. More dimensions than the nose. Definitely still getting the hazelnut as the dominant flavor, but also picking up some bourbon, toffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet dark fruit. I might say it's a bit too sweet, which is where I dock it a few points. Otherwise, the taste is really nice.

The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thick and creamy. I would say this is the thickest and creamiest stout I have ever tasted. Definitely a treat."
Starry Noche,3.03,WTF. Hazelnut butter. Just too buttery sweet.
Starry Noche,4.56,Definitely solid but a tad too sweet for me!
Starry Noche,4.54,"2021 bottle.

Hazelnut bomb, but in all the best ways. It’s a bit oily and finishes bitter, but when paired with the coconut and thick stout base, it all combines for an amazing experience. And for the price point? 100% worth it every time."
Starry Noche,4.15,"500 mL bottle. Inky black. Smells of coconut and hazelnut. A little bourbon behind. Tastes of bourbon, lots of hazelnut, coconut, sweet chocolate, roasted malt. Harsh oaky bitterness in the finish, but it balances the sugar. Absurd pastry deliciousness."
Starry Noche,4.74,"A shameless explosion of blended barrels and adjuncts that stole my heart, incredible. Black oil appearance with a short lived brown cap. Smell bursts forth with hazelnut, coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, backed with complex barrel flavors. For the taste I must once again admit I am a hazelnut fan, so this was paradise for me, huge rich hazelnut and chocolate dance amongst the oak and bourbon soak coconut, vanilla, faint dark roast coffee, caramel, and nutella. Feel is thick, chewy, warm, has a hint of nuttiness but way more so rich, full and decadent with the weight. I loved starriest night so it makes sense why I adored this, beer of the year entry only 21 days in!"

June 28 canning - just shy of 7 weeks old.
A delicate flower: so measured, seamlessly executed and well-balanced, it’s difficult to parse.
Orange jellies, yeah, but leave it on the palate + it unfolds into orchard, tropical and flavours I don’t even associate with Citra. Lingers endlessly, shifting in tone and intensity.
And, like Heady, I wouldn’t call it NEIPA, but it gives a lot of those same notes.

Pours a dull orange with a loose, 1/8th inch head, off-white head embedded with pinpricks and ringlets that quickly disperses into a thin, tight band around the shoulders. Clarity is slightly haze. Nose expresses bright notes of mandarin navel oranges and a hint of pith. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of light, crackery/biscuity malts. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an assertive carbonation and a kiss of dryness at the finish. Overall, well-crafted and well-balanced."
Double Citra®,4.08,"Canned 8/9/22.

L: Pours a hazy dark gold with a surprisingly small white head that rapidly thins to a film. Small bits of lacing.

S: Aromas of orange and lemon-lime, albeit faint.

T: Taste follows nose up front, remains in middle, then finishes with a nice dry bitterness.

F: Seems under carbonated and a bit flat.

O: Slightly off to the point that this may just be a bad can, at least by Hill Farmstead standards. Even so, the citrus flavor is well presented."
Double Citra®,4.51,"Dark gold clear pour from a can into a Willi - the best way to describe most HF IPAs is that they're just so clean, and balanced. Not an oversaturated mess like a lot of the beers coming out currently. This was really enjoyable - I was a little surprised that I didn't get punched in the mouth as much with the hops, but surprise does not equate to disappointed. This is an excellent beer - glad I finally got my hands on to one of these."
Double Citra®,4.11,"Cloudy, dirty gold color. Solid two-finger head which lumpily and slowly recedes, leaving a spider web of lace on the glass.

Dry, weedy aroma of plenty of post-boil dry hopping. Very vegetalThere's also some alcohol warming, oily pale malt smell.

Moderate body (which is thinner than I expected from Hill Farmstead. The carbonation is elevated making the beer spritzy. The malt portion is lighter but lasts throughout the tasting. The Citra hop is also present throughout the tasting. Less oily than the smell implies but there's still some background alcohol warmth. Long bitter aftertaste."
Double Citra®,4.74,The best IPA - rocks Tree House.
Double Citra®,4.77,"Light on the carbonation. Hazzy darker yellow. Very easy to drink. On the front there is nothing but offensive deliciousness and on the back a hoppy bitter taste that lingers on the tongue. Delicious, simple, succinct."
Double Citra®,4.38,"On tap at Blackback Pub, Waterbury. Very nice showcase of Citra -- tons of rich orange, dankness, spiciness, and rounded out by a lightly cheese-like yeast character. The oat-heavy malt bill makes for a pillowy soft mouth feel.

88/100"
Double Citra®,4.4,"Canned on 10/6/21; consumed on 10/28/21

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.

Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays."
Double Citra®,5,"I live in Maine.
I thought the best beer made in America was DINNER .....Maine Beer Co.
I was wrong.
The best beer made in America is Double Citra .... Hill Farmstead.
Incredible .... hard to find .... dirt road ... no reception.
It's worth it."
Double Citra®,4.86,"L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass.

S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow.

T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8%

F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering.

O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat. I grabbed this at the brewery today in a can and was so excited to have it - I'm looking forward to having it again once things open up a bit and growlers are back. Grab some cans while they are still around if you are within driving distance within VT."
Double Citra®,4.67,"These are one of the kings of beer period. I love me some Citra, and this showcases it more than enough in an almost perfect way."
IPA,4.34,In the same vein as Bell's Two Hearted only this one has more dimensions to the taste. Fairly good IPA that's decent on the price. Recommended for hopheads looking to try America's classics.
IPA,4.88,"Best IPA ever. Makes me proud to be from Colorado. Such a clean, clear IPA, incredibly well balanced."
IPA,3.16,"If this were marketed as an English IPA, I’d rate it higher. It’s marketed as an American IPA. I’d like more hops bitterness."
IPA,3.46,"2022-05-01
19.2oz can served in a nonic pint glass. Dated (best by) 06/15/22. Wife bought it in Phoenix last week and brought it home in a suitcase.

Pours a mostly clear amber-gold with a big head and moderate to high carbonation. Smell is a little grain, a little grapefruit rind, some hay.

Taste is some grain and some end-of-life hops. Old hay, mustiness. Vague bitterness.

Mouthfeel is medium. Overall...it's not bad. I imagine it's better fresher. I probably wouldn't rate it if it wasn't clearly within the best by date."
IPA,4.11,"Pours a bit cloudy, nice bright gold nice white, great lacing. Grapefruit, pine a bit of sweet malts. Taste is similar, great bitter finish, some sweetness. Medium bodied great carbonation, rising the whole time. When I think great IPA'S, I think 2hearted and Centennial, I guess I can ad Odells IPA to the short list."
IPA,4.07,"Close to crystal clear pale, leaning dark side of pale. Clumpy white head with nice retention and some decent lacing.

Aroma is slightly piney, grapefruit, very minor fruity note and some toasty malt presence.

Taste confirms a nice grapefruit citrus, pine less present and the same toasty malt presence and just the slightest touch of sweetness.

Drink very easy, medium body, dry and crisp with a nice bitterness to bring it all home; has a nice resiny sappy feel to it.

If you like classic IPAs you’ll love this beer."
IPA,4.74,Live the color. Perfect balance of citrus/floral and bitterness. This is my go to daily.
IPA,4.4,"Pours a deep gold with good head and lacing. Smell of herbal hops, citrus. You can tell it’s gonna - taste - herbal, piney, lots of bright citrusy hop, grapefruit and orange, super balanced and a little dry. This is my go to shelf IPA in this area and it’s everything I look for in the style. It’s a 95-96 on tap for sure. If you like IPA’s and have this option then buy with confidence and enjoy this fine beer, cheers!"
IPA,4.25,"22oz can poured into a a low ball

A- pours a clear golden color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

S- classic west coast IPA aroma; citrus peel and resinous pine. Just a hint of underlying breast malt

T- zesty grapefruit and juicy orange up front, followed by resinous pine and some grassy notes. The finish gives a toasted malt undertone, with a linger of citrus and pine

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and finish

O- classic and well done west coast style IPA"
IPA,3.87,"Comes in a burnt golden orange color. Translucent with a slight haze. Creamy white head with great retention and lacing.

The aroma is sweet oily orange and grapefruit, a bit of caramel/bread crust, maybe a touch of soapy floral.

The flavor is pink grapefruit and sweet tangerine, oily citrus for days; slightly toasted bread with a hint of caramel, smacks with a slight sweetness on the finish. Moderate bitterness balances this out a little bit, but this isn't a particularly bitter IPA, either.

Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, oily and slick with a sticky residual finish.

A solid IPA. I wish it was a little drier and/or slightly more bitter, but the juicy citrus taste is very pleasant."
IPA,4.03,"12oz can, best by 12/02/21.

Appearance: Mostly clear golden yellow with a massive white head. Lots of lacing to boot.

Smell: Floral, bready, citrus.

Taste: A lot like the smell, but orange citrus at the start, bready malt, then a long lingering citrus peel / grapefruit / pine bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Smooth, light carbonation, sticky on the teeth.

Overall / Drinkability: Very hoppy, but quite enjoyable. I do need to have food with it though, as the bitter hops are tiring out my palate."
IPA,5,My favorite beer and the best American IPA that I've ever tasted. This is a great beer!
IPA,3.87,"Pours a clear golden orange, moderate lacing. Nose is orange peels, light resin and pine. Sports some solid bitterness and a good amount of hop spice, even some clove notes along with them. Finish is dry and is a very refreshing drink. Glad to stumble into this one at the Omaha airport."
IPA,3.56,"Ultimately a let down. Look was great with nice lacing. Smell was kinda flat. The beer felt more like water than anything else, even if there were notes of hops and lemon in the middle. Generally disappointed."
IPA,4.52,"Found this in Austin, Tx for 1st time. Only took 1 taste to know I was going to enjoy this Colorado beer. A very pleasant different IPA."

Look- pours a beautiful clear light orange body with a nice 2 finger head. Beautiful lacing
Smell- huge pineapple and pine with a slight mango ..really catty I love it
Taste- awesome balance huge pine and mango upfront with a nice bitterness on the back end. But it's balanced by a clean maltiness. Very exceptional ipa
Feel- mouth feel is dry and crisp
Overall this beer is fuckin awesome!!! Old school ipa!!"
Marshmallow Handjee,4.34,"Midnight black with a dark mocha head. No real retention or lacing.

Chocolate, vanilla and plum stand out most in the nose. I really enjoy the fruitiness behind what is some very strong brownie batter and vanilla.

The taste is pretty similar. Loads of vanilla without it seeming artificial. High quality brownie. Fruit complexity underneath. And lots of heat.

Oily slick feel with soft fizz.

Probably overhyped, but still very nicely done. The flavors are all intense without being over intense."
Marshmallow Handjee,4.83,"Just because it can't be perfect, I guess, but it's damn close.

L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.
S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.
T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.
F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.
Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good."
Marshmallow Handjee,4.64,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well.

Served from a 750mL bottle. Light blue wax. Allowed to warm ~45 minutes at room temperature after removal from the fridge. Reviewed from notes."
Marshmallow Handjee,4.9,"Been hunting a long time for this one and finally landed a 2019 bottle.
Remarkable how little this tastes like a regular Darklord. It's fairly sweet which i generally don't like, but the barrel presence compensates enough to make it really enjoyable. It delivers on all fronts with ton's of vanilla, chocolate notes and some heat from the barrel. It's also nice and thiccc."
Marshmallow Handjee,4.81,"2020 in 2022. Also had the 2021 and very similar to 2020.
Look - fantastic thick black with a great thick tan head and big lacing.
Smell - roasty malt caramel barrel vanilla
Taste - fantastic vanilla marshmallow caramel woody barrel
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - just incredible"
Marshmallow Handjee,4.54,Bottle courtesy of JohnnyHops.
Marshmallow Handjee,4.59,"Brewing pastry stouts before pastry stouts were cool, the imperial stout that Dark Lord used to be has trended sweeter, more sultry, heavier and stronger as time has passes. Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.

With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.

Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste."

A - Dark golden orange color with moderately dense, bright white lacing that's very creamy looking.

S - Dank passion fruit, peach, and citru with dank, spicy citrus rind on the nose.

T - Dank citrus and peach take center stage on this one followed with pineapple, spicy citrus rind, and some peppery notes.

M - Big medium body with a soft, smooth texture

O - As expected, this is a pretty fantastic D-IPA. Not a 100 (IMO) but it's up there!"
Double Galaxy,4.62,"This is very close to a perfect IPA in my mind.
Great representation of Galaxy hops.
Nice white head. Sticks around.
Smells like candied pineapple and bubble gum.
Taste has the pineapple on the front but a nice bitter backbone.
Body isn’t too thick which makes it remarkably drinkable"
Double Galaxy,4.06,"can into glass
Canned 8 days prior to review.
Medium thick, frothy white head, that quickly thins out. Vivid, cloudy, medium orange color, with much intricate lacing to start off with. The aroma has a candied malt, guava, pineapple, a little mixed sweet spice underneath. Flavors of candied tangerine peel, guava, passion fruit, with a bit of help from some medium toast malt, in the background, to fill out the body and some of the flavors. There is a bright effervescence to it, as well. The finish is largely a mixed citrus peel glow, then a moderate bite."
Double Galaxy,4.75,"Had this at Blackback Pub in Waterbury. Truly an outstanding beer! Excellent color, smell and feel. I wish I was able to drink more than 3 of these… so damn good"
Double Galaxy,3.99,Growler. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Tangy citrus hops dominate the beer. Straight forward with minimalistic malt presence. Clean and refreshing. God body and mouthfeel.
Double Galaxy,4.24,"Canned 09/15/20. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.

A: Hazy gold with 1-2 finger frothy off-white head with excellent retention and sturdy lacing.

S: Herbal undertones to the hop aroma with minty, peppery, melon coming through strongest, with some pineapple and red grapefruit in the background.

T: Flavor is also melon-heavy with some lemongrass and herbal notes in the mid-palate and pineapple and orange in the finish. Pale maltiness is substantial and lends light grainy sweetness. Bitterness is medium with mild fruity esters.

M: The feel is a bit high in minerality for me with a little chalkiness in the finish. Body is medium with low-medium carbonation.

O: A great NEIPA with a more bitter edge which I like. Thanks to my generous friend Eric for giving me the chance to try this exceptional beer from an exceptional brewer — did not disappoint."

As with all the best NEDIPAs, this is a beautiful beer. If it didn't taste and smell so amazing, I'd wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on Instagram, but this matches on the other notes. I love that the ones from the Northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the Midwestern ones that I drink most often (being from Chicago.) I DO wish they'd change to a 16oz can. There's a reason why that's so popular now as a format size, and with the dryer finish, I could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting. There's not as much on the nose as the super fresh Hop Butcher's that I most often drink, but that might be due to the can being a month old. I still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet. It's a wonderfully balanced beer. Will HF ever expand and increase distribution? If so, people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesn't. I'd love to see this in my area. Don't ever pass this one up!"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.53,Pours a dark brownish black. Aroma is milky dark chocolate with coffee. Taste follows nose with roastiness. Mouthfeel is creamy & full. Very nice stout.
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.43,"16oz can.

Pours opaque black with a half inch head of brown. Malted milk balls with dark chocolate and cocoa-dusted espresso beans in the nose. Full bodied with a crushed velvet mouthfeel. Brownie batter with chips of fudge on the palate. Finishes sweet and rich with chocolate cake and faint espresso."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.33,"Pours black, significant brown head. It definitely has that milk stout aroma - tangy/lactose and some alcohol. Taste is roasty with dark chocolate. Some umami/meatiness/soy sauce as well. Feel is somewhat creamy. Overall, one of my favorite milk stouts."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,4.04,"Pours like syrup--smooth and sweet. Very dark brown with a mocha head. It is rich with strong milk chocolate flavor, and subtle coffee flavor underneath. Several good aspects to this stout, but perhaps a bit too sweet, making this lean toward dessert beer."
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,3.4,"16oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.

S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.

T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish.

M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.

O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,"2019 bottle poured at fridge temp but allowed to warm for a while (serving temp is 61 to 64 F). Pours a dark orange/light brown with ZERO head. The nose is intense and insanely good. Tons of sour and funk. Tart. Sour cherries peaches, red wine, lemon, floral, and rhubarb.

The taste is really interesting. The lack of carbonation really makes it punch hard. Tart cherries, lemon peel, funk, sour, oak, red wine, and a slight nutty flavor. Really nice. The alcohol is high but not detectable in any way.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied - low carbonation and dry. Very enjoyable."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.84,"This is my favorite sour, hands down. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of champagne, despite the slender head, and the nose is yeasty with a note of oak. But the flavor is where it truly excels, reminding me of a very fine wine tinged with unripened mango. It's hard to do it justice with words. I could drink St. Good Dog all day, if I could only get my hands on a regular supply."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.25,"One of my Thanksgiving beers. Taste was excellent but the look and feel a bit off.

Poured into a tulip glass. Clear brown color with little head or lacing. Smell and taste of dry red wine. Oak and warm spice. Cinnamon, tart cherries. Went well with the turkey!"
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.23,"L: rich burgundy and starts off with a khaki head
S: whisky sour mash, caramel, and wild flowers
T: cherries, tangy, malt, and molasses
F: good carbonation and mouthfeel

My main issue with this is that you call definitely tell this is an 11% beer. Its about as subtle as a smack to the face. Otherwise, quite delicious."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.65,"The beer is almost no head and offers an aroma of vinegar and fruit.
The description of the beer is spot on with fruity, acidic and balsamic vinegar hints.
The feel is smooth and balanced with a fruity finish that leaves the obvious sour taste.
I liked that the ABV was well hidden. Excellent beer."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,3.89,"Brewed in 2014, bottled in 2015, and imbibed in 2020.

L: Opaque puse color. A complete lack of head.

S: Vinegar, cherries, plums, dark earth mixed with oak chips, and Manischewitz. The shitty kosher wine notes are unfortunately dominant.

T: Vinegar, cherries, dry red wine, plums, and other dark fruits. Mid palate there are wood and earth notes. The finish is extremely dry with a pretty heavy alcohol burn. The acidity throughout the whole palate is overpowering and ruins the beer for me.

F: A sticky medium-light body with almost no carbonation.

O: Not a drain pour, but not something I would purchase again given the price. The bottle was stored in prime conditions at B. United International's underground warehouse (they literally pulled a case and I saw the box opened in front of me) so there should't be any issues on that end. There is a decent amount of complexity going on here but it is overpowered and obscured by the acidity and sourness. I love BFM but this one is a hard pass for me. If wine-beer is your thing I suggest trying Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien Grand Cru (in oak barrels) instead, which in my opinion is a far superior product."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.13,"Pours a murky murky red-brown color with a small top off beige head.
Aroma is cherries, green apple, wine, vinegar,oak and raisins.
The flavour is tart and sour with a lot of sour cherry notes, allong with acidic and vineous notes. I also sense some oak notes, while the background has some slight maltiness. Nicely ballanced. Aftertaste has a nice lenght.
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a medium carbonation and a medium body.
Not sure if i would call this a biere de garde, but it sure was enjoyable."

s) Tart, wine-like, oaky, church-like, incense, plum, more wood shop.
t) Follows all this aroma into a deeper complexity.
f) Wine like, astringent, fruit without sugar.
o) One my favorite beers of all time. Deserves its higher regard."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.52,"Nose of red fruit and balsamic vinegar. Flavor has some brett funk, good maltiness, balanced acetic acid acidity. A little cloudy, no head retention. Red - orange in color. Very complex and interesting but a little aggressive for my preference."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4,"2014 bottle at 11%. Some call this a Bière de Garde and others have compared it to an oud Bruin. Very pleasing rusty burnt orange color. Opaque and inviting looking. For the nose I’m getting strong fruits and leather. The taste is intense. The label says slightly sour but it tastes pretty strong to me. Maybe I’m just sensitive to sour beers as I don’t care for them too much. However the taste has a bright feel to it, a lot like orange juice. Very thirst quenching. The taste also is a lot like smoky leather. Like a high back leather chair in front of a toasty fire. Aftertaste lingers quite a while, especially the sour. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and crisp. Overall I can tell this is a good beer but it’s just not my style due to the sourness."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.28,"Dirty amber-orange body; yeast cloudiness; thin yet lasting off-white head. Initial impression of the smell is fermented cherries but further reflection makes me think of high alcohol and white oak barrel aging. The taste is an intriguing blend of muted caramel malt with a strong sour cherry and nougat combination playing out; tart and mildly boozy. Heavy body; a bit of astringency competing with the residual sugar presence; a sense of alcohol warmth adds to the mix.

First off, the beer strikes me as being more inline with the BA description of Flanders red ale because of its strong wine and sour-like character while there is still a fine level of malt sweetness to be gleaned. Regardless, the beer is unique and intriguing in its character and depth. The oak aging creates added presence and the alcohol presence, while detectable, resides in the background. Different and very nice."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,3.59,"Reddish-brown color, head virtually non-existent, kind of a musty aroma. Taste is tart, but not enough to wince. Fruit flavors of plum and tart cherry. There's an earthy undercurrent too. Amazing how they've buried 11% ABV in the flavor mix. The alcohol content never intrudes. Great old world craft here."

Review: 106"
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.15,"Dark, murky amber, like burnt caramel; limited head retention.
The nose is funky fruitiness, ripe apples in a barn, mild dried fruit, lightly floral; maybe some over-ripe apricot and strawberry.
Amazing, complex flavours, fruity + funky + acidic + umami; almost impossible to describe, it's a taste of its own - apple cider, peach pie filling, dried apricot, red currants. All balanced by cider vinegar acidity and tang; off-dry finish, very long; fine carbonation, light and almost flat (which may be poor handling by the retailer); medium body.

This might not be for everyone, but I love the funkiness and weirdness. Needs more carbonation, but again, that might be the fault of the handling."
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.41,Solid beer with raspberry and dark fruits as well as some sweetness. Very well crafted sour beer with a good sourness and solid taste. Like this beer a lot.
Abbaye De Saint Bon-Chien,4.16,Pours a very cloudy red amber color with a thin foamy head. Head retention is mild. Lacing is good. Pungent sour raspberry aroma. Oaky for sure. Very sour flavor. Raspberry and dark fruits with a lot of oak. Maybe some grape. The sourness is not as pronounced as it is in the aroma. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Well crafted sour.

Poured from a 500mL bottle into a Spiegelau Classics Wheat Beer glass and the remainder in a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is golden amber with slight cloudiness and 12 fingers of white head. Retention is excellent leaving 2 fingers of foam.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of banana, clove, some spice, and a slight musty smell.
The intensity of taste is a little above medium. The flavor has banana, clove, slight tartness, and some spice in the finish.
The thickness is somewhat above medium. In a tall wheat glass, it's creamy with low carbonation if you poor too quickly. In a Teku glass, it's creamy, effervescent, and has a medium level of carbonation. I prefer this beer with a gentle pour in a Teku glass.
Overall, it's world class and I'll buy it ocaisionally. However, Live Oak HefeWeizen is far superior and remains my absolute favorite beer.
This is my 100th review."
Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.94,"Poured from 500 mL bottle into hefeweizen glass
Look: Golden, hazy yellow with 3+ fingers of head with very good retention.
Smell: Hints of banana and citrus. Typical for a great hefeweizen beer
Taste: Just like the equally impressive Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, this beer offers a classic clean hefeweissbier flavor plus a perfect mixture of citrus and banana. It doesn't get much better than this.
Feel: Medium-bodied with good carbonation.
Overall: Like Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, its hard to find any flaws with this delicious beer. Drinking a 500 mL glass of this beer on a warm summer day puts a smile on my face."
Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.24,"Review of younger bottle (1 year, 5 months): 03 July, 202


0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: L1042 (11 Feb, 2021)
Consumed on: 03-july-2022
Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp: 50.4 F


Look:
Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see vague shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass. Huge 3-finger foamy white head slowly dissipates to about 0.25 inches of foam Lacing is OK. I see some yeast 'floaties' in there.

Smell:
Sweet but a bit tart citrus fruits and spicy cloves. Some apricots/peaches. Hints of banana. Black pepper.

Taste:
Follows the nose but with the bananas being more prevalent. The cloves and light citrus tartness persist through the sip and into the aftertaste. Some notes of orange appear, as does a light touch of honey. The cloves, citrus, and mild sweetness are balanced very well.

Feel:
Smooth, soft, and creamy. Nicely carbonated. The body is medium, with an almost unnoticeable lean to the light side.

Overall:
I picked up the newest bottle that I found at my local retailer in order to re-review this excellent Hefeweizen. This younger version has more noticeable cloves and more tart citrus along with less noticeable sweetness. That makes the younger bottle more refreshing than the older one that I had reviewed before. I must admit that I prefer more clovey (is that a word?) and more citrusy Hefeweizens compared to sweet ones.

As a sidenote, while this is a very good warm-weather Hefeweizen, for hot or very humid weather I'd recommend _not_ decanting the yeast into the beer. Drink it as if it was a Kristallweizen in such situations.

0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: L0160 (8 June, 2020)
Consumed on: 10-june-2022
Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp: 52.4 F

Look:
Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see the shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass. Huge 3-finger foamy white head requires sipping to prevent overflow and then dissipates to 1-finger of foam. After a couple of sips, the head is a ring and a very thin cover. Lacing is OK.

Smell:
Ripe bananas and sweet citrus fruits. Touches of oranges and ripe apricots/peaches. Honey. Hints of cloves, Ceylon cinnamon, and black pepper.

Taste:
Bananas and sweet citrus, including oranges start the sip. Cinnamon, cloves, and pepper appear quickly and (mostly) balance out the sweetness. A citrus bite then takes hold and persists through the end of the sip. Notes of orange-blossom honey are present. A light perfume or flower note can be detected. The finish is mildly sweet and citrusy.

Feel:
Smooth, soft, and creamy. The body is medium, with a very slight lean to the lighter side.

Overall:
A top-notch Hefeweizen. My bottle has some age on it and, while some things are definitely muted for this bottle, the beer is still quite flavorful. I will track down a fresher sample and re-review. The beer is quite refreshing and is a great warm-weather Hefeweizen, perfect for a warm afternoon or even evening. It is also a quintessential 'breakfast beer' (such as part of a Bayerisches Frühstück) due to its very noticeable citrus elements."
Ayinger Bräuweisse,4.18,"From a 500ml bottle. Cloudy orange color with a half inch of fluffy white head. Smells of cloves. Medium body. Tastes of wheat, orange peel, and cloves. Very smooth."
Ayinger Bräuweisse,3.51,"Appearance: Pours a mostly clear, light golden color with a mild white head. SRM of 8. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of wheat pale malts, bread malts with cloves and banana. Hints of aspirin on the aroma. (

Flavor: Moderate flavors of pale malts and wheat upfront. Then falls into a German bread malt flavors with some authentic German spices of clove and traces of banana. Leans slightly medicinal with a hint of Band-Aid, but finishes with an authentic German bread spice.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Lower mouthfeel for the style. A slightly flat finish. (3.25)

Compared to Utepils Ewald the Golden 4/3/22: Pours a darker color, stronger head. Milder aromas. More toasted pale malts and medicinal flavors. Less German bread, banana, and clove spices. More authentically German flavors, but the winner here is Ewald the Golden.

Overall: An okay Hefeweizen, but the mouthfeel was underwhelming and this one seemed to drink slightly flat. The flavors are there, but seemed somewhat medicinal. Not overly sweet and somewhat subtle in how it drinks. I picked the American version above over this one, but still enjoyed finishing it. (Final Rating: 3.51)"

Abraxas,4.31,"2021 Variant - did this back to back with the BA version - was badly missing the peppers, which was a big disappointment for me - had the 2019 variant on tap a few years back, and just remember it being fantastic - this was good - not fantastic - I dont' want to make it sound like I didn't enjoy this, but the thing that makes Abraxas great, that perfect mix of the cinnamon, chilis, etc...it just wasn't there on this bottle."
Abraxas,4.25,"Well i traveled north to a beer joint i'd never been to before but i knew they had good ratings and were a well liked store. Mack's Beverage in Parma, Ohio. Well yes, the place was very cool and had a lot to choose from. But i was really surprised to see multiple vintages of Abraxas on the shelf. The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried. There's nothing spectacularly unique about it, but as far as a stout goes, this sets the bar pretty high, manifesting what a stout can be if it's done well and done right. Cheers!"
Abraxas,4.6,"L: Pitch black . An abyss . Carefully poured into a 12oz snifter glass . Absolutely no head or lacing . Straight motor oil .

S: Vanilla , Cinnamon , and chocolate .

T: Vanilla , Chocolate , and coffee upfront . Chocolate on the finish too , as well as cinnamon , and peppers . Warm and spicy on the finish . Somewhat sweet.

F: Thick , silky mouthfeel . A good tinge of mild to low carbonation on the finish .

Overall I think this beer is fantastic . I’m a big fan of stouts . It’s expensive , but I would definitely buy this again ."
Abraxas,4.26,"Got this bottle in December 2017 and the age mellowed out the alcohol burn. It poured as black as ink with a small brown head that faded slowly and left basically zero lacing. It smells of cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and roasted peppers up front, followed by cocoa powder, brown sugar, charred wood and cooking spices. The ABV was quite subdued in the nose.

Tastes of dark chocolate and smoked chili peppers up front, followed by cinnamon, milk chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, roasted grains, cocoa powder, brown sugar, molasses, red wine, charred wood and cooking spices. The flavor has a lot of smoky, charred aspects but still does down easy like a well aged bourbon. The char and oaky components give it some hints of vanilla and campfire smoke, while covering up the ABV. Pretty smooth drinking for a heavy stout, this was quite enjoyable."
Abraxas,4.3,Minimalist dark khaki colored lopsided froth... Minimal retention... Color is an inky black... Huge aroma that can be detected without bringing nose near the glass... Cinnamon... Vanilla... Peppers... Cocoa... Loads of depth and complexity on the nose make this a delight... The complexity follows through to the palate... All the expected characters are present... Nothing dominates... They all ebb and flow lending to the richness and complexity... Full bodied... Sleek... A touch of chalkiness on the finish... World class exquisite brew... Well rounded... Complex... Challenging yet enjoyable... Wonderful beer and wonderful experience...
Abraxas,4.49,"Crowler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, unknown vintage but presumably the latest release from 2021

Yet another legendary Stout acquired at Half Time yesterday! The difference in rankings between this and the barrel aged version of it is shocking to me, at #245 vs #3, respectively. Still, I’m expecting a quality beer with this one. Let’s get into it

Pours jet black with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The peppery spice in the nose is really nice, it combines well with everything. I’m picking up on aromas of chipotle pepper, earthy cinnamon, roasty coffee, milk chocolate, spicy whiskey, light raisin, and vanilla

The balance carries over into taste, with the pepper adding a nice but firm spice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, chili pepper, dates, and vanilla. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, vanilla, spicy whiskey, roasty coffee, and toasted oak

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness

This is a very good beer. The balance is really nice and nothing is overwhelming. I can’t wait to try the BA version"
Abraxas,4.48,"Perennial Abraxas Imperial Stout 2021, 11.5% ABV. Pours black and thick with a one-finger medium brown head that left no lacing but the cap lingered. Nose is chocolate, cinnamon, and faint peppers. Taste follows, weak pepper, plus vanilla. The more it warmed, the cinnamon really popped, nose and taste. Excellent smooth and thick mouthfeel, overall world class. Way better than Prairie Bomb or Stone Xocoveza."
Abraxas,3.93,great mixture of flavors - can't taste the chill peppers mostly cocoa flavor comes thru
Abraxas,4.79,"If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas.

A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.

Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.

Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.

The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.

I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed."
Abraxas,4.65,"A: pours opaque black with a thick, dark brown , 4 finger head that slowly dissolves to a 1/4"" cap. Lots of lacy legging on the sides on the draw down.

S: redolent of cinnamon and cocoa and chillies.

T: roasted malts and chilies up front, with cocoa and cinnamon right behind. The alcohol is buried right behind without being hidden.

F: Viscous and smooth on the tongue. Light to almost non-existent carbonation.

O: A supreme Russian imperial stout with chilies. A little expensive but worth it."
Abraxas,4.53,"750 ml bottle, no bottle date that I noticed on it but it's a 2021 vintage, 11.5% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch or so frothy tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like Ancho chilies, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, cacao nibs and some earthiness. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark bread, coffee and burnt/charred malt flavors. I think all the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and coating with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Easy and enjoyable to drink for sure. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, worth picking up if you get the chance!"
Abraxas,4.67,"Poured from a bottle. Very dark with a thick tan head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, roasted grains, cinnamon and peppers. Very thick mouth feel with flavors of chocolate, cinnamon, peppers and roasted grain. Very unique and it all seems to work together very well. Not something you drink a lot of but something you should try."
Abraxas,4.84,"The first time I've tried this was on Valentines day at a dinner at one of my favorite restaurants w/ beer pairings with Perennial beer. It was one that really stood out and I enjoyed them all. Had it a few months after that because I found it at my favorite beer shop(the only place I know that almost exclusively sells nothing but beer and a small selection of liquor). It was just as good as the first time. The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin. There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em . Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it. One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough! If anyone sees it out in the wild definitely pick it up because it can be quiet hard to come by, even for locals."
Abraxas,4.57,"Drinking 2017 Abraxas and it's fantastic. Deep rich cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla with just a hint of spice. Very well integrated. This is holding up exceedingly well for being 4 years old."
Abraxas,4.71,"Had from a 64kz growler. Pours a thick motor oil black with a tan head that springs up once you stop pouring. The brew has a beautiful tan colored coating around the glass when swirled. It smells like molasses, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hints of toffee. The taste is truly incredible. At lower temperatures the chocolate and alcoholic sweetness take the center stage with vanilla extract like aftertaste. The flavor gets better as it warms and almost taste likes a dark chocolate cinnamon roll. It's very very thick and completely coats the mouth, but it's slightly carbonated and much more refreshing than anyone could ever expect. It goes down illegally smoothly for a 12% beer. Overall very very good, don't pass this up if you have a chance to grab it on tap."
Sculpin,4,"This is an ok IPA, but I always thought it was overrated and find it annoying now that it is distributed everywhere."
Sculpin,4.35,"Got this on draft.

Pours a clear golden color with a small head and moderate lacing.

Smells and tastes of malt and and peppery hops with some tart citrus.

Medium body and carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.

This is a classic west coast IPA"
Sculpin,2.98,Over hyped IMO.
Sculpin,4.41,"Just a bit of haze infiltrating the amber body along with a medium size white head and good lacing. After inhaling everything hoppy, from citrus to pine and everything in between, there wasn't much room for the malts to make a statement. Thought they might take a step forward in the taste, but nyet, still awash in all the hop pleasures. Bold and bitter right thru to the aftertaste. Full-to-bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that is so welcome after weeks of malty marzens and festbiers. Could easily pass for a DIPA."
Sculpin,4.44,"12oz bottles and on tap into a 16oz nonic pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly cloudy caramel amber with a 1.5"" off-white rocky head with very good retention. It is well carbonated right to the end of the pint. Some skeletal lacing and banding.
S: Apricot, peach, light pineapple, pine, raisins, light sweet bread.
T: Earthy apricot, sweet ripe tangerine, lemon peel, mango, juicy pine and toasted grains. It is fairly bitter with pine resin lingering throughout the finish and is moderately sweet and resinous.
F: It has a firm, lightly sticky medium-bodied mouthfeel that is smooth with a long finish. It is not jarring with hops yet they are bold and balanced.
O: I first tried this beer in 2008. A bottle pour produces a bit more foam than does a tap pour. It is an excellent full flavored hop-forward West Coast IPA. It's well balanced hop configuration flavors remind me of the children's breakfast cereal ""Fruit Loops"". It is very excellent in it's style."
Sculpin,4.24,"Canned 1/25/21

This is one of those beers that I had for the first time very early on in my craft journey but never reviewed. From what I remember of my 21st, I had a lot of this and the grapefruit variant, and kinda just stopped going back to them after that. Not for any particular reason, but I started branching out since I had the options. So when I saw this and the grapefruit one lying around recently, I just had to pick them up, even though they were older cans they deserve a proper review

Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

Despite the age on the can, this is still in your face hoppy and fresh, which is really what drew me to this beer more than anything when I first had it. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, pithy grapefruit, coriander, lemon rind, biscuity malt, and light caramel

As I said, I recall the aroma being the high point, and the taste lagging a bit behind, but in this case I think it's the age showing a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, bready malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, and peach. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, and toasted grain

A light medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a slick yet firm beer. Finishes off dry and feels much lighter than the 7% it actually is

This beer is an institution for a reason. An absolute classic which holds up today, but I can only imagine what it was like for people to experience this one in the early days. A treasure of a beer that I think I'll have to come back to more often"
Sculpin,4.89,"This beer, is top tier IPA. It is very bitter, but with character and makes this one of a kind. Meant To wow all those who are tired of the same hazies, same ol imperials, whatever. This beer is unique. Look is obviously excellent, bright and opaque. As for feel, well it goes down with ease, with the feel of a superior beer. Carbonation, nuetrality, and taste that's what you need. If warm, it may not feel so great, due to it's strong flavor.

This beer is worth more than market. It really should be priced a bit more than it's competition, but it's not. So it's a great deal to boot.

Now, the alcohol. This beer hits you. It is totally reliable to make you extra drunk and fast. Be wary and believe me and my fellow Sculpin lovers. This is also added value. Ballast Point will go down in history for this legendary beer. My only complaint may be consistency. It's very strong IPA, so a bit more likely to get an off-batch once in a blue moon"
Sculpin,4.1,Heaven head one in alarm time that as I remember it was very good him reading it because I see its number four
Sculpin,2.18,"This used to be an amazing beer, whoever is brewing it now has destroyed it, I would put it it in the ranks of Goose Island IPA, which is an absolute abomination of an IPA. Truly sad, this used to be an iconic beer."
Sculpin,4.31,"12oz bottle. No dating information found on label nor on bottle.
Clear, deep gold colored body. Active uprising bubble show. One finger of white head, which settles back to a medium cap. Leaves bands of lacing.
Aroma of hops expressing tropical fruits and lemon. Firm malt base.
Taste is old school bitter (70 IPUs). Sweet honey malts. Hops express apricot, peach, and mango, plus some lemon rind.
Medium mouth feel. Excellent carbonation.
This was a major star when the bitter West Coast IPA was in vogue. Now more of a reminder of this IPA style, but well made and crafted."
Sculpin,4.41,"It smells like fresh fruit.  Citrussy but not specific.  It's a sweet smell mostly fruity but a little bit of maltiness too.

It's bitterness first but it's really fresh.  Then there is both citrus and pine flavored hops.  There is that little bit of malt as well.

It's thin but really foamy.  It's smooth and refreshing.  The finish starts off bittersweet but eventually is just bitter.

Overall it's delicious.  It's a refreshing fruity and bitingly bitter IPA.  I give it a 5.2 out of 6."

Kriek De Ranke,4.16,"750mL bottle into a teku glass
Best before: 09-03-2023

Pours a hazy strawberry red color with a fairly large fizzy pink head that dissipates quickly down to nothing. Carbonation appears huge. Aromas of berry jam, pale malts, subtle funk, tart red fruits including of course cherry but also strawberry. There’s a uniqueness to the aroma that differentiates it’s from most lambic, perhaps a product of the blending as it appears this is not 100% lambic but a blend with some other base beer. Regardless i really did the aroma. Taste is much more sour than the aroma implied. Balanced by the big berry notes. some oak, only funk is the burnt plastic kind there’s almost no pungent character which I prefer. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, it’s just so heavily carbonated it’s almost hard to drink without belching or getting hiccups. Never had that happen with a beer before. This also somewhat limits it’s drinkability. Overall, quite a nice beer, but lacking when compared to some of the greatest Belgium lambic.

Kriek De Ranke,3.46,"750 mL bottle. Bright red. Smells of cherries, bitter earthy yeast funk, and a little oak. Tastes of earthy yeast notes, cherry, oak, a little dried grass. Medium body and well carbonated. Not terribly sour, which is nice. Good all around."
Kriek De Ranke,3.95,"Shared 750 ml bottle at Mikkeller Bar, Aarhus. Red color, pinkish off-White head. Dryish aroma of sour cherries and farmhouse. Bone dry flavour with notes of sour cherries and brettanomyces."
Kriek De Ranke,4.18,"Pours a slightly hazy strawberry head; big effervescent to start that quickly falls back to a slight ring, no retention. Nose sour cherry, red wine, red wine vinegar, and oak. Taste is relatively moderate on the sour scale, balanced by a bit of sweet cherry. There a bit of underlying bitterness mid-palate, and the oak shines through as well on the finish. Very refreshing, very enjoyable."
Kriek De Ranke,4.09,"Very hazy orange color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. No retention or lacing. Pungent sour tart cherry aroma. Red wine. Tart cherry and red wine taste with nice sourness. Medium bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation. 3.75, 4, 4.25, 3.5 4.25"
Kriek De Ranke,4.13,"Pours a cloudy, ruby red coloration with a medium, quickly dissipating, fluffy, pink'ish head. Smells of sweet and tart red cherries, citrus acidity and just a hint of funk and earthy/musty oak. Taste is a great balance of mellow, sweet and tart red cherries, but really more tart than sweet, with a light citric acidity and very light, but noticeable funk, as well as just a hint of earthy/musty and lightly tannic oak. Finishes with a light tartness and acidity and some cherries and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

This is a really nice and mellow Kriek that's a blend of Flemish Sour Ale and Lambic, giving this a milder tartness with just a hint of funk, which makes for a rather mellow balance with a great, refreshing drinkability that totally makes up for the lack of complexity if that's what you're in the mood for on a hot summer's day. Very nice balance of sweet and sour notes as well, with the sour notes staying firmly on top, never letting this become too sweet."
Kriek De Ranke,4.45,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.

Just about as good as a kriek can get visually. Gem like ruby body, with an opaque glow. Light column of fine bubbles on the edges and the middle. A one finger off pink to white head is so fine it looks nitrous. It settles with a tall crowned collar of whipped cherry cream. Just gorgeous looking beer.

Aroma is nicely balanced but not large. Soft tangy cherry with low acidity. Has a large herbal part, not quite minty but a sort of sage to thyme green like flavor.

Palate is a simple joy. Clean and light bodied, with a great balance between sour and sweet. Soft cherries in mid palate, with a good light barley dryness and white flour bakery dough. Light fizz that is backed up with excellent cherry flavor and malt depth. Other fruit qualities manage a peek, raspberry, slight citrus oils also.

Great impressive kriek that goes for subtle notes and complexity that is neither overly sour or sweet. Well done."
Kriek De Ranke,4.23,"250ml Keg at Moeder Lambic Fontainas, Brussels (€4.90):
Strong & lively with a lot of tart & cherry kicking things off, the beer was fresh & well-carbonated with some nice sourness in the early going too. I found the beer to be slightly more bitter than expected with the taste but it remained balanced with a nice fruity twist soon after with raspberries, some orange & more cherries featuring alongside a sugar sweetness; excellent stuff & one I'd happily have again."
Kriek De Ranke,3.99,"750ml. Pours slightly murky brick red with small head that dissipates without lace. Nose is musty cellar, tart berries, wood, and some brett. Taste is more sour cherry than the nose suggests, but is not over the top. Not overly sour, but also not overly complex with just a little of the wood and brett notes coming through. Overall, a decent kriek but not one of the best."
BDCS,4.02,"Bringing a little heat to the party, Ozark Beer allows for an extended aged Imperial Stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.

Dark and tawny garnet brown, BDCS '22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. As a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee, caramel, maple, chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose, the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and caramel.

As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close.

Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow."
BDCS,4.11,"12oz can, tulip, 2021 vintage.

Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown.

Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant.

Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength.

Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation.

The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done."
BDCS,4.37,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible.

Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb.

Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes. This was definitely not an overt dessert stout.

Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body.

Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype."
BDCS,4.78,"Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass.

The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth.

It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time. World class and something I'd hoard if I had access to it!"
BDCS,4.29,"2020 version. Purchased in August at the brewery. Opened 2/17/21.

L: Black. Really black. Surprisingly thick caramel colored head that only stays around the edge of the glass. Thin ribbons of lacing that go away.

S: Bourbon, cherry, chocolate, vanilla, and wood. It's all there, and it's impressive.

T: Sweet up front, bourbon in the middle, tamed by the cherry, chocolate and vanilla. More smooth bourbon at the finish.

F: Medium to heavy body, but not as heavy as it looks. Light carbonation.

O: Rich and complex. A wonderful example of the style."
BDCS,4.14,"2020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21

Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.

Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.

Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV."
BDCS,4.48,"2020 vintage opened on 11/22/2020

Pours a think used motor oil color with minimal coffee crema head. Nose is of barrel and vanilla, roasted malts, milk, minimal umami/soy. Taste of sweet milk, chocolate, vanilla, warm barrel character, finishes with a balanced soy flavor. Feel of 2% milk with mild carb. Overall, what a nice treat, great base beer that is exemplified by the barrel."
BDCS,4.6,Very smooth. Incredible. 2020 edition
BDCS,4.55,"L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.
A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.

S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.

T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.
Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.

F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.

O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety! A stellar brew on the nose especially, which deserves to be tried by stout-lovers the world over!"
BDCS,4.11,"Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous.

Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start.

Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose."
BDCS,4.53,"12oz can purchased poured into a nonic.
Aggressively poured in to a Samuel Smith pint glass.

Look- Black as midnight. Sizable rich mocha colored head with great retention, tons of thick lacing. No carbonation streams visible.

Smell- Caramel/toffee type malts, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, bourbon and oak, roasted nuts (praline candies in particular), licorice, toasted dark bread and dark fruits (raisins and dates), a bit of vanilla. Light spice notes.

Taste- Rich caramel malt, bourbon and barrel, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and dried dark fruits, licorice, roasted nuts, burnt sugar, light spicy hops and a bit of cherry and coconut.

Feel- Medium/heavy bodied with an incredibly smooth, pillowy creamy texture. Light bitter finish, soft carbonation on the tongue.

O- This BA IS takes the GD Yeti version and ruins it for me. Insanely good."
BDCS,4.59,"In person trade from jvgoor3786 and poured into an Odell snifter.

Deep thick inky black pour with a tall creamy bubbly head of beige. Very pretty.

Aroma of thick, sappy bourbon barrel, deep chocolate, big molasses, heavy caramel, and suggestions of syruped figs. Wow.

Flavor is just massive. Tons of candied pecan, figs, bourbon, maple, milk chocolate, vanilla and chocolate wafers, candy shell, caramel roll, and molasses. All wrapped up in a bourbon blanket.

Feel is thick, sticky, hot, and burning.

Overall, a nearly perfect barrel aged stout. Incredible stuff. It's like a more wafer-like version of BCBS."
BDCS,4.42,"L: Dark mahogany with a reddish tint. Slight reddish amber head
S: Oak, Vanilla, dark fruits
T: Fudge, vanilla, lots of bourbon. Dark fruits on the finish
F: Super thick. Coats and lingers
O: This is a great beer. Easy sipper. It definitely needs to warm up for all the flavors to come forward."
JJJuliusss!,4.84,Quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. Enjoyed this even more than the King. Accolades fail me at this level of perfection of the style. Effortless drinking and just pure unadulterated enjoyment. Thanks goodness this brewery is a long drive away or they would have all my money.
JJJuliusss!,4.16,"Canned on 7/29/22; consumed on 9/2/22

Pours a turbid, dark orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of rich cap, a massive, fluffy collar, and myriad spattering of chunky lacing tossed around the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.

Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.

A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA."
JJJuliusss!,4.81,"Look - bright orangish thick and creamy with a great white head and sticky lacing
Smell - super tropical citrus scents just jump out at you
Taste - super juicy but dry somehow. tropical citrus very fruity taste without being bitter at alll
Feel - medium full body with a creamy light carb
Overall - just loved this beer!"
JJJuliusss!,4.35,"7/31/22 Canned 4/29. Ultimate ripe citrus fruit bomb. Intense. Thick body. Sweet, soft, pillowy. A once in a while brew, not an everyday favorite."
JJJuliusss!,4.31,"Appearance - The beer poured an unnatural shade of orange with a white head and generous lacing.

Smell - The nose had an orangey nose with a malty backbone.

Taste - The beer tasted more like orange juice than beer. It was like Sunny Delight got poured into a bitter IPA. There was a maltiness amid the body. Bitter orange rind lingered in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick!

Overall - Based on the description, I was expected the beer to be sweeter."
JJJuliusss!,4.44,"Tree House Brewing Co. ""JJJuliusss""
16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT 04/29/22 07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.
Review #7,971"
JJJuliusss!,4.38,"Pours a murky dark orange with two fingers of dense yellowed foam head. Great retention and thick rings of lacing.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.

Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.

Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation.

A top of class NEIPA. Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance."
JJJuliusss!,4.46,"One month old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellowish orange. Medium thick white head leaving a bit of lacing.

Smell: Orange. Grapefruit. Sweet and dank.

Taste: Ripe citrus fruits. Mostly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium sweetness with a zesty, slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp.

Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced. Overall a very good brew and a prime example of the style."
Parabajava,4,"Served from tap in a flared pokal at Consume.

Pours a deep onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises sweet coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, and a twinge of whiskey barrel. The taste brings in more of the same, the coffee attempting to crowd out all else, though mostly in vain. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. A very nice bit of coffee-centric impy goodness."
Parabajava,4.45,"Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, and caramely malts with some mild coffee mixed into the nose. Dark chocolate and molasses mingle for a little sweetness and complexity. Flavor profile is heavy stout, with roasty, toasty, caramely, nutty, and bready malts. Coffee comes in just after the start and lingers to the end. Mild coffee notes. Dark chocolate and molasses add a little further sweetness. Some bourbon and alcohol heat on the backend. Mouth feel is thick and heavy with a surprisingly still texture. Overall, heavy stout with some great coffee notes and some boozy heat too. Good blend of each, allowing the base stout to shine through the mix.

Draft."
Parabajava,4.53,"Extraordinarily rich and flavorful stout. Smell and taste of stewed, sweetened dark berries. Intense dark chocolate. Subtle licorice and dark coffee. Bourbon whiskey background that is more pronounced as it warms - boozy. Excellent head and lacing atop a rich dark brown. Glad to have found it on tap."
Parabajava,4.69,"2019 vintage, 13.2% ABV, 56 IBU, purchased form the cooler at Firestone in September and refrigerated until now (about 5-6 weeks later) poured into 2 snifters from a 12 oz bottle. Off-black color, about 1/8 inch or less of head. virtually no lacing. Wonderful roasted grain and coffee smell, but not as intense as some others like this style. Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous. Overall one excellent beer marred only by the hefty pricetag of $10/12oz and I prefer a little more head retention and a little more coffee-forward smell, which I admit is totally subjective."
Parabajava,4.6,"Look: very dark brown, nearly opaque. Some cola highlights when held to light. Nice frothy mocha head.
Smell: big roasty semi sweet chocolate and coffee.
Taste: much like the nose. A slight bitterness in the finish, but very balanced by semi sweet chocolate."
Parabajava,4.6,Had on tap at FW Propagator.
Parabajava,4.71,"12oz bottle of 2019.

Coffee so well done as complimentary accent. Nose was far more dynamic on the bottle, and the taste was exquisite. More coffee presence than the previous batch. Loved it!"
Pilsner Urquell,4.15,"Look :- Deep reddish gold , foamy head that fades to a ring . Decent lacing

Smell :- Malty .

Taste :- Nice and rounded , flavourful , rich with a mild hop bitterness

Mouth feel:- Nicely mouth coating .

Overall:- Good beer , full of flavour and at 4.4% abv proves that a beer doesn't have to be strong to taste good ."
Pilsner Urquell,4.19,"Grassy, green, and the bitterness rides in as well. Not as snappy as a german pils, but lingers for a while and invites you for another sip. For a macro pilsner, you cannot get any better. Price wise I cannot see how it can be beat. It's a classic that you just cannot hate due to nostolgia."
Pilsner Urquell,3.83,"Look: Golden yellow and clear in the glass with a frothy head that pillows up, slowly puckering away and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Spicy hop notes, pilsner malt, straw, light floral hops, soda crackers, and bread
Taste: Blasts off with a full-on Saaz hop assault that brings spicy and subtle hop notes to the forefront and soon after, cracker and pilsner malt seeps into the mix. Floral and spicy notes take turns being dominate through the finish
Mouthfeel: Full but light, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and clean and crisp on the finish
Overall: A classic and still a winner. I hadn’t had this in some time but need to have it in rotation more often as it’s a Czech Pilsner O.G. that showcases Saaz hops well and hits all the style notes dead-on"
Pilsner Urquell,3.49,"I’ve had this lager on draught in Prague and throughout the CZ.
But my review is from a 12 oz can, poured into a ‘Pivovar Cvikov’ pint glass that, ahem, insisted I bring home with me from Bohemian Switzerland.

Fizzy, herbal, elegant bitterness, skunky from the Czech Republic’s native spicy Saaz hops, the soft water profile sets the standard for the style.
It’s an acquired taste for sure, and is a great accompaniment for sausages, sauerkraut, dumplings and goulash.
To just sit and session a few? Nah.,"
Pilsner Urquell,3.73,Poured out into a clear glass beer mug. Pours a light golden color with a decent white head. Smells of hops and some kind of a spice. Taste is of light hops. Okay beer and not bad as a thirst quencher.
Pilsner Urquell,2.83,Really gross Pilsner.
Pilsner Urquell,4,"""Best by 8/25/22""; drank 7/14/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through golden appearance.

A rough pour yielded a nice off-white head; decent lace.

Fresh bread, caramel & faint skunk notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, caramel & faint funk flavors.

A bit odd, but flavorful & interesting. I'd have another!"
Pilsner Urquell,3.69,Had it on Prague
Pilsner Urquell,3.08,"A bit disappointed, before trying I read alot of great reviews. Unfortunately it tasted like an average pilsner and also has quite a harsh bitter aftertaste."

Pilsner Urquell,3.83,"This is it, the gold standard your Pilsner should strive for. Crisp, clean and refreshing. There's no faults it the execution, and nowhere to hide any if there were.

There's better Pilsners, but they're not necessarily available. Macro brew doesn't get better than this at least in the style"
Pilsner Urquell,3.64,"The original Pilsner! It’s good to try these to have that good benchmark for future tasting.

Pours a crystal clear, light golden straw colour with a nice effervescent yet tightly packed, three finger head that slowly recedes over 5 minutes leaving a very circular, spotty cap.

Fairly savoury aroma, interestingly enough. A little bit funky and skunky, mild cheese in the savoury department but without being too musty. Clean aromas for the skunkiness. Gentle floral aromas and clean wheat and breads.

A pleasant bitterness punctuates throughout the flavour profile. Taste follows the nose but it’s a lot cleaner and less funky than the nose suggests. Bready, wheaty, clean floral and grassy on the palate. A little bit sweet with the crisp malt flavours balanced by the grassy, floral hop bitterness.

Crisp mouthfeel with medium carbonation, the large bubbles create a tickling, clean sip. Light bodied with a gentle, subtle but bittersweet finish. Dryish finish.

It’s an interesting beer for sure, better than any typical American lager macro. The skunkiness/savoury notes certainly add a unique aspect to this drink. At the price point it’s never a bad option and it’s great on tap. Glad I could revisit this as I begin to drink craft again, always good to go back to the basics/classics so you can remember the benchmarks for each style."
Pilsner Urquell,4.03,"The best Czech pilsner I've had. first time drinking this. Classic nose with the spice, hops, funk and skunk. Taste follows the nose. Very flavorful. Can't believe it's only 4.4%. Extremely well balanced. The perfect session beer."
Pilsner Urquell,4.42,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Fresh Market for $1.78. Poured into a pils glass.

L - Clear goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head, and with lots of bubbles streaming up. Very good lacing.
S - Floral. Biscuit. White bread. Not too much else, but it's nice.
T - Wow! Starts off simple; floral and grassy. Evolves into a more chewy bread note, then into a bitter hop bite. Nice and bittersweet at first, and finishes bitter.
F - Crisp. Clean. Easy-to-drink. Not filling in the slightest.
O - The de-facto pilsner. Well-balanced, complex enough, and rounded. Though it's not the best, it sets the bar for what a pilsner should be! I definitely recommend it, but don't kill yourself looking for it."
Pilsner Urquell,3.5,"It's good! But a bit overrated. It's a nice pilsner which is easy to drink and fairly balanced, the little bit of sweetness weights up the bitterness from the hops in a good way without becoming too sweet. Has a nice carbonation, served here in a 50 cl can.

But it is something out of the ordinary? Nah, not really. It's good, but it's not something you go ""woooow"" over.
Perfect beer though if you want an easy-going ice cold beer to relax with in the summer or together with a bite to eat, imo.

I buy it from time to time, which means I like it enough to come back to it. So I say try it, especially if you like stanard lagers/pilsners. There are a lot of worse lagers out there for sure."
Pilsner Urquell,3.75,"A pilsener as good as pilseners get. Rerate: Had it from can this time, still the benchmark of a good pilsener. Only 4,4% now, but I remember (I think!) that the alcohol content was about 5,2% when I first had it (in Germany) many years ago?!"
Pilsner Urquell,3.39,"Pilsner is not my jam. Strangely I love every other type of lager, but the hop variety and peppery notes of the style don't work for me. Trying to be objective here, but I did not enjoy this one."
Leffe Blonde,4.66,I like it very much. It's a real not-watered-down sissy beer.
Leffe Blonde,4.42,"Highly drinkable and refreshing. Hits with a pleasant yeasty flavor immediately, with a lemony zest. Fairly light body for easy drinking, with gentle sparkling carbonation. No real surprises as you continue to drink, just a pleasant and dependable ale."
Leffe Blonde,3.81,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a goblet. Looks dark golden, almost amber color with a creamy white head that fell to a cap. Some lacing coats the glass as I drink. Smell is spice, clove, cinnamon, banana bread. Taste starts sweet and spicy with banana and clove dominating. Middle sees a bit of candied fruit and then a dose of hops brings some bitterness to the front. Finish is candi sugar and spice. Aftertaste is subdued. Feel is light bodied, prickly carbonation, and a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall, not a style I seek out, but this is a good beer that's interesting to drink."
Leffe Blonde,3.75,"Bought a 6-pacl 11.2oz bottles $11.99 Whole Foods
238 days before best by date

High carbonation

Overall a good beer for the price. Most Belgian beers are $5-$9 for a single bottle so while this is not as good as those, at $2/bottle this is a good deal."
Leffe Blonde,3.76,It’s an ok Belgian blond. I much prefer the Leffe Brun.
Leffe Blonde,4.31,Amber color and with a sweet bitter taste that doesn’t leave a bitter aftertaste.
Leffe Blonde,4.83,"Look: This pours deep yellow and clear with three fingers of head that could easily be more, regular bubbling, very attractive ber.

Aroma: Bread, bananas, sweet, yeast, and a hint of cloves.
Taste: Vanilla, Banana, Caramel, Cloves, and even a hint of cinnamon, extremely smooth ending in a light hoppy bitterness.

Feel: Syrupy and highly carbonated. Will additionally fizz if you swish it around in your mouth. Quite a full mouthfeel.

Overall: An excellent and very high quality Blonde Ale, probably the best beer I've tasted in this class."
Leffe Blonde,4.23,"Look: Pours a light orange shade of brass with a one finger, finely compacted head of white foam. Great lacing and head retention.

Aroma: Bananas foster, bubblegum, slightly spicy notes of clove and vanilla bean.

Taste: Bananas foster in a bottle.

Feel: Full bodied. Full carbonation.

Overall: A phenomenal Belgian blonde ale. Just an overall excellent taste, aroma and mouthfeel. Very pleasant to drink."
Leffe Blonde,4.18,Very good blonde ale. Would be buy again
Leffe Blonde,3.26,"purchased from the neighborhood drug store. Poured over ice fresh from the bottle. Pours a straw golden yellow, smells of malted bananas. Frothy mouth feel, a decent amount of fizz. It reminds me of sitting in the garden all day and talking about the end of world while titrating amphetamine salts and discussing how the government controls the weather. Its a beer you find open but mostly full on the deck the next the next morning while cleaning up and decide to skull it anyway. Is it a good example of the style no, is it a little different and you know what it will be with no surprises, yes."
Leffe Blonde,1.36,"Looks fancy. Costs fancy. Tastes like rotten Budweiser. But costs 4 times as much. 0/10 would not buy again, especially when there are so many vastly superior options."

I get close and spice.malt sweetness.
Good carbonation and clean finish.
I would like this with fondue."
Leffe Blonde,3.7,"Pours a massive, persistent head, leaving ample lace. Cidery carbonation. Clear golden color.
Faint banana aroma. This is no bubblegum bomb. Taste is light banana with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel on the light side.
This is a decent session beer for a Belgian ale with 6.6% ABV."
Leffe Blonde,3.09,A light Belgian ale. Not my favorite
Leffe Blonde,3.39,"11.2oz gold foil topped bottle into big mug while in the town chat

Clear and puffy white head. Smell is sweet cereal malt and clove. Very, overly sweet and slick feeling. This is probably the best thing InBev makes (even if they do this on the sly)

It is just okay for a Belgian ale, but sometime this is all you can find"
Leffe Blonde,3.65,"Appearance: Clear gold, good head.

Smell: Skunk at first, then cloves and phenol-y yeast.

Taste: Bubblegum sweetness throughout with some cloves and phenolic yeast notes in the finish.

Overall: Decided to try this after seeing it a fair amount on the WBAYDN? Thread. I don't usually go for the Belgian pale ales, but this was enjoyable. I liked the bubblegum note and the yeast notes were complementary instead of distracting. Now I'll have to try their brown ale."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.1,"Notes from 2011-12. 12oz bottle into a pint glass.
L: copper, fairly clear. Lite tan head.
S: caramel candy, earthy and fruity.
T: malty, sweet with a fine hop bite that doesn't go too far. Some pine lingers.
F: fairly smooth drinking with a medium heavy mouthfeel. On par with Lagunitas.
O: reminds me of a Christmas ale but not as bitter. Excellent."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.36,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.6%, OG 1085, IBU 66.6. Beautiful amber to copper colour, moderate off-white head. Strong aroma of fruity American hops, old marmalade, caramel and crystal malts, alcohol. The flavour is very sweet, and the alcohol is not well hidden, but soon overpowered by a massive hoppy attack. Warming mouth- and throatfeel.Maybe too much of everything, but still a guilty pleasure to drink."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.93,"The pour from a tap into a plain pint glass brings an amber-brown fluid, closest to 16 on the SRM chart. There's a nice light biege head atop, but attention quickly shifts to the enticing malty hop aroma. There is rich body here, as evidenced by all the pretty glass lacing. The initial taste is good, malty but with some hop contributions. What kills the enjoyment is the cloyingly sweet after taste. If a honey like finish to a beer sounds good, here it is."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4,12 oz bottle pours a deep amber in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong hop aromas of grapefruit and pine. Full bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of pine and grapefruit. More of a strong IPA.
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.91,"This here is the one that turned me onto American Pale Ales.

I think APA is now my favorite beer and it's thanks to Undercover Investigation Shutdown and others like it.

Doesn't look or smell too special but it tastes like a million bucks. For the high abv, you mostly just taste the hops and it is DELISH.

One of my top 5 beers I always look for and enjoy in season.

Great job, Lagunitas!"
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.08,"Appearance: Clear amber color with a modest-sized light beige head that slowly faded. Nice looking beer.

Smell: Pine forward hop aromas with some mild fruit notes.

Taste: Moderate nondescript fruit notes with some moderate pine hop notes. The beer starts off mildly sweet but works its way to a fairly dry final finish.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

Overall: A good easy drinking Strong Ale,"
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.07,"This is a real treat, bought as part of a mix-a-six at Bartonsville Giant. Poured out of 12 oz. bottle into pint glass.

L: Pours a rich cascading copper amber, with a big solid head that slowly recedes, leaving plenty of sticky lacing behind. Hazier than most beers I drink.

Smell: Sweet but rich. I detect rye bread, malt, toasted caramel, and honey. Notes of vanilla and tobacco emerge as it warms. Also a very mild, almost stale fruit note.

Taste: Luscious and luxurious. At first the hops tingle your tongue with bitterness, then you get the sweetness of the caramel and malts. There's something complex and smokey towards the back of the throat, like beef jerky. No burn whatsoever, and no tricks to hide the booze. For a beer of this alcohol content it is remarkably well balanced.

Feel: Very little carbonation. Still, the beer doesn't feel flat or sticky at all. Very smooth and clean, somewhat chewy and thick but not overly heavy.

Overall: Great beer. Most of the time I'm too broke to buy stuff like this but I decided to treat myself tonight. I'm glad I did. This isn't the most refreshing beer but it might just be the most palatable high-ABV offering you can buy."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.09,"A: Pours a one finger head. Deep caramel amber.

S: Sugary piney hops. Molasses, dark citrus, a nice pungency that keeps it grounded. Lemon to balance it out. Alcohol is definitely present

T: Starts off with a bready sweetness, culminating in a spicy grapefruity taste before a mild hop bitterness creeps and fills the mouth. The hop sensation lingers for awhile, creating a slight warming sensation.

O: The alcohol is hidden well. This is a sticky sweet malty beer that's saved by a hop cleanse after every sip"
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,4.15,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter.

Cloudy amber with a thin off-white head.

Nose: pine/floral hops, biscuity toasted malt, and caramelized sugar.

Taste: Caramel malt up front, floral hops, and a nice dose of buttering hops on the finish.

Feel: medium body, medium-low carbonation. Very drinkable."
Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,3.59,"Definitely defies what it is. On tap at Industry Public House with Leah. Hoppy, malty at the same time. Yes, rich. Heavy on caramel. Deep rich Amber color. Nice beer. Strong alcohol."

Bigfoot,3.23,"Pretty bummed on this one. It’s like buying a ticket to see Babe Ruth play, but he was too hungover or in jail or something and not in the starting line up. Right from the start, I detected syrup in the aroma; and then what do you know? Leggo my Eggo - syrup on my palate too.

Well, you win some. You lose some. And right here I’m becoming ambivalent as it warms. Wait…

Yeah, not much. Still a big dollop of syrup in the aroma, but it has died down a bit in taste. Still nothing to call your mama about."
Bigfoot,4.27,"A large beer, like its secretive primate namesake. Much malt, hops and ethanol. Looking forward to vertical tastings with this."
Bigfoot,4.16,"This beer is not meant as a session ale. I buy it once a year as a treat, and this year in 2022 it is exceptional! I get a clean head, with well balanced pine and tropical fruit for the body. The finish is bread flavors and a warming effect; this beer is complex in flavor and feel. I’d recommend this one for connoisseurs."
Bigfoot,4.49,"2016 bottle from the cellar - not going to lie - not sure I drank any of the 2016 fresh....
Pours a clear garnet, dark ruby colour with tawny beige head. A bit of sediment left in bottle.
Aroma of caramel malt, bread, date but despite age a strong hop burst is there - piney, resin, candied grapefruit peel.
Malty sweetness on the palate - burnt toffee, caramel, date and bread - quickly overcome by a barrage of hop flavours - resinous pine, candied citrus peel, grapefruit with a sticky bitterness coating the palate.
Full sticky mouthfeel, decent carbonation despite aged state with a lingering powerful bittersweetness.
Marvellous."
Bigfoot,1.52,"Yes, Bigfoot is an legend, an icon. And, every year, I have one, or two, singles, and yes, last year I depleted the stock at multiple locals, and for 6 months, it was that good. Got my bitterness on, along with Old Rasputin, how I survived (last year) ,... this year? This is not THAT review ...

This year? This beer fucking stinks, on rye, like one reviewer noted, recently, Yes, I finished my one sixer, and just to be sure, wasted the $2.50 on one more single last night ... way too harsh, and plastic, fake, tasting. No balance and this will only got worse over time And while, the other legend Celebration Ale, was very good, it does NOT belong in cans. loses aroma."
Bigfoot,4.28,"2022 bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Brewing Co tulip glass

A: Pours gorgeous ruby copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a firm layer that hangs around for a bit and leaves plenty of nice lacing.

S: Rich toasty bready malt, toffee, dark and stone fruit, all countered with a strong hit of resinous pine and citrus rind.

T: Hops hit first, citrus, grapefruit and orange, resinous pine, followed by a mix of fruity notes, plum, fig, apricot, peach, cherry, and raisin, toasty bready malt, and toffee sweetness.

M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, just a hint of alcohol.

O: Didn't realize I hadn't logged this one until recently, even though I've had plenty of it before, so I figured I might a well grab a fresh bottle and enter in a baseline, then revisit with a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it drinks kinda like a mix of TIPA and hoppy American Strong Ale, in a good way. English Barleywines get the majority of the attention, but there's a reason this American style one has stayed around so long. (4.28)"
Bigfoot,4.57,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4. 2022 vintage. Poured into a cognac snifter.

L - A fantastic clear ruby, with a two-finger khaki head that doesn't die out. Lacing is excellent.
S - Super floral. Getting rosehip, grapefruit peel, pine tar, and red apple. A hint of ethanol on the nose.
T - Toffee, stone fruit, and pine resin. Juicy grapefruit, followed by a heavy black bread note. Finish is intense and pine-heavy. You really pick up the ABV on the latter half of the glass...
F - Full-bodied, with minimal carbonation. Filling. Warm. Heavy.
O - The king of Sierra Nevada's brews. Like the weathered father of an immature imperial IPA. Dense, intense, and titillating every sense, this one is for the fans. Highly recommend, and I'll be getting another bottle to age."

Bigfoot,4.34,"another great bigfoot this year (2022) strong malty , drink slow to get all the flavors"
Bigfoot,4.48,My 2nd foray into a gnarly wine style beer after Lagunitas Brown Shugga. Definitely catch the malts sweetness on the nose but it's the intense malt/hop hit on the 1st sip that is impressive. The booziness definitely becomes apparent as you sip this brew along with the hops as it warms. Overall I love this style and looking forward to cellaring a few of these for a few years.
Bigfoot,4.64,"2022

Grapefruit, floral, and piney hops over a deep caramel malt aroma with hints of dried fruit
Bold pine and grapefruit rind hops, big caramel malt. Long, bitter finish

An American classic for a reason"
Bigfoot,4.22,"2021 version. Poured 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep caramel color with an off white head that falls to a cap. Very active carbonation rising up. Aroma is caramel and earthy hops mixed with a combination of dark fruit and citrus fruit. Taste is caramel, malty sweetness, resinous/earthy hops, and alcohol. Feel is thick and chewy with a nice carbonation bite. In the end there's a bit of dryness that sneaks in. There's a definite alcohol warmth with this. Overall, I don't have a lot of experience with barleywines, but I do like this and would buy again."
Bigfoot,4.77,"I first started drinking Bigfoot exactly 10 years ago, and every year, I buy several 6 packs and drink them periodically throughout the year. Today, I'm drinking the 2022 release on 2/5/22. It is outstanding, as usual. There was a ton of hop residue in the bottom of the bottle already, and I like my Bigfoot on the hoppy side, so I swished the last little bit around in the bottom of the bottle before I finished the pour. Pours a beautiful (and slightly hazy) dark cherry to copper hue with a beige head that falls down to an island with a ring around the rim of the glass. Smell is actually slightly mute this time around, but I can detect a slight caramel sweetness that blends well with a general, but faint, hop presence. The taste is definitely hop-forward, as I did swish the residue out of the bottle into my glass, but for me, that makes it perfectly balanced with its absolutely booming malt character. I believe that several hop varieties are used in the brewing of this beer, and the bitter aftertaste is absolutely there, but the malt flavor is so huge that it's hard to pinpoint any one flavor that stands out; it is amazingly well blended. Bitter-sweet medium-thick mouthfeel that finishes quite dry... the alcohol presence is very well hidden... Overall one of the best Bigfoot releases I've had yet!"
Bigfoot,4.22,"Long-time Bigfoot enthusiast. Generally you can expect a somewhat-sweet, quite malty version of an IPA, like an IPA that has had 40% of the water evaporated out of it. Generally, delicious!

2022's is harsher, as KT3418 has mentioned (although ""barleywine style"" is just a legal term for all barleywines...not an indication that it's not a real barleywine). The usual heat is just not balanced this year by enough syrupy sweetness. Disappointing but it's still one of the more awesome brews on the shelves."
Bigfoot,4.44,"Minimal head on a deep copper body. The aroma doesn't prepare for the taste, which is intense. A wonderfully bitter hop bite on a robust malt base, with a full mouthfeel. This will be great for cellaring!"
Bigfoot,3.91,"I poured a 12 oz. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot into a pint glass. A cream colored head emerged above a beautiful red amber body that was impressively carbonated. Profuse lacing rose above a head that receded but never entirely disappeared. I have never been more impressed by a beers' look! The magic faded on the nose, however. Nice raspberry and bread notes were offset by a pungent hops note, which overrode the more pleasant components. The taste was a bit more amenable to enjoyment... the sweetness expected from a barleywine is there, and lingers a bit, but after a minute without a sip, the hops reasserts and again controls your senses. There is a sense of quality to this brew... the taste, look and feel of it are assertive, and if you are a true hophead, you might be enchanted with Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. I prefer to enjoy a barleywine that celerates its' fruited and grain characteristics. This is not that beer. The mouthfeel is quite good, I anguished a bit, that perhaps it deserved a 4.5. Overall, the taste and smell kill it for me, but I like dark, sweet beers. There are simply too many hops in the mix here for me, but I do believe it is a quality brew that will be cherished by hops lovers."
Bigfoot,3.01,"The 2022 edition is absolutely awful fresh. Tastes like an extremely malt-forward IPA. None of us could stand this. Hope it's better next time or with age. Did not taste like a barleywine, can't help but notice they just say barleywine style. Maybe I need to wait 10 years before opening one."
Bigfoot,4.35,"Opaque amber with orange reflections, the foam is compact and fine ocher in color. Scent of caramel, biscuit, date, citric hops but mainly resinous. Sweet, softly and sweetly malty entry, generously bitter finish on resinous and fresh paths despite two years from bottling. Medium and round body with fine low intensity carbonation. Few elements elegantly linked together. Delight."
Bigfoot,4.6,"Beginning in 2005 I've enjoyed each year of this release. It is perfectly rich, sweet and hoppy with deeply caramelized malts, firm and creamy. It has the signature SN central axis of taste that illuminates throughout their beers. Now 2021, I can finally cellar some bottles to enjoy and age for a few years. A beautiful American Barleywine that is world-class in it's style.
UPDATE as of April 7, 2022:
2021 release 12oz bottle pkg dated 12/10/2020 into a pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly clouded ruby burnished copper w/a thin creamy khaki head that dissipates to creamy edge foam. No visible carbonation. No lacing.
S: Roasted malt, caramelized malts, light earthy hops, a hind of biscuit. Moderate alcohol as the beer warms.
T: Gentle sharp hop bitterness, roasted malts followed by dates, citrus rind, sweet/tart hops, caramelized malts again then deep pine resin that goes fairly broad on the tongue. It's firm & lengthy hop bitterness results in a long resinous linger.
F: Lightly crisp, bold, firm, medium bodied mouth feel w/a drying long lingering finish.
O: This annual American Barleywine release I have is 16 months cellared and has a radiant taste of sweet malts and pine resin hops. It's toastiness & bitterness are expertly blended and it is outstanding and or world-class in it's style.
*The 2022 release has a bit more of a head, the body is clear burnished copper, aroma has berries and is a bit more citrusy, the taste is quite similar though bitterness is at the front rather than in the finish, it's feel is slightly slick. Overall it is fantastic."
Bigfoot,4.41,"12 oz bottles poured into snifters. Side by side tasting of the 2011 and 2014 vintages:
L - both are caramel colored with nice hazelnut heads that lingered. 2011 may be a shade darker, but really no noticeable difference
S - same, very slight scent, caramel and bread
T - caramel, sweet nuttiness. both are very nice, with both malt and hop flavors. 2014 is a bit silkier and more full bodied, 2011 seems to have more hop bitterness
F - thick mouthfeel, 2011 has a tad more carbonation feel to it
O - both are very nice, initially I prefer the 2014 vintage, it's a bit smoother and silkier"
Bigfoot,4.22,"A-beautiful dark caramel color with substantive head and lacing that lasted a long time
S-Moderate roast and hoppy notes
T-With the heavy hops, this almost seems like a boozy, not as roasty Black IPA. Which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Above average bitter for the style.
M-Medium(+) body, a little chewy, pretty dry finish. Moderate carbonation.
O-unexpected, different, really good."
Obsidian Stout,4.34,"I don’t know why it has taken me this many years to try this beer. It’s really darn good. Very much an American Stout with the piney PNW hopping and bitterness levels. SRM, head color and solid retention is practically perfect."
Obsidian Stout,4.06,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour a nice head forms my pour was pretty gentle so it wasn't huge, but it was made up of fine light brown bubbles. It fades to a decent ring with some on top. It's pitch black with no light coming through.

Smell is mostly roast with strong note of dark chocolate on top of a nice dark bread base with some earthy piney hops in the mix as well. It's a very pleasant aroma a bit heavy with some lightly fruity fermentation notes.

Taste follows the nose, but with a big bitter hop bite on the front with the roast malts shining through right after. The hop bitterness lingers as the flavor evolves from the hop flavor to the malt roastiness. The fruity fermentation stick around a bit. In the stout it's like raisins or vague dark cherries but it isn't pronounced. Quite nice and very nuanced.

Feel is quite heavy. One of those liquid bread beers and quite thick in the mouth as more head forms. Despite that it's easy to put down and quite smooth. Goes with a meaty meal or just a nice cold night with a good show.

Overall despite being a standard stout at just above 6% it's got a big flavor without adjuncts. Very good what they did with hops water and malt here. Good job."
Obsidian Stout,4.35,12/31/21 Bottle from Kadota. Espresso dominates with roasted malt & chocolate overtones. Not sweet. Some bitterness & burnt. Prefer less coffee but very good.
Obsidian Stout,4.31,"Appearance: Dark cola color, maybe a bit of brown towards the bottom. Fluffy khaki colored head, spotty lacing.

Smell: Roasted malt, peanut shells, rust.

Taste: Chocolate, ash, grains, burnt toast.

Feel: Medium bodied, well carbonated. Dry.

Overall: I've waited years to try this. I'm happy I did."
Obsidian Stout,4.18,"look: 92% black

smell: toasted bread, light coffee

taste: robust, dense bread, some smoke

feel: medium body, balance, easy crushable, overall finish is towards the bitter end

overall a well rounded high quality stout, not as good as founders breakfast or old rasputin"
Obsidian Stout,4.21,"Almost most black, tan head fades to a ring, leaving a nicely laced glass. Aroma of bitter coffee and roasted malt. Tastes is similar, a nice hoppy finish. Ful bodied, grat carbonation, terrific beer!"
Obsidian Stout,4.38,"Black body with creamy brown head. Completely full body, impossible to see through. So nice looking. Aroma is of coffee and medium dark chocolate, some dark fruits as well along with a dash of earthy hops. Taste is superb, with rich chocolate textures and an espresso bitterness. The earthy hops provide a a nice dry balance. Mouthfeel is slightly milky with a mild chalky feel. This is a terrific example of a stout."
Obsidian Stout,4.08,"I have enjoyed this brew many times before, but never reviewed. Now is the time. A new hop to me, Delta. The malt profile promises rich creamy and sweet.
An impressive mousse caramel head with microbubbles forms straightaway. Appears nitro but is not. The liquid is black black as expected. Not super thick but enough for 6+ abv. Carbonation only seen when shaken.
Nose: Cocao, chocolate chip cookie, deep roasted coffee notes lingering. Dark and indulgent. Hop presences with malt. Cream. Comperable in smell to Old Rasputin.
The espresso notes are certainly there. It leaves the same aftertaste as biting a coffee bean. Excellent for those who enjoy. Pleasantly lighter than I expexted with a slight bite to balance the malt. There is residual booziness but when combined with the bitter espresso it works well.
A sharp stout.

As a coffee lover this works for me. If you dislike, avoid Obsidian. The mouthfeel is lacking in fullness and action, but is made up for in taste and smell. For Deschutes, I think their Porter is a better option (but not fair, as it is one of the best.)"
Obsidian Stout,4.01,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled 2/24/21, had 6/20/21.

Pours a dark brown, opaque, with a quarter inch foamy head and some slick foamy lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, a bit smoky. Flavors of chocolate, herbal hops, roasted malt, vanilla, a bit of a smoky flavor, a little hop bitterness on the finish. Smooth, a very good medium to full body, well carbonated.

A good, solid stout, roasty and smoky. Very enjoyable."
Obsidian Stout,4.23,"pours an almost jet black with dark tan head that lingers a decently long time. Leaves a thin rim of lace at the original liquid level. Smell= taste: some bitterness, some dark chocolate, some roasted malts. Nice for something not barrel-aged. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinnish side for my preferred stout experience. Cost effective, IMO, compared to some of the better, but pricier, stouts. I would drink this again."
Obsidian Stout,4.1,"This is a 12oz. bottle dated 11/19/20 poured aggressively into a 20oz. weizen glass. There is a perfect three finger tan head over a very dark cola stout. This stout is way to dark to observe carbonation, After ten minutes the foam settled back to a thin layer with thick lacing left behind.
The aroma is sweet chocolate up front with light coffee in the background.
The flavor is just the opposite, with chocolate up front, but the taste is dominated by the dry, bitter coffee flavors. There is not a noticeable alcohol burn for me. The coffee flavors cut the sweetness very nicely.
There is a silky smooth feel, but not overly heavy. The carbonation feels light.
For me this stout was very enjoyable, but be ready for bitter coffee flavors."
Obsidian Stout,2.68,"Obsidian is an apt description: dark, opaque, a persistent cappuccino froth for a head. Then I start to get disappointed. The scent is slightly over-hopped citrus and coffee, and the taste only enhances the citrus.... and keeps enhancing it as I drink. Over-carbonated going down, this is not the stout I was looking for."
Obsidian Stout,3.64,Not my favorite stout. Next!
Adios Ghost,4.78,"White gold haze. Nose is ripe pineapple and sticky melon. Taste is bursting ripe tropical fruit. Sticky sun warm pineapple, melon, and mango. Not at all syrupy. Barest rind bitterness on the finish. Slick smooth mouthfeel. No abv hint. Potentially the best Monkish I've ever had."
Adios Ghost,4.64,Can shared no Rustytacos.
Adios Ghost,4.6,"L - Creamy, hazy yellow with an of white head that sticks around leaving a nice cap as well as some lacing behind.
S - Nice pineapple, mango, citrus, and other tropical fruit notes along with some piney, bitter hops
T - Follows the nose with pineapple, mango, citrus, and other tropical fruit notes along with piney, bitter, dank hops. Some malt to tie things in. There's some milky sugary sweetness on the back end as well.
F - Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, creamy.
O - Honestly, one of the best, straight forward triple NEIPAs I've had."
Adios Ghost,4.7,"Really hazy, murky yellow color with off-white head. Looks like pineapple juice. Aroma has dank hops and lots of fruit juice. Taste follows really juicy and hoppy, yet somehow mild on the palate. No booze at all, drinks like a regular IPA. Nice milky yeast character. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Probably the best triple IPA I ever had."
Adios Ghost,4.99,"I am not even sure where to start or what to say. Monkish is on another level than most, and this is the best I have had from them. Juicy but not too sweet, just enough heat, and cleansing bitterness."
Adios Ghost,4.93,One of the best beers so far I had from Monkish. Nice citrus smell to it and murky Yellow color; with the first taste not hoppy taste but a sweet juicy taste for a triple. Not over powering of taste at all just a perfect balance to it! Very creamy texture to it; this is definitely a perfect brew!
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.31,"Closing out the last days of winter with this tasty coffee stout. Hits on all points, nice cold brew coffee influence, delicious taste and smell, and abv well hidden. Killer deal at $10 for 6."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.33,"12oz can

Clear cola color, the scent is boozy and distant, lots of coffee bean. Taste is so good, I'm not even a huge fan of these coffee stouts, but this is just done damn well.

Pretty delicious for $10 a six pack"
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.24,"Brewhouse Coffee Stout pours an almost black color, with not much head. Aroma is fresh cold press coffee. Flavor is a nice rich sweet malty stout, with fresh cold press coffee flavors mixed in. Good body and feel. Overall, very good coffee stout, flavors blend great."

Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4,"12oz, canned on 01/09/20. Dark brown pour with a foamy tan head. Aroma is dark cocoa, coffee, and roast. A nice amount of coffee complements the roasted barley, dark chocolate, and earthy hop flavors. Medium body, moderate carbonation, excellently balanced. Really good beer here."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.14,"Near black color. No light passes. Lasting small beige head. Some thick streaks.

Bitter black patent malt upfront to the nose. There's a strong aroma of coffee. No notable sugar nor cream.

Smooth body with a nitro-like carbonation. The flavor is mostly coffee but there's a good dollop of Baker's chocolate in the mix. Not quite as dry as most stouts. Long, deep roast malt aftertaste."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,3.41,"Look is black with tannish head. Fairly prominent lacing. Aroma light on coffee and taste followed which is somewhat disappointing for me. Chocolate taste came through more. Bitter aftertaste, but not too dominant. Canned in Oct of 2019. Not bad, but not my favorite stout."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.5,01/23/19 can @home;
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.31,"Poured from a can into a tulip.

Pours an opaque brownish-black (blackish-brown?) with a excellent three-fingered, big-bubbled, foamy tan head that lingers decently and gives way to an excellent ring of lacing.

The aroma is a remarkably balanced blend of roasted grains, caramel malt, and coffee in the foreground, with hints of vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, dark chocolate, smoke/char, cashew, and dark fruit. A tasty aroma.

The flavor is excellent, but a bit of a letdown after the smells. Caramel and brown-sugar sweetness hits hard, but is quickly offset by roasted malts, and coffee--lots and lots of excellent cold-brewed coffee flavor. A variety of chocolate flavors--milk, dark, semi-sweet, cake batter. A shade of booze warming the background.

The brew is certainly full-bodied, yet it never feels heavy or sticky. The carbonation is superb, and it has a drying, instead of a sweet or sticky finish.

This is one of the best coffee-forwards I've had. The coffee is very strong and present, yet it never overpowers the other things that are going on."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,3.73,"Canned on 10/24/19. 12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; small khaki head that fades leaving nice retention and lacing. The aromas have a balanced amount of coffee. Subtle hints of vanilla and chocolate. Malts are there. The flavors follow the nose. The coffee shines and is the star without completely dominating. More hints of vanilla and chocolate. Some roasted characteristics. Low sweetness. Moderate bitterness. Malts do their thing. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with moderate to active carbonation. It's sharp, fluffy, smooth and easy to drink.

This is a pretty solid coffee stout. Nice coffee flavors. Well done. I like it."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.19,"From the growler via Jungle Jim's Eastgate in a snifter.
This nice brew pours a dark blackish brown with a thin
cola highlight and a nice head of khaki foam that settles
to a thin ring, thin dusty layer, and sports some rather
nice lacing. Nose of coffee, light char, and dark sweet
malts. Flavors nail it with dark coffee with moderate
bitterness, touches of dark cocoa, and a thin touch of
cream amongst and smearing of dark fruit jam of
blackberry and raspberry. Nice mouth feel; medium full
body, medium light carbonation, and a rich coffee and
dark cocoa bitter malt finish.

Overall, a SOLID brew from a new to me brewery!

NICE!

Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.21,"There are a few things that keep me here in Lancaster, PA. Two are my mother & the family home + her brother (my maternal uncle) & their family home. Another is our proximity to the major northeastern metropolitan areas & our (relatively) easy access to them, especially by/on public trans. The big one, though, is our insane distro! Goddam, we are the ONLY state outside of Wisco (my love) to get Central Waters! I met their owner/brewer many years ago during PHL Beer Week & it is only because of some connection of his that we see them at all. Obviously, we do not get everything, but I will take one of anything that we do get. This bomber was from The Beer & Beverage Shoppe on Roseville Road & those guys could not be more accommodating! In this case, I merely needed to pluck a bomber from the shelf.

From the Bottle: ""Made with Fair Trade coffee specially roasted for us by www.EmyJs.com Ice Cream*Smoothies*Coffee*Tea"".

I Pop!ped the cap & sat in rapt fascination & contemplation for a moment or two before moving on. When was the last time that I indulged in a bomber? How to handle one? What if it does not bond with me & wants to go home to its fermenter? Eh. I snapped out of it & went with a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the now anxious glass. Ooh, my, did it foam forth! Am I having Stout or cappuccino? The former. It created two fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-tan/light-brown head with very good retention, but without much in the way of lacing. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-quality clarity & ruby highlights. Nose was definitely of coffee, but not in an intense, overwhelming way. Instead, it was more towards a light roast, the kind of thing that I blend with the dark roasts to achieve a more mellow blend, Mouthfeel was big, soft & creamy. Wow! It was like having a well-endowed gal unleash the assets, except in the mouth & on the tongue. Hello. The taste was much like the nose - definitely of coffee, but in a lighter, mellower roasty way than so many of its contemporaries. It was not as rich or robust as my morning coffee, but that was fine. Mine uses several scoops of grounds & has to be coaxed into dripping through the filter. This was a much lighter, less roasty blend that was actually counterintuitively mellow. A mellow Coffee Stout?!? Holy sacrilege, Batman! But wait, Robin! It was a relatively big beer in a bomber (22-fl oz) format. Would you want intensity in quantity? Not me! This was like that mid-afternoon cuppa coffee that I often crave but do not have out of fear of lack of control. All I need is one of my coffees mid-day & I will be orbiting the Earth until well after Midnight. Ugh. This was just so pleasant as I drank it that I almost began to think that it may have been tea-infused. No, this was definitely coffee, but fatigue was setting in. It finished with a pleasant dryness that made me want an amuse-bouche or a small cake-like snack as an accompaniment. Perhaps a Tastykake of some stripe … YMMV."
Brewhouse Coffee Stout,4.16,"Poured from 22oz bottle into glass. No bottling date information found but this has been in my refrigerator for awhile.
Dark brown colored body, with medium brown back lit highlights. One finger of light tan head, which settles back to an interrupted cap and ring. Some minor lacing but most slides back down into body.
Aroma of roasted malts and coffee.
Taste express a lot of the coffee flavor along with the roasted malts.
Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
I have enjoyed this beer over several years for its coffee flavor, and this pour exemplifies this. Rather straightforward, but done well."

Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.84,"Extremely well executed beer. Fantastic mouthfeel with a fantastic balance of the peanut butter, marshmallow and barrel. This beer really stood out in a night full of big bottles."
Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.6,"Pours pitch black, thin tan ring present on the outside of glass. Nose is rig milk chocolate and huge pB. Getting a little bit of woody oak and bourbon coming through. Taste follows the nose, get milk chocolate up front and then big pB. Roasty vanilla notes. A little burn from the barrel, but not a huge barrel presence. Creamy luxurious mouthfeel. Overall delicious. Don’t suspect these are aged long however as the barrel doesn’t play big here. Still a great offering from AC."
Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,4.81,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into an AC pint glass.

Pours a thick oily black body with a dark brown head that sticks around for a while and leaves spotty lacing.

Holy crap this smells unreal. Straight peanut butter chocolate fudge cookies straight out of the oven with extra vanilla extract in them and a touch of coffee. Marshmallow s’mores ice cream galore. Bourbon booziness in the background. Pastry city.

Taste is liquid Reese’s cups with dark chocolate fudge drizzled over them. Vanilla bourbon on the follow through, roasty coffee char on the finish. Thick rich body.

I am a sucker for a good pastry stout, and peanut butter cups. And this is the epitome of both."
Traquair Jacobite,3.92,"Bottle from Altopalato, served at home in a dimpled mug. Brown rddisih colur, small head with no retention and no lacing.
Aroma of dried fruits, dates, raisins, toffee, roasted malts, vanilla.
Medium to full body, creamy texture, flat carbonation, sweet finish.
Taste follows the aroma.
Very good."
Traquair Jacobite,4.25,"""Best before January 31""...not sure if this mean January 2031? Or January 31st on an unnamed year; drank 2/23/22 @ the Yarchives.

Semi-opaque brown orange appearance.

An even pour yielded a small, noisy khaki head; decent lace.

Sarsaparilla, black licorice & mild coriander notes in the nose.

Creamy medium mouthfeel.

Coriander, blackberry & cream flavors.

Interesting, tasty but pretty challenging overall. Definitely worth trying!"
Traquair Jacobite,4.4,"Been a damn minute since I have had this beer, maybe a decade to be honest. One of those beers I tried in the very beginning of getting into craft beer. Excited to see what I think with some experience now.

A- Very dark brown cola body when poured from the stubby 500ml bottle into a becher glass. A nice foamy cap up to a finger with a very light tan off white hue. Small sheets of thin lacing.

S- Rich and sweet dark, dried fruits are bright and intense with raisin, prune and especially plum coming to mind. Definitely picking up a touch of herbal coriander as well as a hint of orange peel. Molasses, brown sugar, toffee, nuttiness, pear, caramel, berry jam and a hint of smoke.

T- Just ground up some coriander the other day and it is not exactly strong but certainly a featured, prominent flavor atop the rich dark grains and the dried dark fruits from the ferment. The malt profile is diverse with toasty, nutty, bready, grainy, slight cocoa, light roast, caramel, molasses and a touch of smoky notes. Plums are bright and are joined by notes of raisin and prune. Pear comes to mind again.

MF- Medium bodied overall with a foamy and slightly creamy texture. The carbonation is at a moderate level and it has a smooth, soft feel to it. Ends with a spice bitterness lingering.

Coriander, a ton of dark bright fruits and a great malt profile. Brings me back a long ways and still a classic that really is quite unique."
Traquair Jacobite,4.1,"Poured this beer from a bottle purchased at a Dallas bottle shop into a tulip glass. Dark brown color with a reddish hue. Initially a beige head and some lacing. Caramel and oak smell and taste. Pleasant warming beer, but expected it to be a bit meatier. A nice beer and I bet it is better fresh on tap."
Traquair Jacobite,4.12,"Review 1514

I had no idea that I did not review this beer. I have drunk this beer several years ago do not remember much about it. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a light tan one-finger head. The head is creamy and foamy with excellent retention. The slow dissipation on the glass left a lot of lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 24, dark brown with ruby red hues. This beer is opaque. Overall this beer is above average for this style.

The aromas in the beer are caramel, roasted malts, toffee, malty sweetness, subtle peat, a touch of smoke, a smidge of Maillard, floral, oranges, and some earthiness.

The flavors in the beer start with a light caramel then segway into peat with oranges and earthiness. Next, I taste some Maillard, floral, toffee dried raisins, molasses, and herbal.

The mouthfeel is coating and warming.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and a medium-plus finish.

At times I felt the malts thin out. It is a malty beer with expressive flavors. It is a solid Scotch Ale. I wanted a beefier malt profile to make it heavier."

Served in a nonic pint glass
Best before June 2019

This beer pours a deep mahogany hue. Faint garnet highlights are visible when held to a light. It doesn't get much head. I get a little aggressive with the second half of the bottle to get anything. It looks flat.

The smell is all malt. I get date and fig. I smell molasses. I get some caramel and toffee.

The caramel, molasses, and toffee are up front in the taste. I get hints of smoke. The caramel and toffee persist throughout the tasting. The fig and dates that I smelled are pretty subtle in the taste.

Medium bodied with an uncarbonated mouthfeel

I got this off the 1/2 off shelf at my local bottle shop. This is a great beer that is past its prime. The smell and flavor are great. The loss of carbonation is the only ill effect of its age."
Traquair Jacobite,4.19,"A: Pours a clear though nearly opaque very dark mahogany in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising slowly along the edges of the glass and moderate chestnut brown + cola brown + garnet red colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall sudsy foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a large patch of thin film covering a little more than 80% of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of caramel + molasses + toasted + nutty + very slightly smoked malts with moderate amounts of dark fruit (plum + prune) + brown sugar + molasses sweetness. Light aromas of herbal hops and a light aroma of spice/coriander. Hints of toasted oak.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of caramel + molasses + toasted + nutty + very slightly smoked malts with moderate amounts of dark fruit (plum + prune) + brown sugar + molasses sweetness. That is followed by light flavors of spice/coriander and a light to moderate flavor from toasted oak. Finally there are light flavors of herbal hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which does not linger for too long leaving behind a light malty sweetness.

M: Medium bodied with slightly lighter than moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly thin/watery for the style.

O: Drinks pretty easily considering the strength and the alcohol is well hidden. Lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas of this beer and it is very enjoyable."
Traquair Jacobite,3.63,"Pours a dark brown with a white-ish head that dissipated quickly. Lots of carbonation.

Tastes of sweet toasted malt with a slight barrel influence and I picked up a general mustiness - not in a bad way. Has a thin body and mouthfeel. Was hoping for more, but it just wasn't there."
Traquair Jacobite,3.92,"Unusual and enjoyable beer, aroma is malty sweet with a touch of coriander. Taste follows with the bite from the coriander much more prominent and the malt flavor slightly subdued compared to my expectations. Caramel malt and a vague spiciness that may be a result of the yeast? Makes for a complex and unusual sipper for me.
Body is much thinner and lighter than anticipated but its a pleasant surprise in my book.
Wonderfully odd.beer, I can imagine that this is someone's absolute favorite and will revisit it as a pairing to a specific meal, maybe south east asian"
Traquair Jacobite,3.8,"Well-aged 330ml bottle served in a tulip (or is it a thistle?). Beer pours cola brown and shows signs of sediment remaining in the bottle. Funky, oak aromas suggest a strong and Belgian styled ale. Flavor has a distinct spiciness accompanying a malty brew. Surprisingly, the flavor is pretty much completely devoid of any roastiness. At least in this bottle the mouthfeel is almost completely still, which for me works well to let the flavors stand on their own. Although that flavor is spice, to my palate I don't place it as coriander. Comparison to doppelbock are apt. Bready and full of molasses and raisins. Brown bread. Really unique."
Traquair Jacobite,4.08,"500mL bottle stamped BBE SEP 2029 poured into a thistle glass at just above fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours bright medium brown in color with mahogany highlights and tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Minimal lacing. The aroma is mild in strength featuring rich malt, subtle earthiness, dark fruit and a bright note of coriander. The taste follows with the coriander up front before the rich (toasted, but not peaty) malt and oak begin to assert themselves. Lots of prune, raisin, leather in the taste as well. Minimal bitterness, but never sweet. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry (spiced) finish. No hint of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, good. I'm not a big coriander fan, but it works in some Belgians. It's extremely well used & offers a subtle balance here, but to my tastes it's out of place."
Traquair Jacobite,4.66,Much much less heavy and a far better mouthfeel experience than that which I have had with other Scotch ales. You can really detect the oak barrel aging process
Traquair Jacobite,4.21,"I love Scotch ales, so I'm excited for this one. Pours a nice dark brown with quickly dissipating head. Nose is coriander, wood, maple, toffee, dirt, and malts. Taste is really interesting. Black licorice, toffee, figs, raisins, and earth. Some wheat on the aftertaste, along with some coffee grounds. This is super complex. Not overly sweet and not really bitter. Nicely balanced with a moderately thick mouthfeel."
Traquair Jacobite,4.21,"Pours dark and opaque with light frothy head. Wonderfully warming on the palate. Toffee, raisin and plum with a woody, slightly smoky finish. Just oozes history"
Traquair Jacobite,4.39,"Aroma is dark fruits, plums, raisins, with the aroma promising sweet malts.

Appearance is a dark black-brown from the front, and a clear dark ruby with a back light. Topped with a 1/2 inch tan head with large bubbles, which fades quickly to a cap with a bubbly center island and a ring. Over time becoming just the ring. Then nothing. Sheets and strings of lacing as you drink that slip a down the side of the glass into the ring.

Taste reflects the aroma: plums, raisins, a bit earthy, sweet caramel. A subdued bitterness is present in the middle, but has faded completely by the finish. The coriander is subtly present, as is the oak. The flavors play off of each other in a wonderful way, with the plums and caramel remaining on the tongue in the aftertaste. You notice the alcohol warmth, but only just. The finish is sweetish, but not overly so.

Feel is mellow and smooth, with a moderate to thick body.

Overall, a delicious Scotch Ale, with a superb complexity of flavors and very well balanced."

The Rusty Nail,4.75,"Pours a dark color with a slight dark tan head and lacing
Aroma has licorice and Bourbon hints
The taste follows the nose with a pleasant licorice and Bourbon flavor
A medium bodied well carbonated smooth beer
A great Bourbon Stout"
The Rusty Nail,4.7,"2022 batch, 13.6% ABV.

Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off.

The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through.

While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise.

It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently.

I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!"
The Rusty Nail,4.59,"Look: like an imp stout should. Deep and dark. Some slight ruby/cola highlights around the edges when held to light. Modest mocha head on the pour that mostly recedes. Some oily, messy lacing that doesn’t stick around long.
Smell: cinnamon up front on a bed of roasty, bourbon, dark chocolate.
Taste: cinnamon and chocolate sweetness up front, countered by a nice roasty, slightly bitter char in the finish."
The Rusty Nail,4.56,"Sampling this 2021 vintage 22 oz bottle poured into my trusty snifter. Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you!
The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.
the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.
The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.

First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.
Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.
So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.
The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.
Very good brew!"
The Rusty Nail,4.74,"Pour as black as black can be and the light brown head was sparse, short and faded quickly.
The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.
Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise. So I'm testing the bottle sealer that so many have recommended.
The feel was pretty typical BA stout, as the bottle was from 2019 it may have lost a bit of it's carbonation but that didn't spoil anything for me."

O - Top notch bba oatmeal stout."
The Rusty Nail,4.52,"i think i expected this to be mind blowing given my love in skinnamon. maybe i wanted more sweetness due to the molasses. anyway, i thought this would be 101% up my alley, and, while it way, it didnt quite live up to my exorbitant expectations. the beer was extremely drinkable. i really enjoyed it, but, alas, i found myself wanting it to be better. im definitely not poopoo-ing it as it was goddam delicious. ill ramble more tomorrow. maybe."

The Rusty Nail,4.54,"2020 vintage

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about

Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw

The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet

This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardless"
The Rusty Nail,4.59,"2020 release, enjoyed mid-February 2022. This is a very serious beer. Wow. Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff."
The Rusty Nail,4.48,"2021 Limited Release. Found quite a few of these Fremont gems at Albany, Oregon Winco. Poured from a wax sealed 20 oz into a 16oz glass.

Look: poured nearly black with almost no head.

Smell: notes of licorice and dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee.

Taste: one of the most intense and smoothest aged oatmeal stouts that I have ever had. No “cough syrup” sting, but notes of licorice, chocolate, and cherry. Nice finish, very smooth.

Feel: smooth and bold.

I am a huge fan of Fremont, so there is some bias. In winters past, my wife loved barrel aged imperial stouts, so this type of “beer” is familiar. This is intense. I’m half way through the bottle (by myself) for dinner and it continues to be an enjoyable sipping beer that will have me in good spirits for the rest of the night. I’m interested in the other bottles of limited release after enjoying this."
The Rusty Nail,4.58,"2020 vintage. Received from @snaotheus in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a snifter at 63°. It pours an oily black with a half finger of creamy, medium-mocha head and thin coating of lacing. Very pretty. Its smell offers roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, pepper, earthy char, and a strong bourbon aroma. The taste is sublime! Like a dessert. It features dark chocolate, oatmeal, cinnamon, burnt coffee, anise, and a strong dose of bourbon. The flavors are distinct but blend magnificently. The result is delicious. The mouth feel is terrific: thick and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and the 13.3% ABV is warming but not distracting. Overall, The Rusty Nail is a magnificent Oatmeal Stout; the best example of the style I've had. It excels in all categories. I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy it."
The Rusty Nail,4.5,"Pours a viscous, oily, pitch black with a finger of mocha head quickly receding to a decent ring and leaving plenty of residual lacing. Aroma is oak, vanilla, cinnamon, burnt sugar, and chocolate. Taste is barrel on the front followed by cinnamon, sweet vanilla and sugar elements. Feel is velvety smooth, perfect carb, very full and enjoyable. Delicious beer, my highest rated for quite some time.

T- Opens with bold oaky bourbon barrel with notes of barrel juice and peppery wet oak, immediately followed by a equal parts cinnamon.

The Rusty Nail,4.13,"The Rusty Nail (2021 Release) from Freemont. Received a 22 oz bomber in a LIF from @snaotheus. Stored at home at 38 degrees. Reviewed 24/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Served at 56.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.4 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Black (SRM 40), opaque.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, same, although some light does penetrate the edge and appears red.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density, fizzy, quickly diminishing to a one to four mm bubble ring and no cap. Second pour produces a 0.9 cm head.
Lacing – None, hardly unexpected at 12.3% ABV.
Aroma – 3.75 – Initially weak licorice, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no cinnamon, faint bourbon as it warms, no oak.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins with the sweet taste of licorice and dates, no hops, no malt, no yeast. No cinnamon. Weak bourbon on the exhale with no oakiness. No ethanol (12.3 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Moderate gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy approaching syrupy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 This is one of those rare brews that looks the same in the glass as it does during the pour. It has a bit of the candi sugar feel of a Belgian brew, a bit sweet. The oats serve well, adding a luscious velvety feel across the palates. Unfortunately for my taste buds, the cinnamon is deeply buried and I’m not sure if I’m actually tasting it or only hoping that I am. As the temperature approaches 61 degrees, the alcohol begins to predominate, so it’s time to chug the remainder. Overall, a decent brew but one that is temperature (and possibly age) dependent."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.3,Apparently I was so faded I forgot to review or even rate this somehow. Super late for any kind of real review but I really liked this one. Idk if I was a hater towards the OG or of I liked this one that much more but I probably need to revist the OG. I do distinctly remember this being fire though
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.28,"Poured black and viscous - topped with an impressive (considering the ABV) brown head that reached a good 2 inches over the liquid. The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished.
The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon. Hmm, smells pretty good.
Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean. Interesting!
The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping.
OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts.
Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better. I have to have them side by side to verify."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.35,"Pours out like used motor oil; pitch black, capped with a creamy light brown head. Great retention and lacing that belies its abv. Like chocolate syrup with a toasted marshmallow on top.

I'm not picking up much aroma this time. Maybe it's too cold? I get molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon for sure, though.

The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke. Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness.

The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy. Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy.

This is a wonderful BBA stout. Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.21,"As an erstwhile Colorado native I proclaim this to be an excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. Personally I like the regular Ten Fiddy better, which I admit is strange. But that said, Oskar Blues did a fantastic job finding the right blend of bourbon barrels to impart a variety of interesting, well balanced nuances to the base stout. The oak and vanilla from the barrels are prominent but not overwhelming. There is a nice, burnt, candied sugar flavor, then the undertones of espresso and chocolate malts. Really quite fantastic overall."
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.71,"Poured black with a dark tan head that hung around for a while.

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.52,"Appearance: Black as you can get. Brown colored head that quickly settled into a thin ring.

Smell: Vanilla, brown sugar, match light charcoal, dates, dark chocolate, sweet booze. Maybe some coffee too.

Taste: Raisins, brown sugar, coffee, a little bit of wood, good amount of bitterness. Vanilla peaks through here and there.

Feel: Full bodied, not a whole lot of carbonation. Oily. Alcohol warmth is gentle.

Overall: A nice stout. Nothing fancy."

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.42,"A great barrel aged imperial stout. It has smooth and thick feel, but the fizzy carbonation may be a little much. The taste holds strong and lingers awhile.

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,5,Massive terps. Will be buying the remaining ones from my local liquor store
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.23,"Light rain while out in The 'Zebo on a pleasant Saturday eve.... going to jump into two 12oz cans.... Both canned 18NOV20....

The brew has been duly snifterized.... It's an oily, opaque black, with an attractive, rocky, dark mocha head. Lacing is solid all around the glass. Bourbon notes are the first things to hit the olfactories.... also present is Bosco-like choco, caramel and molasses, plus bourbon in the background. Mmmm... It's fairly smooth, though a bit less hefty in the body category, imo. I like my stouts full and chewy.

Taste mimics the aroma, with rich choco, vanilla, caramel/toffee, molasses, and hints of raisins and prunes. Again, lurking in the shadows is a pleasant layer of bourbon. A very nice brew, all around. Cheers!!

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.48,"This one was a jet black color with a fluffy brown head. The aroma was chocolate with toffee and bourbon. The taste had chocolate with some caramel, oak, and then a nice bourbon flavor. Nice creamy mouth feel. Very nice."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,3.97,"Very dark, like looking into a dark-glass bottle of red wine. Head dissipates quickly but leaves lots of long-lasting lacing. On the nose, immediate smell of ketchup and then sherry vinegar, hints of toast, levels out into some metallic scents and aromas reminiscent of tannic red wine. Flavor seems less complex, red wine aromas are not reflected much here. Tart and sour, again very much like sherry vinegar. Though flavor is very strong it is light in the mouth. Sourness leaves a little tingle as you breath out through the nose. Sweetness and metallic notes present well into the finish. Carbonation seems lower (which I like). Good experience but not to be drank regularly."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.07,"750ml bottle into a tulip. Couldn't find any dating.

Looks magnificent in the glass. Deep dark ruby red body, crystal clear when held up to the light. Off white head is replenished by carbonation and leaves layers of lacing.

Aroma is a little musty.

On tasting, it's quite well balanced, slightly more to the sweet side. Goes down very easy. Notes of dark berry fruit, red wine.

Mouth medium, finish fruity and a little drying.

Overall, an enjoyable drink. Tart, sweetness, and sour all seem to blend into each other, each occasionally rising to the top before falling away."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.39,"Wowzer! Sweet, Oakley sweet, and very yummy .... Always love finding a new surprise that's great"
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.91,"Only notable note to form a complain is vinegary after taste, but even that is balanced and elevated with sour and sweetness, and salt. This beer must be a fluke, no one can do this well if they try."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.18,"Dark reddish-brown body, clear; excellent carbonation; moderate sized, lasting head; dense and spongy. Pleasing aroma of cherry with a mild, general sourness. Outstanding taste; initial lightly sweet malt flavor; caramel; sour cherries. Heavy body; soft and spongy; light acidity.

I have been holding on to this one for a while. Despite being a few months past its suggested best before date, the beer drinks surprisingly easily. The blending of sweetness and sourness is superb, while the mildly toasted malt adds an excellent level of depth and complexity.

Pouring temperature: 56 °F; bottling data: Best before 2021-11-26"
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.04,"Poured semi vigorous, was late getting phone and head had dissipated to what you see now. It is actually pretty appealing though, a nice dark brown/red hued color with a creamy ring around the glass. Some floaties hanging out too.

Smell is interesting and very unique...I keep getting all sorts of different smells each time. First it was all acetic, the came some tart cherry, then I got a weird funky note that almost reminded me of cheese, yes its definitely there, but it only shows itself every now and then; last note grape skin. At this point I'm very curious what this one tastes like...

Wow, that is certainly not what the nose told me it would be. Sure the sour and acetic are there but it is actually a lot sweeter than I would've ever expected. It is almost like cherry candy at first that quickly goes tart, reminds me of sour patch kids in reverse. There is also some baking spice notes that were no where to be found on the nose. I didn't pick up on oak initially but it does show itself in the aftertaste fo rme.

Mouthfeel is medium, typical belgian carbonations, a beautiful combination of both sweet and mouth puckering sour; they mingle on the tongue in perfect balance.

Trying Belgian beers like this is always a treat for me. I don't drink them often but every time I do it seems I find myself being taken on a sensory trip all over the place. So many different aromas, then tastes and all always balanced in such a perfect way."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,"Pours a deep dark amber-cherry colour, the light carbonation at first might fool you as it grows into a two inch bubbly head, that collapses into a persisting one inch, soft fluffy head that lasts well over ten minutes. The lacing is off the charts on my tulip glass

While many beers have that citrus zest smell on the nose, Duchesse has much more of a juicy smell instead. Dark cherries and malt are strongest here, Oak-y wine like must smells swirl around as well.

Those wine like notes are up front for sure, the sourness is a light, tart cherry, and general fruitish notes (green apple, blackberries, oh, and wine grapes of course with that sourish thick skinned vinous chew). Nice subtle long finish, the malt backbone lasts the longest, and the gentle sourness finishes very sweet.

Disagree with the review(s) that said it was one dimensional. This absolutely opens up, not just as the beer warms, but on the sip as well. The Oaky, wine, grape must notes are strong at first with the sweet sourness before opening up with some dark cherry notes. Mouth watering at this stage. And yet, it finishes dry and you get the real malty sweetness, notes of apple, blackberries, maybe raspberries but I’d at least say general juicy tart fruits.

Soft carbonation that creates a gentle sip that goes down easy, but enough lasting carbonation to support a head that collapses into a thick fluffy one inch line that lasts almost the entire duration of the drink. Gentle sour notes pucker the tongue slightly before opening up.

I haven’t had many Flanders red ales or lambics, krieks, etc in a long time so I can’t say this is a benchmark, but it certainly feels like it. Overall the looks, tastes, smells of this beer are gorgeous and it’s not overwhelming on any one area to scare anyone off. If you want a beer that goes hard in any direction I’m sure you could find it, but Duchesse de Bourgogne has the balance and yet complexity to absolutely satisfy, a gorgeous well priced sour"
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.3,"On tap at Whole Foods.

A - Pours a vibrant cherry color with no lacing and no carbonation. Not much life in this glass but maybe the CO2 on the tap line isn't set correctly?

S - Really nice, tart cherry, black cherry aroma with a slight bit of juiciness on the nose and a delicate amount of sour twang.

T - Cherry from start to finish with a puckering, tart sweetness on the back side.

M - Slight puckering big body that's silky soft and leaves the mouth watering.

O - This is a really fantastic beer and highly recommended for the style."
Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.33,"L-A real pretty reddish brown pour. Approximately 2 fingers worth of a light amber head. A real nice color combination.
S-Nice fruity smell with a hint of oak. The malt and hops also come through.

F-Real smooth
O-When I first took a sip of this beer I was totally surprised because I never tasted any beer quite like this. But the more I drank it the more it grew on me. This is a very unique and well blended beer. When you’re in the mood to try something different I recommend giving this beer a try.

Duchesse De Bourgogne,4.96,"Purchased as a 28-ounce tall bottle at The Fresh Market for $14.90. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Ruby/mahogany with a one-finger dark eggshell head. Incredibly beautiful lacing; coats the sides of the glass.
S - Merlot grapes, leather, and cherry. Oak. Legitimately smells of a good red wine.
T - Cherry, dates, and grape on the front. Oak and tannin notes throughout, with a charred oak base. Finish is tart and juicy, and left on a slightly bitter berry note. On the sweeter side at first, it turns well-balanced as you progress down the glass.
F - Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Silky and juicy. Satisfying finish.
O - Though my ratings may differ, this is my new favorite beer. Wine-like sans the snobby, this is a perfect pairing to my Thanksgiving meal. If I were to have one beer before I died, I'd be honored for this to be the one. I cannot recommend this enough. Will purchase again."

T: Tart, sour, sharp acrid sweetness, full flavored dark fruits, oak wood cask, cranberry, cherries. It is fairly intense tasting and I do taste nuances of malt in the background towards the finish.
F: Medium-light bodied, lively with carbonation, acidic and moderately drying. It has an intense and compact mouthfeel that is puckering.

S: Aroma is tons of sweetness up front, moderate dark fruits, huge butterscotch, a bit caramely. Tartness is mild, but there is pretty prominent pungent cheese like funky notes. 4

T: Taste is just bursting with flavor, huge rich dark fruits, equally huge sweetness with tons of sugary caramel notes. There is tartness, but it’s not particularly prominent. No reply
funky notes at all. It does provide some balance but for the most part it’s a sweetness bomb which admittedly I find a bit surprising. I do get some oaky notes to round it out. Very good but almost too one dimensional which again I am shocked by. 4.25

M/D: Full bodied but not heavy, carbonation perfect, some mild puckering tartness made it more drinkable than it otherwise would be. 4.25

Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.35,"2022-07-16
750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. Bottling date 08/26/2020. Bought it earlier today at Chuck's Hop Shop Seward Park. It was expensive.

Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.

Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry. Overall, this is a very good beer."
Schaarbeekse Kriek,4.3,"750ml brown bottle, caged and corked. Label has bottling date of '08/26/2020', with best before date of '10/26/2040'.

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years.""

Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing.
Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe.
Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach.
Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
Very good fruited lambic, although could likely increase more complexity and funk expression with bottle aging."

T: Citrus up front, followed by peach and strawberry. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with some dankness. Very little heat for the ABV.

""Long days and pleasant nights"" on the date code

Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

Very Hazy,4.1,With my good friends Mark & Marcia.
Very Hazy,4.17,"really cool to get to drink this, so thankful i have people in my life who want to share this kind of thing with me, but i am just shocked that this comes in at number 15 on the BA top beers list, like in the entire world, seems outlandish for something i would not even describe as insanely well refined or anything, and yeah the hop profile is great, but it also has some burn, some unneeded weight, feels under carbonated to me, and really doesnt distinguish itself as elite in any way. that might sound harsh, if this was from my local watering hole i would be pretty stoked, but to get all in a tizzy about it is simply foolish, which is not true of all the tree house hyped hazy ones by the way, but is true about this one. super dense looking from the 12 ounce can, high frothy white headed and all, but dull a little bit and chewy, not as maybe well refined as expected or as very green was pretty much right next to it. i wish they told you the hops, but then i guess everyone would copycat it, but it seems somewhat conventional, like citra could be driving it along with something just slightly spicy at this dosage, a bit of bitterness which i dont hate, short of green burn, a fine line in this style and they walk it, but i am perhaps seeking a little more. it warms up favorably before the alcohol takes over, i get green pear, orange tic tac candy, and a little white grape, its tasty, even downright awesome, and i like the way it kind of permeates the tongue and hangs after each swallow, its semi permanent on the palate. not oily or slick feeling through, truly a new england type to its core. minimal grain flavor but all the body in the world, nobody would call this balance, and i dont need it to be, but it seems big for the sake of it, like the hops dont even want this much structure, and not that its forced, but just that its not perfect, as the ratings seem to suggest. i like their yeast and its used well here, its a little short on bubbles for a big one, at least for my preferences, and overall the flavor cannot be denied, this is yummy, but is it objectively amazing beer leagues better than the rest in this space? heck no. one of the more anticipated but least epic tree house beers ive cut into, which is still to say its still excellent, but it certainly has a peer group..."

Well, I've only had one English Porter up until now, and it was the second highest rated of the style, Taddy Porter. Now, I'm moving up to the highest rated! I thoroughly enjoyed Taddy, so I'm guessing I'll like this too. Let's jump right in

Pours a clear dark drown with ruby highlights and 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose here is quite soft, but by no means is it dull or boring. I'm picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, sweet toffee, creamy vanilla, toast, raisin, and a hint of earthy hops

Unfortunately, the flavor is mostly dull in comparison to the aroma, just not very exciting but still solid. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting red grape, charred toast, and floral hops. The swallow brings notes of chocolate malt, sweet toffee, earthy hops, and light toast

A medium body pairs with gentle (almost nonexistent) carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet light beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering bitterness and roast

While this wasn't a bad beer by any means, it's far from exciting, even for a classic style. I enjoyed Taddy Porter far better"
London Porter,4.35,"From an 11.2oz bottle dated best before 1 APR 21 into a pint glass.

Pours an opaque very dark brown with about one finger of tan head. Decent retention and a little bit of lacing lingers as I drink the beer.

The first thing on the nose is dark chocolate. There some coffee and smoke in the background.

Taste follows although the smoke flavor is a little more up front and coffee more muted than on the nose. Dark chocolate is noticeable.

Thin but rich, easy drinking mouthfeel. Bitter chocolate aftertaste. Low carbonation.

Overall, this is a fine porter. Would definitely revisit."

It’s not every day you get to have a Cantillon, so I’m super grateful for @Eziel sending this one in a BIF box a few months back! I’m so excited to try this so let’s just get into it

Pours a cloudy deep maroon with 2 fingers of creamy pinkish white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is definitely cherry forward in the nose, but it displays a mature funk that balances it nicely. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry skin, wet hay, fresh leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, and light grape skin

It is similarly funky in taste, but more complex as it shifts throughout the sip. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart cherry, lemon juice, brown sugar, straw, red grape, and light stone. The swallow brings notes of tart cherry skin, wet hay, fresh leather, stone, cracker, red wine vinegar, and light plum

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a tart and funky beer. Finishes a bit sticky but is dried out by the tartness a bit

Mouthfeel is full and incredibly soft; finish lingers with a long-lasting cherry tartness. A treat worth seeking out."
Kriek 100% Lambic,4.8,"2014 Vintage (I think - the label was a bit smudged)

Appearance: Pours the color of pink grapefruit juice with a two finger head that makes a lot of noise as it fizzes down but doesn't completely fade; splotchy lacing

Smell: Barnyard horseblanket, lemon and tart cherry all wrapped in an oak barrel of aromatics

Taste: Funk and oak forward with the dry aspect joining with the lemon/cherry flavors; as the sour receptors on the side of the tongue move into action, the tart cherry flavors increase their prominence

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate to high carbonation; puckery

Overall: It has been a while since I have had a Cantillon and we are just at a different level here from the other Krieks I have tasted in recent times; so much complexity while also being eminently drinkable"
Kriek 100% Lambic,4.61,"Poured from 750ml bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Rosy pink pour with baby pink head that dissipates quickly.

S - Sour, wet straw with faint fruity candy notes. Sweet tarts.

T - Sharp sour taste, tempered by a light bitterness, sour cherry and citrus notes, funky brett in the background.

F - Biting carbonation sting, mouth-watering and juicy.

An amazing balance between lambic and fruit, neither fully tempered by the other."

Moreish indeed - one of the few beers at the tasting I found hard to leave for the next sample."
Kriek 100% Lambic,4.4,"Poured from a bottle (26Jun2017) into an apple wine glass

L: pours a perfectly clear deep red with a nice slightly off white head. Fades after a couple minutes, nice layer of bubbles on the head remains

S: such a nice, wonderfully funky cherry-forward nose. Get that barnyard sour and funk with a richer cherry sweetness providing pleasant contrast. Cherry has some of that cinnamon spice/cherry pie depth to it I really like

T: follows the nose well, funk pleasantly leading the way with that richer cherry flavor coming through beautifully. Slightly sour, mostly deeper cinnamon spice and pleasantly tart. What’s really amazing about this beer is the balance - the lambic and cherry blend together so well, just incredible combination of funk with acidity. Moves toward the finish slightly sweeter, overall medium/short

F: medium- body, medium carbonation, very slightly drying

O: very good kriek, not surprisingly the balance between funk and acidity is otherworldly"

From the back label, ""because of its complex flavor and its acidulous taste, the Kriek Cantillon is a unique and very thirst quenching beer.The ingredients come from organic agriculture . Beer with evolving flavor . Keep and serve at cellar temperature (12-15c). In order to fully appreciate the fruity taste of the Kriek Cantillon , it is recommended to drink within one year after buying it.To be drink preferrably within ten years after the bottling date. Beer with kristen.""

I pop the bottle cap and uncork the bottle. Aroma of cherries, cherries and tartness. Second sniff is cherries . More cherries and tartness . Third sniff is tart cherries, I see a pattern here

Poured into a teku , fizzy, big bubbled pink rose bubbles quickly fade over A ruby red liquid. A few random bubbles float to the top. No lacings over a red liquid

First sip and the Tartness dries the roof of mouth, bone dry . Cherry taste , cherry jam. Second sip tart cherries.third sip is still more cherries and the tartness slightly reduces as the glass warms . Jolly rancher cherry tart

Low sudsing , quenchingly tart , the cherries and tartness linger . My mouth rehydrates with a cherry flavor. Tart cherry flavor covers my mouth , lips and gums.

Good beer, would love to try it fresh at the source in Belgium"
Hommage,4.52,"Pours a pulpy red hue - kinda a dull garnet type of color. This is honestly one of the uglier lambics that I have cast my eyes on. Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so."
Hommage,4.24,"Felt an appropriate day to open this, given the news of Armand's recent passing. Ruby red in the glass with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are balanced between raspberry and cherry pie filling, with a nice lemony acidity from the base lambic. Flavors are tart, a bit less fruity than expected, with more of a raspberry character. Overall I like it, although not quite as much as Framboos

85/100"
Hommage,4.61,"Two year old bottle.

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.

Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""

The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.

Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.

This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age."

Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 1/2 inch light pink head over a hazy cherry red body with no lacing as the head disappears in seconds.

Wonderful nose of cherry and raspberry with slight funk.

Taste mirrors nose with the funk a bit more prevalent.
Very tart in the best way at the finish.
Wow!

Good feel after the initial appearance.

Overall, a delicious lambic!
Seek this one out!!
Cheers!!!"
Hommage,4.28,"Bottled 3 years ago (2018).

Pours deep, medium-hazy red with a finger of off-white head.

The nose is raspberry, cherry, lemon, and vinegar.

The taste opens with medium-sour lemon, vinegar, and green olive and finishes with raspberry and cherry. Very low sweetness and medium tartness. The initial pop of vinegar and green olive is somewhat off-putting, but the beer becomes more balanced and fruity as it warms and my palate adjusts.

The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Puckering tartness with a clean finish.

Overall, a very well-made lambic, maybe not my favorite flavor profile at the end of the day but it definitely grew on me. It could use a touch more jammy sweetness to offset the vinegar."

Hommage,4.5,"Bottled on 9/18/2013 - consumed on 7/18/2021. Poured from a caged-and-corked 375mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler.

Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs.

Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex.

Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering.

Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style.

A fitting tribute - one of the best examples of the style I've had in quite some time."
Hommage,4.29,Another wonderful Belgian Lambic. Love the taste and finish which showcases the cherry and raspberry fruit.
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.2,"Picked up a bottle then realized it is a few months past the enjoy by date. I’m not sure how much that affected it.
Great strong ale. Reminds of some of the Belgians I’ve had. But the IBU’s on this one are too much. The bitterness kind of overwhelms the flavor."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.94,"dark amber, somewhat loose 1 finger head receding to very little. A bit of lacing. Smell is more malt than the taste. Much more bitter in the taste than I expected from look and smell. Clean finish, medium body, but thinner than I expected from the looks."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.34,Not a personal fan of the taste but has an interesting kind of spice to it
Arrogant Bastard Ale,5,"This beer is so good! This was one of the first brews that has extreme levels of hop IBUs that I ever tried, long ago...
Look: Expansive light-khaki colored head that extends a finger above the rim of my snifter, and leaves so much lacing, all atop a cloudy, deep crimson body. Smell is a bit of citrus on top of dark fruit, on top of a hop factory, with caramel drizzled on top of all of that. Taste is relentlessly hoppy, leaving hop resin in the mouth so very thick, leaving an extremely bitter aftertaste, that in my opinion, is quite pleasing. I'd be lying if I said this tasted like anything but a hop hurricane in the mouth. Mouth feel is actually very smooth for being such an abrasively hoppy brew. Carbonation is above average, but it makes this hop tornado so sparkling and delicious. ABV is all there, but I don't know of many people who drink strong ale that shy away from a little booziness. Overall a fantastically hoppy brew. LOVE it."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,1.65,"Too Boozy, hard to enjoy the flavors with its poignant banana peel flavor."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.09,"Older bottle just over a year but hopefully the darker color and abv helped it age. 22oz bomber.

On the pour a fine 1 finger head forms that slowly recedes to a very light covering and a ring around the glass. Light haze, and very dark, a murky reddish brown that lest some but not a lot of light through. Light lazy carbonation, no lacing.

Aroma is very nice despite the age. Some traditional west coast IPA notes and some nice floral aromas on top of an earthy chocolate caramel malt note. Some umami and a slight dryness on the finish presumably from the age, but it all ties together quite nicely.

Flavor follows the aroma pretty closely and introduces some fig and date dark fruit flavors followed by a stouty and hoppy bitterness. Still quite drinkable and smooth despite the bitterness nice and complex, lots of flavor but surprisingly balanced. And not as aggressive as the bottle makes it out to be, but perhaps that's just modern tastes talking.

Feel is quite big and chewy. The abv makes itself known relatively quickly too even when paired with food, and let me tell you 22ozs of 7.2abv will get you there, so don't be an arrogant bastard. Also quite filling.

Overall a beer that's big in every way, hoppy malty, mouthfeel, and abv, but without being completely overwhelming or gimmicky, although a small bit of both. It's a good beer for those who want big malts and big hops."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,5,"wish I had some deep dish pizza to go with this cold donkey piss.
I like it in moderation."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.84,I love this beer! So different from all the others. A nice hit of malts & hops with an incredible bitterness that really lingers. The sweetness of the malt comes thru more as it warms. That bitter aftertaste is so good.
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.22,"Look: Dark bronze/sapphire body with a head that reminds me of a latte. Lacing throughout.

Smell: Raisin bread. slight candied orange notes. Slight grapefruit. Citrus and baking spice if I had to sum it up. Complex indeed.

Taste: Orange zest, intense pine. Some fresh dark bread notes. Slight raisin, slightest black pepper alcohol burn on the finish.

Feel: Creamy body. Quite drinkable for a +7 % ABV. I can't imagine trying this beer on Nitro, I think it'd take it to the next level.

Overall: This is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Distinctly remember it being the early 2010's and becoming burned out on the typical West Coast IPA (ironic because it's come full circle and that's my favorite style yet again) and wanting to try something different. Then and now Bastard has been a refreshing look on a style I'd otherwise not consider. Just a really well-made beer. Probably not your every day brew, but this was a great ""random"" beer to have today."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.3,"Appearance: Pours a clear ruby color with a nice cap of light khaki colored foam.

Smell: Sweet, toasty, floral and slightly medicinal. Islay Scotch barrel aged Robitussin with a massive dose of hops.

Taste: Sharp and bitter hops up front. Malt contributes a bit of sweetness at the get-go but quickly shifts to a drier and heavily toasted taste. It's difficult for me to pick out any one flavor in particular. It's a complex beer but it's also a barrage on the senses. Rye comes to mind as does charred toast, peat, bitter tylenol-like hops and some oak. Heavily bitter all the way through.

Feel: Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry.

Overall: Not an easy drinking beer, but I didn't expect it to be anyway. I can totally understand how some people might not like it, but I've been a fan for close to 10 years now. When I want something to light up my palate I go for one of these. Well worth the money."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.94,"Strong flavor IPA style, very bitter just how i like it, 7.2 on the ABV. This is the perfect balance of bold flavor and ABV, this is my new favorite IPA."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.87,"L: Pours the color of a tarnished penny, a nice khaki head fades to a small cap, nicely laced glass.
S: Malts and hops, maybe a bit of caramel.

F: I expected something thicker, it's well carbonated.
O: Tastes change, I would have like this more years ago."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.74,"Bottled 9/9/21, so not really ""fresh,"" but review what you got

L: Dark reddish brown, cloudy but not opaque. Beige head, nice lacing.
S: Very roasty. Distinct. Almost peppery. A little fruit in there if you squint your nose some.
T: Follows the nose, huge roasted malt character. Doesn't leave room for much else tbh, but a very tiny amount of sweetness sneaks in the middle before the hop bitterness and spice washes it away.
F: Arrogant
O: This beer is still in a class by itself, even now. I appreciate it but I don't know that I need to revisit it. A review of this one is no substitute for trying it yourself..."

Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.88,"I found this in the fridge and couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed it. It pours a dark brownish ruby color with an off-white head. The nose is primarily malt with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is almost identical, with the heavy grain flavor up front and ending with the hoppy bitterness. It must be my bottle, but it feels like the back end of the flavor is missing from what I remember."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.29,"Dark reddish copper, clear, off-white head. Smells like toasted raisin bread, on the subtle side. Theres some light citrus notes as well. There’s an initial taste of caramel malts and biscuit immediately followed by a freight train of intense hop bitterness. You can vaguely taste some slight pine/citrus/spice from the hops but it’s mostly just early addition bittering hops that almost make it seem “hot”. No doubt about it, the labels right, if you’re a casual beer drinker or someone who is not very schooled in beer styles you will definitely not like this. It should be appreciated for how being a well made ale."
Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.97,Properly bitter. Sweet and malty.

Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.38,"Very modest head production; decent retention. Lemon yellow body, opaque and murky but not unattractive or pulpy.

Fresh and hoppy nose, but a bit of a melange of citrus, tropical, and herbal aromas, with little in the way of individual notes to pick out. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, cream; little else that triggers anything. Still, it's a very pleasant, if not particularly complex, aroma profile.

Very juicy on the palate, with tropical notes leading the way, carrying a more restrained citrus edge and some herbal bite. Mango, papaya, pineapple, basil, oregano, lemon zest, mandarin orange. Orange creamsicle finish.

Smooth and creamy bite; top notch in the style."
Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.54,"A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves decent lacing

S: Lots of citrus and tropical fruit up front along with some berries and very light stone fruit

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus, tropical fruit, and berry notes. Picks up the light stone fruit. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus and berries

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the fluffier side

O: A very good DDH DIPA that really brings the Citra. Extremely easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out"
Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,4.4,Decent DIPA but still felt thin and missing the thickness and chewiness you’d expect from a double NEIPA. Good but not great.
V.S.O.J.,4.71,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.

The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine."
V.S.O.J.,4.7,"Pours a dark burgundy that reveals a remarkably clear transparency when held directly against a light. If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.

Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.

Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts.

Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol.

Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV.

For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.

Served neat in a Glencairn glass."
V.S.O.J.,4.66,"Look - basically black with a nice tan head and lacing
Smell - So much barrel with a molasses and hints of dark fruit

V.S.O.J.,4.69,"Batch 2, 2021.

One I’ve been wanting to try for awhile. Revolution Barleywine base with a higher carb than I’m used to, but doesn’t detract at all from the beautiful complexity of oak, molasses, caramel, and bourbon. Mild esters and warmth on the tail."
V.S.O.J.,4.75,12/28/2021: Poured from a 12oz can into a stemless wine glass. One of the best barleywines I've tasted. Mouthfeel and flavor are tremendous. Thanks to Josh for the share.
V.S.O.J.,4.64,"I received a can of this famous Barleywine from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Can dated 6/29/2021. Poured into a Revolution Deep Wood Series glass also received from Mr. Barber. It pours a deep cola color with a fizzy, light khaki-colored head that dissipated quickly. It boasts a great Barleywine smell with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, tobacco smoke, oak, and subtle but discernible bourbon. The taste is ridiculous! It's particularly fruity with lots of raisin, plum, and fig, along with loads of brown sugar and toffee, oaky char, tobacco, and a strong, hot bourbon presence. There is little bitterness. The tastes really pop; it's incredibly flavorful. Its mouthfeel is rich and creamy with appropriate and pleasant carbonation, and there's no escaping the 15% ABV; you can feel the alcohol burn. Overall, V.S.O.J is simply exquisite; one of the best English Barleywines I've had the pleasure to drink."

V.S.O.J.,4.74,"Received courtesy of @ovaltine in NBW BIF#14
Poured dark reddish brown with minimal head that dissipated quickly, no discernible foam either, but continuous bubbles appear from the depths of the glass.
The aroma was bourbon and malts, taste is almost sweet but isn’t, not sure how that happens. Figs, raisins, plums all swirling in the bourbon.
The taste rather follows, just more intense, amazing flavors and the 15% ABV is well hidden. Really, really good.
The feel is viscous enough to carry the weight of the flavors without being cloying. Great sipper!
OA, I think I need to find this whenever it shows up and get some."
V.S.O.J.,5,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a small collection of bubbles topping the poor.

Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze.

Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick but not cloying. It lingered just long enough to have me wanting more.

Overall - This was a fantastic beer."
V.S.O.J.,4.71,"Can. Batch 2. Little head. Caramel copper color.

V.S.O.J.,4.51,"12oz. can into a Founder's snifter. Shared with schen9303.

Pours super dark for the style. A bold mahogany. No head. Sticky, oily, lace that really hangs around. Nose is loads of molasses, oak, booze, and vanilla. I also get anise, brown sugar, and caramel. Very dense and aromatic. Beer opens vanilla, caramel, and molasses. Oak and tobacco in the middle while the sweetness continues to heighten. More molasses, anise, booze, and brown sugar at the end with a sticky, lingering finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Rich and oily on the palate and goes down smooth, rich, and hot. Lingering aftertaste that sticks around for days.

This beer's worth the hype. Really solid overall and made to drink now! Doesn't need any aging."
Thicket,4.49,"This one is really thick (unlike that loser Robin). Yeah, this one is like pure and ripe like the day Bridgette Bardot was born. For reals, it’s just beautiful and it hits you well and good like Bruce Smith trying to make you fumble.

Hut! Hut! Hike!"
Thicket,3.56,"Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21

Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.

Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.

Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.

Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product."
Thicket,4.03,"Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.

Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance.

Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant.

Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry.

Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins.

Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing."
Thicket,4.34,FFBL draft. Holy sour blackberries! This is what a sour is. I enjoy the thick and gloopy fruited stuff but this is a real sour. Tons of lacto on the nose and in the flavor. Nice blackberry flavor with a lot of sour. Puckering! Great fruited sour here.
Thicket,4.48,Blend#2 on tap at SP STL pub
Thicket,4.5,Super sour with nice berry flavors coming through.
Thicket,4.14,"Dark maroon to purple with a short mauve head that loudly fizzles out to nothing quickly.

Taste is super juicy blackberry, to the point of gummies, while dark oak and tannins come in mid-palate, capping off with only the faintest hint of nutty funk in the exhale.

Thicket is really puckering and tingly, yet somehow not painfully acidic at all. A playful effervescence runs thru the medium body coming to a just semi-dry finish.

Julius,4.6,Had this years ago and forgot to rate it. Fortunately a buddy made a run and grabbed 4 of these classics. If treehouse had never developed anything better this would still be a gold standard of the style. Delicious in every way.
Julius,4.53,"On draft at the brewery. Gorgeous in a tulip glass. Good mouth feel, I could definitely crush more than one of these. Tastes of citrus but not overwhelmingly so.

An excellent NEIPA but I could easily name half-a-dozen from around New England that I like at least as much. Clearly more sampling is necessary."
Julius,4.66,"Canned 7/21/22

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.

The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.

The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.

I sipped on King Julius for more than an hour, but I feel like I would crush the regular version all day. Great beer."
Julius,5,Tree house brewery makes the BEST IPAs in the East Coast. Hands down! No competition.
Julius,4.09,"Why is Tree House so hyped? Broad selection? OK, I get that. Rate the brewery high, but not their beers. The IPAs balanced but boring compared to a lot of others that are out there, their flagships like this one included. And I find this one a little too fizzy. I like the taste more than the feel. I'll happily drink it but wouldn't go out of my way for it (which is kind of what you have to do for Tree House)."

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.
Review #7,967"
Julius,4.95,"Very juicy. Great aroma, unlike 95% of all beers on the market. Truly a unique treat."
Julius,4.48,"Hazy body, orange and peach toned; huge head, rocky and white; sticky globs of foam cling to the glass. Outstanding citrus smell; orange and tangerine; oats and other cereal grains. Complex and varied flavors; toasted grain; oats; bread crust; citrus pith; bold bitterness with a touch of phenol expression; moderate alcohol note. Heavy body; velvety; alcohol warmth and dryness

I've been curious about this popular and highly rated beer, and I'm glad my curiosity has been satisfied. It certainly earns its reputation for greatness. It exudes eye appeal, an alluring nose; balanced flavors with fine depth, and gently caresses the palate with a soft, warm dryness. A must-try beer.

Pouring temperature: 49 °F; canning data: JULIUS FOR DAYS 03/22/22"
Julius,4.74,Wonderfully juicy hoppy ipa. Great afternoon beer. Prefer in a glass than a can
Julius,5,The beer that started my IPA love. Incredible juice
Julius,4.5,"It was really good, and I rated it accordingly, but nowhere near as good as I have been led to believe."
Julius,4.69,"6 weeks old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a hazy orange with a white foamy head that leaves a bit of retention. No floaters.

Smell: Ripe orange and tangerine. Hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Orange, tangerine, grapefruit and peach. Medium sweetness. Slightly bitter and zesty.

Feel: Full and juicy. Nicely balanced with a zesty punch. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Probably the quintessential Tree House beer with a clear focus on orange citrus fruits. Not overly complex but outstanding in all its qualities. Perfectly executed. Very full and aromatic despite its relatively low ABV of 6.8."
Julius,3.88,"Canned 2/11/22. Pours a dark, murky orange, briefest off-white head with a few islands of foam, spotty lacing. Nose is moderate resinous hop and pine, light citrus juice, and grain. Found that it really needed to warm up before fruitier notes came out - mango, passionfruit, general sticky tropical fruit. Taste is spicy black and white pepper, grapefruit juice and peel, underripe orange, grassy hop, some hop burn. Mouthfeel is full with prickly carbonation, softer as it warms, dry on the finish, and some alcohol heat as well."
Julius,4.69,"16oz canned 12-7-21. Opened 1-15-22. Courtesy of providence.
3 finger white head rising over the rim of the glass, meringue-like. Fantastic retention. Full, sticky lacing. Opaque and orange-gold tint. Fresh citrus, mango, berries in cream in the aroma. Ripe oranges, tart tangerine and a zest-like bitterness over a creamy base. Vibrant fruit flavors. Full body, super-soft creamy mouthfeel with a pleasant bitterness. Long lasting finish with just a touch of sweetness. Top notch, upper echelon NEIPA.
World-Class."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,3.99,"Pours a hazy golden kinda with a cantaloupe flesh texture. White head. Citrus, marijuana, and a little pineapple. This is a little more citrusy and dank than the raw sugar can delight I get from DDH Double Mosaic Dream, an all time Other Half beer for me. Regardless, this is a good one. It's soft. Possibly a bit more pulpy than I'd want as I do get some vegetal hop character on the back end. Much inferior to DDH Double Mosaic Dream."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.41,"4 months old. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours a hazy dark yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Plenty of floaters.

S: Ripe tropical fruits paired with candied citrus fruits. Mainly mango, pineapple, tangerine and a bit of melon.

T: Pretty much tastes as it smells. Probably even a tad sweeter. Minimally zesty and slightly bitter.

F: Full, smooth and creamy. Low carbonation.

O: Very good single hop IPA that showcases the Mosaic hop variety in a great way. The tropical sweetness is balanced very nicely by the slightly bitter and zesty notes. Quite creamy thanks to the oats and lactose."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.5,"Can poured into a Bell's Brewery snifter

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a creamy off white head that settles to a firm layer and laces beautifully.

S: Jumps out of the glass with bright citrus, juicy tropical and stone fruit, a little pine, faintly grassy, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.

T: Big tropical and stone fruit, passion fruit, mango, lychee, pineapple, peach, apricot, guava, and a hint of blueberry, bright citrus, lemon lime and tangerine, crisp pine, biscuity malt, caramel sweetness, and a touch of lactose.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, soft on the palate, just a touch of hop burn warmth, super drinkable for 8.5%.

O: Holy crap. I don't think I've ever had a Mosaic beer like this. They pulled out some amazing flavors. Super clean, great intensity, maybe a touch on the sweet side, but everything pops. I'm beyond stoked I got to try this."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.75,"An excellent NEIPA and an excellent representation of the Mosaic hop. It’s citrusy and juicy without being obnoxiously so, it’s got a mild bitterness, it’s a bit dank. Very well balanced. Mouth watering finish, good alcohol presence, refreshing and extremely tasty. Easily the best beer I’ve had from Other Half, and probably the best new to me beer I’ve had so far in 2022."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.35,"Poured on tap at the Other Half Location in Philly. Pours a cloudy orange-yellow color medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a bit as it fades. Smells of tangerine, orange, grapefruit and a sweet cream aroma at the end, like a tangerine creamsicle. Taste is sweet but not overly sweet with citrusy tangerine and a sweet cream flavor, again like a tangerine creamsicle with a slight bitterness at the backend. It's smooth, rich, nicely carbonated, an excellent beer."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.25,"Very good, but a little puzzled as to the 100 rating here. I get the typical OH DDH mosaic taste here, a bit of blueberry with the hops, kind of sweet but I think the lactose mutes the hop bite that DDH Double Mosaic Dream brings. Good? Yes. Not as good as the other version."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.62,"Pours a hazy golden amber with a creamy off white head that dissipates quickly. On the nose, lots of citrus, juicy tropical and stone fruit, a little piney with some grassy notes. On the palate, gobs of tropical and stone fruit, bright citrus, and pine/herbaceous notes on the back end, nice biscuity malt backbone with a slight burnt sugar sweetness along with a hint of lactose. Medium body, moderate carbonation, super soft on the palate, very drinkable for 8.5%. Overall, a great imperial oat IPA, The best I’ve tried. It is slightly on the sweet side, but the flavors and mouthfeel meld together perfectly!"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,4.49,"This was a good beer. These Double Hazy are taking the levels up every time. This was creamy credit to the lactose and oats. The pour was a nice light orange and on the nose was tropical almost mango flavor. The flavor was consistent through the palate, great beer, I'll take a 4 pack!"
Lager,3.94,"Solid beer and always has been.
A lager with some balls and body.
Bright, deep golden color with an even brighter white head of dense foam - good legs and cling.
Aroma is traditional German hop up front with an underlying malt sweetness.
Flavor is balanced and complex - for a lager , with clean, mildy bitter finish.
Great light-medium body excellent drinkability."
Lager,3.21,"Pours a clear orange amber, light 0.5"" head, few bubbles of lazy carbonation. Nose is light caramel, baked rye bread, allspice, clove, bit of wet hay. Taste has a mild malt sweetness, very light noble hop character, touch of pine. Mouthfeel is moderate, carbonation light. Overall, the flavors are muted and somewhat flat, which may be the result of some less than optimal bodega storage."
Lager,3.41,"355 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Amber colour, large foamy head. Very nice flowery and fruity sweet aroma. Flavour is somewhat less interesting, some toffee, nuts and dusty hops. Bitter finish."
Lager,2,"""Best before June 20/22""; drank 3/31/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dark orange appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice eggshell head; strong tree-rung lace.

Burnt caramel, stale corn & mild grapefruit notes in the nose; my god, this smells pretty bad, and nothing like any lager I've ever had!

Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Caramel, stale corn, grapefruit & baking soda flavors.

My word, I hope something went wrong here. Bad for any style, but an awful misfire of a lager. I'll try to snag another batch to confirm, but this was awful."

S: cereal malt. Wheat and extremely faint grass hops.

T: light caramel, more cereal malt. Slightly floral. Not overly complex. Bread. Very standard amber lager notes.

F: crisp, medium bodied for a lager, not overly hoppy.

O: a standard but pretty good American amber lager. Would pair easily."
Lager,3.69,"first tried in Paris, of all places"
Lager,4.25,"Blows Yuengling lager and Sham Addumbs Boston lager away, and it's not even close. Cost a little more than either of those imposters, but it's NYC overhyped pricing. Probably the best thing NYshitty can offer the intelligent world."
Lager,4.19,"A- This pours a dark amber/golden color, and shows off generally clear....perhaps with some mild chill hazing. There is multiple steady streams of fizz rising in slow but uniform manner, maintaining a base layer of foamy head. This, by the way is about one and a half fingers in thickness to begin with, before the eggshell colored foam slowly dissipates into a clumpy thin/thick covering over the lager. The lacing is quite sticky too, with a thick film coating the inside of my glass....a very nice looking lager beer indeed!

S- I detect a well balanced blend of caramel sweet malted barley, and the robustness of the Vienna style lager here shines, alongside a mild, yet distinct hop cone bitterness. Floral petals, muted piney notes, grassy dry grain, whole grain mountain bread and on the finish, an ever gentle peppery leafy spice.

T- Now this is a tasty lager! Flavors follow the aforementioned aromas quite closely, with piney nuances balanced out by toffee/caramel sweet malts....these also showcase some toasty quality and there is a dry biscuit graininess on the palate too. Slight pepper spice, and a bread yeast flavor that lingers after the swallow. A very decent flavorful lager!

M/O- Light and crisp in body, with perhaps a slight leaning into medium bodied territory. The carbonation is smooth yet fizzy enough to allow the full flavors to explode on the palate. I find the drinkability factor to be high and would have no issues enjoying this throughout an evening. It is a very tasty lager and in my opinion, one of the best that I have had! Excellent fare!"
Lager,3,Pours a light amber. Light malt aroma. Medium hop body. A light hop finish. Slightly bitter. A little skunky. Not that good.

Gratitude,4.27,"2022 vintage, 12 oz can

pours a very dark copper color. clear. thick cream colored head. great head retention. very nice aroma - toasty caramel malt, classic C-hops - citrus, dank pine. similar flavors in the taste, good balance between the malt and firm bitterness. just a touch boozy. sticky mouthfeel, medium bodied."
Gratitude,3.73,"Pours a bright, almost glowing light amber. Plenty of head that for some reason reminded me of a tan macaron in both color and texture. Overall, this is an attractive beer.

Aroma is sweet caramel and molasses with fig and some light alcohol lurking. It's fairly reserved overall, in that nothing bursts from the glass. That said, it still smells quite good.

On the tongue, the alcohol makes a clear and immediate impression, as does the bite from the hops. The malts definitely take a back seat. There's a little bit of sweetness, but it's clearly secondary.

Full bodied and silky smooth. There's a little bit of alcohol warming on the way down, but it's subdued. Low to medium carbonation. Very long finish.

Overall, a good Saturday sipper!"
Gratitude,4.21,"Not sure how I dont have this rates?! I've had it several times before.

I'll rate this 2022 can

The amber hue is beautiful. Also noting hefty sediment st the bottom of the glass.

The smell isn't mind blowing. Its fairly benign and unassuming.

The flavor profile is very bigfoot-esque but definitely better. Its less bitter than Bigfoot and has more caramel sweetness. Still, a pretty bitter and quintessential example of an American barleywine. In fact... i would argue this is probably THEE American barleywine measuring stick. Bigfoot is just too much of a palate wrecker though it does convey all the aspects to familiarize one with the style. Gratitude does it equally as well but with more refinement IMO.

The feel is a little sticky up front but dries out quickly on the finish as you exhale an evaporating heavy dose of ethanol.

Overall Im drinking this one at cellar temperature of about 57ish and I'm not enjoying it quite as much as I recall previously. Could be a beer thats better more chilled, could be I'm off (very likely), or could be accurate at 4.25."
Gratitude,4.41,"poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. pours like sun tea or apple cider with a one finger off-white foam head. lot of dried, dark fruits in the nose. maybe even some burnt sugar / caramel. taste follows with a pleasant fruity wet cardboard barleywine flavor. this is pretty old school American in the sense that it’s not very toffee or caramel forward. more hoppy and fruity. it has a wonderfully full mouthfeel; enough carbonation but it’s still creamy and way too east drinking for 11%. even as it warmed up it still maintained an easy drinking stature with wonderful fruity, hoppy undertones. good stuff."
Gratitude,4,"Pours a deep burgundy-caramel color with a couple fingers of off-white foam. Transparency is obscured by a firm haze. Aroma is fig, raisins, molasses, toffee, and strong earthy, toasty, and caramely malts underneath. Resiny, earthy hops extend the nose a bit further, adding a light stickiness that's overshadowed by a dirty, earthy note. It really leans more into an earthy nose, with malts and hops building on this quality. Booze is obscured. Flavor profile is caramel, toffee, molasses, fig, and raisins layered over malts and hops. Malts are forward, coming by way of earthy, caramely, and toasty, they ride the heels of the former list of flavor notes. Hops don't become apparent until the after taste, which carries a heavy sticky, resiny hop quality, in addition to mild dank and pine. It never leans into sweet, nor bitterness, striking a middle-of-the-road balance. Booze never pops through. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a still, boiled texture. Overall, driving malts and big, sticky hops keep this one lively. It's simplistic, perhaps a little 'old school', but is otherwise clean. Allowed to warm quite a bit, between sitting it out before the pour photo, and playing some Wii Resort Golf, it warmed towards 55F. It become more muddled as it warmed, which is contradictive to the style.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. 2022 vintage, consumed / reviewed in March 2022."
Gratitude,3,"Thanks to Pinz412 for this one, from one of the NBS BIFs (I think Spring '21). unsure of the vintage; bronze label with dark purple wax, and a red cap. 22oz bottle poured into 16oz tulip Poured a very muddy medium-dark brown color with just a thin cap of tan head that had low retention and almost no lacing.

The aroma had the expected sweet malts of the style, some caramel, and a slight mustiness.

Same on the tongue, with the addition of a bit of unpleasant bitterness on the finish. Some alcohol heat as well.

The body was the expected full, sweet, and had a semi-sweet finish that dried out after a few moments.

Drinkability was OK, but was hurt by a lack of carbonation.

Overall, I really wanted to like this brew a lot, but it was just lacking all across the board. I still think I'm being generous with my score. Maybe it's better fresher, or older, or a different vintage. I dunno. YMMV."
Gratitude,4.21,"Sampling a 2016 vintage of this beer. Pouring from a 22 oz waxed bottle at cellar temp into my snifter. Ive got 3 additional vintages in the cellar, probably gonna open some of them over the next couple weeks.
the beer pours a slightly cloudy and muddy colored tan to chestnut hue. Definitely some sediment in the bottle and I leave about an oz of sludgy materials in the bottle.
A dense and creamy khaki colored head foams up about 4 cm on the pour. This foam remains as a thin edge layer and one large island in the center of my glass throughout the sampling.
The aroma on this beer is some dark fruit, raisins and plum and red grape, also I get some fig and a good hit of booze. There is a bit of toffee and brown sugar note, but hops are absent completely. There is a little bit of an ""old beer"" smell, not really oxidation and not really a bad smell, sort of musty attic kinda thing.
First sip reveals a lighter than expected body with very fine and tingly carbonation. Texture is smooth but does coat my palate on each sip.
Flavor is similar to the nose, brown sugar and some toffee, but also a lot of dark fruits, some tobacco here which is new, and again a decent peppery booze bite on the finish. Not really any heat, but definitely reminds me not to chug this glass of beer. Also a lot of sediment in the bottom of my glass, so gonna have to be careful with last couple sips.
Overall a nice barleywine, will be interesting to see how the vintages differ from each other!"
Gratitude,4.1,"Murky orangey brown with a white ring with surface islands. Barley, toffee, date, red grape, and brown sugar in the nose, barley has a hint of must to it as well. Taste has big sharp barley with oxidation and toffee in its wake, dark fruits, surprisingly big grape, astringent caramel, and light soggy toast round out. Feel is not the most refined with barley snarl and booze leading, smooth malts with medium heavy weight balancing. Fun to finally try it"
Gratitude,4.29,"A: The beer is hazy dark caramel in color. It poured with a quarter finger high off white head that left a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light to moderate aromas of toffee and caramel are present in the nose along with notes of apple.
T: The taste follows the smell and has flavors of toffee along with underlying hints of hops and associated bitterness.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This is a slow sipper, but isn't as boozy as I would expect for something that is 11.5% abv.

Serving type: can"
Gratitude,4.03,"Bomber from Tavour. Ruddy, caramel colored pour, lasting cap of creamy beige head. Full aroma of raisins, caramel, tobacco and leather. Taste is malty and sweet, booze pops out right away, dead leaves, tobacco, brown sugar. Rich, full, heavy. A pleasure to sip on."
Gratitude,3.4,"BOTTLE: 2015 vintage 750ml brown glass bottle with orang wax-ed over pry-off crown cap courtesy of Zed - thanks, man! He brought it from Pittsburgh, PA to New Orleans, LA for me straight from East End Brewing.

Currently #11 on the American Barleywine list. #21 in the top Pennsylvania beers list. Served chilled into stemware. ""Barleywine-style ale."" 11.0% ABV.

APPEARANCE: Still has ~2cm of head even 5 years on. Retention is excellent - ~8 minutes. Creamy enough and coating with apt thickness for the style. Leaves no lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes.

BODY: Murky auburn-brown. No yeast/lees or sediment is visible. Not vibrant nor dull. Dark. Nontransparent. Translucent.

Appears well carbonated...surprisingly so for a 5 year old barleywine. Seems true to style. I'm eager to try it.

AROMA: Green apple, marmalade, scintillae of butterscotch, English toffee, caramalt, sugarplum but no other dark fruits (no dates, no prune, no fig, no raisin/grape or stonefruit). Fruity yeast is prominent but it's mature...not a beer with a lot of raw sweetness. Seems well attenuated going off of the aroma.

No barrel notes/oak, vanillin, or the like. No toasted or charred characteristics. I don't detect any overt hoppy aromatics.

Aromatic intensity is moderate. Doesn't suggest a boozy ale...I wouldn't guess it was 11% if I went into this blind.

The matured green apple dominates inasmuch as I can discern. I detect no off-notes.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Silky and coating, giving a nice sleek softness to the beer and presenting its mature fruity notes nicely. Date, sugarplum, fruity ale yeast esters, caramalt, faint vanillin. I'm not getting any toasted oak, charred sugars, burnt malts, nougat, or the like...it's not overtly English in character. No nuttiness or toffee. But also no American hopping...it's a biteen vinous, actually.

Well carbonated. Medium to full-bodied on the palate...not too weighty or overbearing. Not chewy per se, but it's certainly thick.

Bends a bit too far towards a grape-like sweetness coupled with a dry vinous-like texture for my tastes. But maltwise it's well attenuated despite the presence of ample residual sugars. A bit more yeast oomph would help it balancewise, but it's well built for the intended style even though big fans of the style may crave more hop flavour. Not as mature or ""old"" in taste as other 5 year aged barleywines.

OVERALL: I'm certainly keen on seeing how the bourbon barrel aged variant presents...this is a nice barleywine. Drinks quite easily for an 11% ABV barleywine. The finish is a bit borderline medicinal...probably from that pesky vinous flavour. A bit too sweet for me to want to take down a bottle solo, but it's a lovely brew to share with a mate. I can't say I'd seek it out over a widely available expression of the style that's just as good or better (e.g. Great Divide Old Ruffian). I'm glad I tried it once, but $15 is steep for the quality relative to its competition.

I do love its soft silky mouthfeel above all else.

B- / WORTHY"
Gratitude,3.77,"This is a review of the 2009 bottle. Consumed over Thanksgiving, 2016.

Pours a tobacco dark brown color. Beige head that doesn't really hold, if I had to give it a measurement, it would be like that 1/30"" ring. I'm gonna bump its appearance score because its the rare occasion where the awesome packaging (paper bag) or artwork will give the appearance a little bump. Aroma of malty booziness. Lower hopped than your average American barleywine. Usual rolo descriptor here.

Toasted caramel bread and plain graham cracker notes, usual toffee descriptors, maybe mention some candy with toffee or caramel in it. Mild raisin and chocolate presence. The boozy somewhat brandy like heat, while not massive, it is present and brings out bitterness notes even more, like a multiplier. Carbonation was soft and ideal. Some hop notes give it a mellow citrus inflow into caramel town.

Glad leftpaw scored some of these before he left PA."
Gratitude,4.38,"Clear shimmering copper to dark bronze w/ a tall airy but dense khaki head that recedes to a thick blanket w/ loads of retention, leaving some tall curtain lacing w/ wobbly peaks.

I can't believe I haven't had any East End beers prior to today, but this is another old school malt bomb. That's not a bad thing but man is their stuff a blast from the past.

Gratitude 2019, released 3/21/2020 w/ purple wax, is lightly toasty, hoppy, & in the semi-bitter American vein, while leaving a pleasantly sweet kiss of mapled brown sugar on the lips after the semi-dry swallow. A touch of sticky toffee pudding plus a hint of hard cherry candy comes out as it warms.

This is far more pleasant & drinkable compared to tongue thrashers like Arrogant Bastard, & the frothy, fluffy medium body is impressively clean & smooth, w/ a touch of heat to it that is reminiscent of brandy w/ some Brazil nuts on the side.

---

Only a few days after this initial review, I had the pleasure of opening a 2013 bottle, & the results are as follows:

Appearance is hazier, even opaque brown to dull red, w/ a short khaki head that quickly fizzles out to a spotty film.

This is certainly fruitier than it's younger sisters, but also toastier, w/ a pumpernickel cracker influence all over the medium, tingly body. It's no where near as oxidized as I'd imagined it'd be--it seems this was very well packaged & sealed, between the beautiful paper wrap & the solid purple wax job.

Some figgy raisin & cocoa dusted date make up the additional fruit presence, but there's also a nice, mild boozy sting I don't recall from the newest vintage, which helps it deliver a fresh feel to the palate. As it warms there's even a slight cracked black pepper presence almost emulating a barrel-aged experience.

As some states tried to scratch & crawl out of the pandemic lockdown on 5/2/2020, I opened a 2016 yellow waxed bottle. It displayed a nice tall tan foam head that was fluffy, lumpy & exhibited excellent retention, clinging in wide waves of lace over a foggy acorn reddish-brown body. A little bit of unexpected heat lies in the fruity sweetness, while there's still some brown toast, a touch of graham & even some winter spices. Again, it almost seems like there's a touch of oak at times. The medium body has a nicely soft, foamy carbonation that comes to a semi-dry finish.

---

9/2020: I enjoyed a 2018 blue waxed bottle & I'll be damned if it wasn't as though it was just brewed. It has maintained that fiery, resinous hop presence that's sharply dry, while also exhibiting that sense-awakening, flame-kissed orange zest, as its medium body & filling froth satisfy throughout.

On New Year's Day 2022, I popped my papered blue jay bottle & found the experience to be substantially different from that first 2018 bottle. To be clear, I'm not saying the paper had any influence, but like other vintages, its medium-fullness is impressively fluffy soft, finishing gently chewy dry & lightly warming. Where it differed most is in the malt showcase of toasted pumpernickel that even leans into slightly charred gingersnap cookie bottoms--that molasses, malt, & caramelized sugar interplay--it expresses way deeper flavors than before. That said, there were several little black flecks in the beer that came off its deterioratingly rusty cap, which is weird as I've opened much older Gratitude bottles that did not exhibit this, & this was stored vertically. Once I plucked those out--however off-putting that was--it was a treat to sip over a long session while watching Leonardo DiCaprio lose his mind in the fitting parallel to the past two years in Don't Look Up.

---

10/2020: I opened a 2014 red waxed bottle. How well these hold up continues to impress me. In fact, this might possibly be the best non-BA vintage I've had thus far. It's got caramelly-nougat, American piney-ness, & even a toasty woodiness. As it warms, a touch of butterscotch wafer accents the full yet light fluff it manages to retain after all this time, finishing paper dry w/ a touch of heat, exhaling toasted pumpernickel.

---

On 1/3/2021, I enjoyed a 2015 orange wax & again found myself so impressed w/ the preservation of carbonation AND the quality of the brew. For a more old school, non-BA American-style bitter barleywine, it's so caramely, nougaty, & woody, w/ a bit of orange lozenge & Werther's. My only complaint is the huge amount of sediment that came out after my second pour, which I don't recall seeing in other vintages.

---

On 2/19/2022, I finally had the pleasure of enjoying the most recent vintage fresh on draft at the source for Gratitude Day, & oh my, was it wonderful. On top of its classic barleywine notes, there are hints of apple pie, pumpernickel cracker & honey, w/ only a lightly stanky hop aroma in passing wisps. I can't believe this is my first time having a draft pour, but I'm just glad I didn't miss the boat entirely. Absolutely scrumptious."
Gratitude,4.19,"22 oz bottle

Pours hazy amber brown, yellowish head is firm and retains as a sudsy lacing.

Aroma is of pine, molasses, honey, toast, grassy malts, cereals and zest.

Flavor is of rich molasses, caramel, maple, brown sugar, pine, walnut, apple and honey.

Full syrupy body, light carbonation.

Rich, decadent and slow-drinking. Very delicious but heavy. Definitely worth trying and something that would age well. Looking forward to trying a bottle with a few years of shelf life."
Gratitude,4.83,"2016 yellow wax. Pours a rich toffee brown, eager fluffy cap that settles into about a quarter inch barm. Aroma suggests a harmony between English & American barleywine: leads with fire-roasted nuts, treacle & a hint of caramel before a wave of bright, floral hops hits your nose adding burnt orange, pine & limoncello. Very nicely balanced and deep.

The taste is a little less hoppy, with some of those classic English notes taking the wheel. Toffee brittle, mild butterscotch, caramel. But there is enough of that hop presence to highlight and compliment those more robust notes, adding ruby grapefruit and piney citrus. A tad fusel at the end but that is a minor thing.

The hype around gratitude may have fallen off in recent years but it is a world class barely. Rich, robust and expertly balanced between the malt & hops."

S: chocolate, coffee, bourbon.
T: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon heat, oak. Roasted malt, burnt coffee.
F: medium, fair bourbon burn.
Overall: pretty good especially for epic abv, but not great. A little thin, a little too boozy. Coffee flavors are old the old/stale/burnt side."
Mocha Wednesday,4.53,Boozy. But still has that mocha kick it advertises.
Mocha Wednesday,4.68,"Appearance was tan to dark, nose was a little coffee and some sweetness, taste still had great coffee and plenty of oak and vanilla, feel was velvet and smooth similar to a good barrel aged wheat wine. Amazing that this beer packs a 19%+ abv. Overall, still drinking fantastically four years later."

Mocha Wednesday,4.7,"Bottle dated 1/10/19 poured into a DFH Signature Glass. Body is inky black with a quickly receding soapy head that left zero lacing. Aroma is bourbon, malts, coffee, and dark fruits. Taste is alcohol, cherries, chocolate, coffee, coconut, and vanilla. This beer gets more complex as it warms. Overall this isn’t better than Black Tuesday, but it’s still a world-class BBA Stout."

Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.21,"11.2oz bottled Sept. 2020 (about 18 months ago) poured into a chalice at 53° Fahrenheit 10% ABV. The beer pours opaque, honey colored amber with very light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of varied sized bubbles leaving just a few small bits of lacing. The aroma is fairly sweet with pale malt, berry and peach. The taste is semisweet and a hint tart with well attenuated pale malt, hints of berry and melon before a mildly bitter, citrus like finish. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. No trace of the ABV in the aroma and just a touch in the taste. Overall, very good."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4,This one was pretty good. Seemed to lean more heavily into the fruity ester notes along with a nice malty backbone and some belgian spiciness. Enjoyable to drink.
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.24,"Well what an nice Belgium tripel! One of my new favorite tripels. Cloudy, fruity hints of apricos, bananas and citrus. Soft- bitterness- well hidden alcohol."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.64,"L - Hazy golden wheat colored pour with a think white head which dissipates to a thin fine laced foam.

S - Citrus rind, marmalade/stewed apricot, dried grassiness.

T - Stone fruit with light syrup and a clean medicinal bitterness on the finish.

F - Slightly thick and juicy , finishes dry, well hidden alcohol.

A very pleasant and well balanced experience, not leaning in any particular direction. Not too much of anything. Unlike most tripels which rely on the orange and coriander."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),2.76,"12 oz. can. Cloudy and chunky orange. Smells of citrus, light acidity, a little cardboard. Tastes of citrus and orange sourness, fruity yeast, and a little yeasty bitterness. Medium heavy. I don't remember this being sour. Maybe I'll revisit this review with another can from my 4 pack if this is an isolated incident."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.51,"2013 vintage, poured into a teku

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger creamy white head that has great retention long after the pour, eventually leaving some lacing behind

S- fruity and peppery on the nose, opening with aromas ripe red apples, pears, oranges, apricot and banana. Undertones of clove, cracked pepper, spicy yeast, coriander, and musty basement

T- fruity and spicy yeast up front gives flavors overripe pear, apples, orange zest and peppery clove. Mid-palate gives a cider like flavor with a hint of lemon. The give more fruity yeast, with a light phenolic linger

M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns into a creamy, slightly warming finish

Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4,"L: Pours deep gold with a medium haze. A gentle pour results in a fine, off-white two finger head with decent retention. After several minutes the head has fallen to a 5mm ring with the interior of the glass having an insubstantial sheet of head. It leaves a but of spotty lacing as the beer goes down.

S: I get notes of citrus, a note or two of apricot, some spiciness, some notes of banana, and a hint of bubblegum. Nothing too complex or groundbreaking here. The nose may be a bit faded?

T: Apricots, citrus peel, cloves, a bit of herbal earthiness, and sweet oranges on the backend. The finish has some spiciness and has a gentle bitterness.

F: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is crisp and the finish has a nice dryness.

O: This is a good tripel. I wanted a bit more from the nose and palate, but recommended if you are into the style or if you are just looking to try a good Belgian beer."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.25,"Aug 2019 bottle. White head. Golden orange color. Lace.

Really nice Belgium spice, not overpowering. Yeast, banana, clove, bananas. Other tripel spices. Very drinkable, very smooth."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.22,"Pours hazy and flat, bit of a shame on the head....perhaps served too chilled?

Aroma is superb, punchy, fruity, malty.

On the tongue just wins, same malty fruit can mes through, slightly sweet but not overpowering, no sense of high abv.

Feel is also quality, really smooth, sweet on the tongue runs into the aftermath. Nothing harsh at all. Quality brew

Overall......not the stereotypical Tripel, but my my a mighty fine one at that. This is a gem! A fruity rooty boozy beauty!, Just do it"
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.46,"From an undated 330 ml bottle but I am assuming it is a 2019 batch. Sampled on July 5, 2020.

It is an attractive looking medium amber, mahogany pour underneath a lacing-leaving soft white head.

Whoa! Check out those caramel malts in the aroma! They abound. But also a bit of candied sugar, molasses, dark fruit like fig, and maybe some butterscotch.

The mouthfeel is smooth, medium to full, and chewy.

A very sweet tasting Belgian Tripel compared to some of the more crisp, clean ones. The malt sweetness warms the insides. Caramel characters are all over the flavor. And there is a biting bitterness like rosemary or something hopped up. Not overly fruity but definitely a warming, bitter and satisfying bite for ""malt-heads"" like me. It deserves it's BA ""Outstanding"" rating."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.05,"L- First off, this is quite probably the most gratuitously ugly lable design I have seen on ANY beer, never mind just the 1100+ I have reviewed here. It's like ....erm a 15 year old kid gets punched by his proto-girlfriends junkie mother for stealing her gear, and in frustration in class at school he uses purple and yellow highlighter pens to draw this sketch with thunderbolts coming out of her ears. On the bright side it can't possibly be worse than the lable looks. [To be clear, this < ^ is NOT relected in my Look/rating that's of the beer in the glass].
Quite deep amber with hints of orange, slightly cloudy, pours with 1Cm pale tan head [ps. which holds reeeally well].
S- Pretty typical for a Belgian Tripel, deep, some roasted fruits, slightly toasty, you just know there is going to be a solid ABV% coming soon...
T- ... and boy is this one a belter. Deep roasty rich pungency, then after I swallow the first mouthful I involuntarily shudder as a notably rich + ABV% + pungent hoppy note kicks in late! This repeats, this beer seems to have a real kick in it's finish.
F- Rich yet pungent, well balanced. Very good carbonation in the mouth. I'd suggest serving with a decent chill as this is warming a touch already but seems to be sweetening up faster.
O- Big powerful yet refined. Zero to note out of place or balance. Very nice I'd happily buy again. For a very nice trad style beer (blind tasted this could have come from a monastry), I maintain it has the oddest and most contrasting lables you could suggest.

Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.35,"Poured from bottle into tulip, massive 4 finger off white head, epic retention and lacing. Hazy dark golden in the glass, some sediment floating around (I was rough on bottle, leaked in bag on the way home from store, was sure this was ruined). Smells of belgian esters, floral and lemon with a slight underlying funk. Taste is initially sweet malt, candi sugar, raisins, floral, warming spice, pear man lots going on here. Very good tripel, not your run off the mill one note job. This is a very enjoyable tripel."
Dulle Teve (Mad Bitch),4.63,"2021 UPDATE:
Upping the score upon having a much more fresh bottle. The complexities are exquisite. Smoot fruit and peppry yeast up front; spritely booze and candi sugar in the middle; and an incredible melange of hops and yeast on the back and finish.


H... h....

Ho...

How...

How on earth have I not reviewed this?

It was never anymore rare than the other De Dolle beers. Which is to say, it's gotten harder to find stateside in the past several years, but if you were fortunate enough to live in an area where a distributor or two cared about Belgians pre-2010 or so, it could have been had at a price that at the time seemed high but now would cost about as much as an upstart blueberry NEIPA. So, erm, I guess I never felt much urgency to write a review. And I also always kinda assumed I already did.

The pour is dark for a tripel. It's fizzy, but not over carbed the way some otherwise good Belgians are. A very regular pour for the style.

The aroma is a nice, deep sweetness: nectar, flowers, yeast. It's not super complex, but it's balanced and interesting.

Flavor is very good, borderline great. The aforementioned floral sweetness of the aroma shines through up front, and if the beer had progressed along those lines it'd be be near-perfect. Alas, it melts down into a more alcoholic brew typical of a other tripels--which isn't to say it's not very good, just that it's not other-worldly. It's still pretty darn well balanced. Fruity in the middle, light alcohol burn on the back, and then some grain and yeast complimenting the fruit on the finish.

I think of this more like a very sweet Belgian Dark than a tripel. At any rate, it's a weird iteration of both styles, and pretty darn good no matter how you approach it. Not world-crushing, but certainly worth the 5 bucks I paid for a 12 ounce bottle."
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.34,12oz can. 2022.
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.76,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This has a nearly perfect vanilla aroma to it, just so authentic, decadent, but not overly cloying, with dark chocolate, bourbon, dried black cherry, and coffee.

The vanilla treatment here is nearly perfect - reminds me of something like Vanilla Rye in its prime (not now). It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel.

This is thick bodied, sweet, decadent, but not overly so, with no booziness, and a very creamy smooth finish.

It's nice to see a simple take on a pastry stout done so well these days - sometimes all it takes is the expert use of one flavor."
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.5,"Following the Monster's Park, this was an awesome way to start a bottle share. It was going to hard to compete with these two for the rest of the night. Black, still, oily pour. Big boozy nose with underlying vanilla. Taste presents the roast malts, a healthy dose of vanilla, plus the bourbon barrel. Sweet and warm. A real gem."
Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,4.5,"Everything you could want in a BA Vanilla stout. Pours very dark, nice head, perfect thickness. Lots of nilla and a touch of barrel heat. Another great MTV"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.19,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before.

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Clean, not overpowering taste. Rich, smooth feel. I wish I had another bottle!"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.9,Natural flavors added that shite will kill you straight away.
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.01,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Wilmington Brewing Company Can Glass

The beer pours nearly pitch black with only the lightest ruby highlights, and about two fingers of dense light tan head that slowly recedes into a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a minimal amount of lacing

The aroma is dark & milk chocolate, coffee, and some roasted malts. Very pleasant and inviting.

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The chocolate is complimented with the roasted malts. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and more pronounced milk chocolate flavors. Light/medium bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, that is very smooth and easy to drink. Quite enjoyable"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.28,"A-Dark earth in color with a thick moka head that linger thanks to the nitrous in the bottle
S-Notes of raisins, rum and plum. With a dark chocolate underlay of fragrance
M-Lower end carbonation with a watery mouthfeel. Body is somewhat resinous.
T-Sweet lactose upfront with a chewy bitterness that resembles very dark chocolate
O-Solid beer!"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.9,"Pours a very deep, dark brown. The look is black, but held to a light you can see the deep ruby shades going through. No beer so far that’s been nitro’d has the ability to pour as big a nitro head as Guinness — but Young’s comes very close, with a thick, dense finger tall head that looks a little more watery and a little more creamy than other nitro stouts. Hard to ever rate nitro beers low on the looks department.

Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, chocolate dust, cacao beans, roasted coffee, caramelized sugar in sticky toffee pudding, and light burnt and toasty malts. What can you say? It’s good!

Taste follows the nose, but is regrettably more watery with a thinner body than the nose suggests. They do not lie about the chocolate, dark chocolate intermingles with milk chocolate on the finish, which is a bit sweeter. Gentle bitterness from the roasted malt on the front. Earthy with a nice almond-esque nuttiness throughout.

Based on the style I’m almost tempted to say this is a lighter bodied stout but I’d say it’s square in the medium bodied category. This is straight up nitrogenated, there is barely even a tickle of the tiny bubbles on the palate. Not quite flat, however, this creates a very very smooth mouthfeel. As smooth as you can possibly get, even more than other nitro stouts. Semi-dry finish that leans to the sweet side.

I will be honest, I came into the review a little disappointed. I am used to Young’s like the picture on BA, the nice dark glass in the regular carbonation. Ironically, I actually love nitro stouts. But years ago when I first started drinking good beers, I loved to split Young’s with a friend. One of the first real chocolate stouts on the market, and it was so good. Not sure if I’ll ever find a bottled one again.

That all being said, this was still not bad. You sacrifice certain aspects and bolder flavours for the smoother ride of the nitro when you go for the widget can. This is still a remarkable beer, one that is actually pretty easy drinking for people used to stouts and nitros. Could easily have a few in a night. The flavours are subtle but varied and complex enough to make a great beer."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black, color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 22-23. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of English cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa nibs, some earthy black malts. Smooth lactose. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. Some tobacco & smoke. This smooths into a milk chocolate, dark malt, and creamy lactose on the end. (3.75)

Feel: Lighter bodied. Low carbonation. Drinks sort of flat with tobacco bitterness and cocoa lingering on the finish. (3.50)

Compared to Founders' Porter 3/7/22: Pours a similar color, milder and lighter head. Milder aromas. More bittersweet chocolate, tobacco bitterness. Less chocolate, espresso, lactose. Lighter body.

Overall: An English Stout for sure with the bittersweet chocolate and tobacco notes intermixed with the chocolate. Lighter-bodied and under-carbonated in my opinion. Has the English flavors, but that was about the only thing I found enlightening about this beer. (Final Rating: 3.73)"
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.8,"4pk of 12oz bottles (Best before 23 JAN22) picked up at the Arundel Preserve Wine and Spirit: Hesitated a long time prior to trying this, ""Double Chocolate"" sounded like way too much chocolate. Frankly, could barely smell it and even that might have been ""peer pressure"". More, but thankfully NOT overwhelming chocolate on the tongue with some malt thrown in. A smooth drinker, but I don't think I'll be coming this way again anytime soon."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.78,The pour was a very smooth dark chocolaty pour. The smell reminds me of a very strong malt chocolaty smell on the nose. The taste was actually very surprising as you could taste the malts and chocolates. Over all this stout is very unique in it's own way and I would definitely enjoy a bottle every weekend!!!
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.23,"Pours a beautiful, inviting head with aromas similar to a chocolate milk, rather than chocolate itself. On the palate, the beer is much more straight forward with a heavy blend of both milk and dark chocolate qualities and roasted malts, much to my surprise of the rather subtle aroma. Moderate carbonation with a perfect lingering finish. Extremely creamy and smooth; like a Nitro brew. The smoothest beer I've had which actually blows my mind. Beautiful combination of a strong chocolate taste without being too heavy or sweet, which comes unexpected from the much lighter aroma."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.76,"Pours jet black with a 0.5"" tan head, settling out to a solid ring, nice streaky lacing. Nose is chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and light roast. Taste is milk chocolate, a bit of bitter baking chocolate, and some deeper roast notes. Mouthfeel on the thin side, but helps avoid this from getting too heavy. Delivers noticeable chocolate flavor without becoming overly sweet or heavy. Warrants respect for its subtlety."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.03,"I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes. I was surprised it was not on draft, but perhaps it was because it was summer. Still, it was a cool and rainy day in mid-June."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.47,"Look: This was poured from widget can, so the bottle pour might be very different. Pours a rich dark brown on hair below black. Pours like a Guiness with all the seperation expected. BIg 2 finger tawny head. The head lasts forever still a finger high at 5 minutes. The head is dense and marshmellow like. Sticky as can be.

Smell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated.

Taste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness.

This beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-

Feel: Very watery up front, but it finishes with a creamy dryness."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.01,"Pours similarly to a Guinness, just a lot darker. Smells mostly like cocoa, with a slight coffee aroma. The taste is very chocolaty, and with the bitterness of the beer, its like a very dark chocolate. Like an 80% dark chocolate. The beer is extremely creamy, and creates a wonderfully pleasant feeling. The perfect carbonation for a stout. Almost smoother than a nitro brew. This beer is very good and i would highly recommend it to a fan of stouts."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.4,"Look: So dark that light can't pass through it. Like my soul :3c nice persistent foamy head
Smell: Chocolate (DUH ITS CALLED CHOCOLATE STOUT DUHHHHHHHHHH), tobacco, Bailey's
Taste: It has chocolate flavor, but is missing the creaminess that I personally associate chocolate with. Notes of malt and black coffee. Strong black coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste.
Feel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this.
Overall: One of the better stouts I have drank, but I am not much of a stout cat. Its not too dry which I like, and the flavor is not intense so it is very drinkable."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,3.92,"Looks great. Dark with smooth creamy head. The Widget really does its job. Scent is too weak, even taking into account the thick head. I liked the roasted slight hint of chocolate taste but I'm not a chocolate and coffee beer enjoyer. I feel for the style the chocolate could have been group out more prominent. Smooth perfect bitterness feel."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.18,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.

Smell - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, coffee bean, earthy and leafy hops, dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig), and earthy yeast.

Taste - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, and coffee bean upfront. The earthy and leafy hops come through next followed by the dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering.

Overall - A flavourful sweet stout that delivers on all flavours. I am impressed on how velvety smooth this beer is with all the bold elements in it. A stand out in this category and deserving of a try from those that haven't sampled it yet."
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,4.47,"the head is perfect, super smooth."
In Perpetuity,4.15,"Pours light hazy orange, half-inch head with moderate lacing. Nose is mango, passionfruit, fruit punch, and very light resin. Taste has light tropical sweetness, light pine and resin, with a pleasant bittering aftertaste. The finish is also on the dry side, while the mouthfeel, though not thin, isn't as silky soft as other TH NEIPAs. Overall, a nice, balanced NEIPA that stands out among other offerings."
In Perpetuity,4.6,"Canned 9/17/20, tasted 11/2/2020. Really enjoyed this one! On the lighter side, as an IPA rather than a DIPA, but packed a ton of flavor in there. The smell in particular was impressive - just a powerful, appetizing aroma. The mouthfeel was a tad thin for my taste, but otherwise, a deliciously bitter and juicy hazy IPA."
In Perpetuity,4.59,"I have been fortunate to get a wide variety of TH beers over the past five months and this is one of the best beers I have had of theirs. Smooth, and just plain tasty. Try it you will like it!"

In Perpetuity,4.52,"Fantastic NE IPA from Tree House. Full of flavor, great aromas and feel. 1/29/20 date printed on can. Pours a beautiful hazy slightly darker yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and some nice soapy rings of lingering lacing. Smells of ripe orange, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, papaya and some melon. Also creamy vanilla, malt, bread, floral hops and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, excellent balance and drinkability, juicy and flavorful. Nice and creamy. Smooth sticky soft mouthfeel with very nice carbonation. A real pleasure."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.27,"Nice light fluffy pale ale. I love this line of pale ales in general, with the DDH being the best variant. Maybe due to having the DDH version first, I really expected too much of this. Full disclosure, this is very good. One of the best pale ales I've had, and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller ABV, and I do love galaxy hops - but this doesn't stand up to the DDH Fort Point."

Taste is soft, fruity, little bit of grassy bitterness. Pineapple, guava, some citrus, tad of passion fruit. Lovely Galaxy, yum beer."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.72,"Pours a hazy orange with thick, fluffy head.

Smell is juicy and clean with notes of mango, pineapple, oranges and orange sorbet.

Taste is juicy and soft with notes of mango, peach, pineapple, citrus and a floral hint. Soft, but distinct bitterness and remarkable balance. Some sweetness on the finish.

Mouthfeel is perfect, soft, pillowy and well carbonated.

Overall, a truly outstanding beer, regardless of it being an APA or IPA."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.33,"Looks and smells gorgeous. Lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose. The mouthfeel is also good though the taste flavors are more on the grapefruit than citrus side. Personally, I liked it because it does make for a more balanced and complex beer.

I was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery. It just lacked something to make it a memorable beer. The dry hopping with Galaxy was pretty good but could be better. You could tell that the base beer (Fort Point) was awesome and saved the day."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.52,Canned on 10/05/2020. Enjoyed on 10/23/2020.
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,3.96,"L: Hazy yellow with a thick head and great lacing.

S: Pine resin, a touch of cheese, diesel, pineapple, juicy fruit. A candylike malt aroma as well.

T: Mild bitterness, big juicy hop flavors of tropical fruit, peach, and pine. The malt has a candylike flavor that reinforces the hop flavors.

F: Medium/full body, lowish carb, very Lush.

Overall: A really good beer that is just a little short of being great due to some off notes from the hops. I get a bit of staleness that is not due to the beers age (canned two weeks ago), but other than that it is really great."
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,4.35,"Picked up cans fresh from the taproom, packaged 2/19/20 (just over a week old).

Looks opaque, milky yellow with a frothy white head.
Lots of hop aromas and flavors. Full and bursting with tropical fruit and citrus pulp character. Clear and direct, not a complex beer but the hops are full and strong.
Feels medium body, soft carbonation and juicy with little to no bitterness.

Overall really excellent. Glad I could pick some up!

I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp. It really should be qualified as a NE IPA but the brewery calls it a pale ale. I suppose the base beer without the double dry hop might be a little crisper, but still..."
Milk Stout,4.58,"Look: It may just be me, but, I think stouts are always the best looking beers so it’s always gonna be a 5

Smell: Chocolate, coffee, smells like one of those Starbucks nitro shot things

Taste: Like a mocha coffee, sweet, this is one of the best tasting beers. But he warned, it’s very sweet

Feel: Lingers a bit too long imo, but still very nice

Overall: This is a damn good stout. I’m so glad my local liquor store has this. Highly recommend."
Milk Stout,3.75,"I went to college in Boulder, and I don’t understand why this is so popular, but it’s cool. Became the standard for normal milk stout."
Milk Stout,4.07,"I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes, but still provided moderate lacing. The aroma is quite pleasant. chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, milk, and a vanilla-like sweetness prevail. The resultant effect bears a faint barrel-aged resemblance. The taste is about what you expect from the nose. The roasted barley blends well with moderate hops, and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. I expected a stickier consistency, but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing, compared to a typical stout. I find Left Hand Milk Stout a compelling choice among dark, sweet stouts on the market, and The 6% ABV is right on target for what I desired from this brew."
Milk Stout,4.5,"Nothing about the look and smell really stands out as a major pro or con. Where it excels is taste and feel as it really lends itself to my personal preferences. I don’t like overly fizzy beers and this stout is about as watery as they come, while still maintaining a coffee and milk flavor (tastes like a plain latte)."
Milk Stout,4,"From a bottle, pours black and opaque with a thin khaki head. Roasted mast aroma. Sweet malt, creamy caramel, chocolate, and coffee flavors. Full mouthfeel and lasting, nice!"
Milk Stout,3.44,"Roasty and smooth, but a touch too sweet for me. Definitely not a session beer."
Milk Stout,4.33,"Really good is the correct rating.
Good taste.
Sweeter than Guinness.
My highest rating so far on BA. I know that’s not saying a lot but still, impresses."
Milk Stout,4.5,"My go-to Milk Stout. Perfect smooth taste and feel. Consistent head, mellow smell."
Milk Stout,4.07,A really solid milk stout. Kind of what you expect.
Milk Stout,3.77,"I bought a glass bottle of this at my local liquor store and drank it from a shaker pint. I found it to be dry for a milk stout, which is generally fine by me as I'm not a huge fan of sweetness in beer. I thought it tasted more of fig than coffee or chocolate. I'd definitely drink it again."
Milk Stout,4,I prefer other American stouts but this at least met expectations and I'd absolutely have this again. The flavors are there I just know you can find them in other places more intensely. Definitely worth a try especially if new to the style
Milk Stout,3.87,Chocolate and coffee with nice malt flavor
Milk Stout,3.75,"2. rerate, 355 ml bottle, as Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.0%. Black colour, low and creamy beige head. Dryish roasty aroma, notes of coffee, hints of woodwork, cocoa and liquorice. Low carbonation. Medium dry and very roasty flavour with a little lactose sweetness present, notes of strong coffee, a little dark chocolate and liquorice. Should not be drunk ice cold, cellar temperature is better. 1. rerate, 12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway (forgot that I had rated it previously). ABV was said to be 5.0%. Dark brown colour, nearly black, nice and lasting tan head. Notes of aroma: same as first time. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The flavour has still plenty of roasted malts and lactose sweetness, also notes of chocolate, mild coffee and some liquorice. Good stuff - I’m upping it a few points. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Dark brown to black colour. Nice roasty aroma, notes of cocoa, hints of liquorice. Moderately sweet flavour, plenty of maltiness (probably also lactose)."
Milk Stout,4.04,"12 oz bottle poured into a stout glass. Pours black, opaque with a tan head that falls to a cap. Smell is coffee, cocoa, roast malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, coffee and cream on entry. Middle is where sweet gets evened out as hop bitterness creeps in. You get a bit of earthiness from the hops too, but again, everything is well balanced. Finish is roast, nuts, and a bit of cocoa. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Low, tight carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer with a ton of flavor that drinks easy."
Milk Stout,4,A really good stout
Milk Stout,3.85,"Appearance: Pours a nearly completely black color with a soft, tan head. SRM of 24. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of chocolate and cream upfront. There is also a velvety, cherry, and licorice note. Not much coffee or roast. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of velvety, rich chocolate, There are some underlying red velvet and red & black cherry notes here too. Mild roast and minimal coffee here. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Minimal bitterness and roast so allows it to lean malty. (3.75)

Compared to Firestone Walker's Nitro Merlin Milk Stout 1/10/21: Pours a similar color with a darker head. More cherry licorice on the aroma. Less coffee roast. Maybe slightly less bitterrness from the roast, but since it's not nitro doesn't feel as smooth. I mislabeled the two in a blind taste test.

Overall: A pretty nice and easy drinking milk stout. I get some hints of red velvet, cherry, licorice. But overall minimal coffee and roast here. Appropriate sweetness, but the minimal roast allows it to finish slightly malty and fairly easy-drinking at 6%. (Final Rating: 3.85, the flavor helps it here with the rich cherry-chocolate flavor)"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.63,"I tried it for the first time and love it. It tastes like Budweiser but it goes down smooth w/o competition from its ingredients. It don't taste watered down like some beers nor does it taste like horse piss haha.

I can't comment on look as I always drink straight outta the bottle - cans included.

Smell - smells like it tastes. Bold in character, you can tell alot thru smell, if its pleasing to the nose, its pleasing to the palate. Which this is both ways."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.98,"Guinness is where it all started for me. In a world where the challenge was to quaff Genessee Beer until my friends deposited me on my parents’ doorstep and rang the bell, I was introduced to Guinness by an Irish man. He said ‘if you’re going to drink beer, drink Good Beer’. I never forgot that.,.

The One that started my never ending search for Better Stout, I think of Guinness every time.
Familiar, roasty, toasty, just the right amount if carbonation, nice aroma, and, they say, it’s Good For Me.
I’ll have another, please.,."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.89,"Dark and slightly roasted with hints of chocolate and coffee. Bittersweet and pleasant. I know that the mouthfeel is different when it’s poured from a draft as opposed to straight out of the bottle, but I kinda wanted a little more carbonation. However, it is silky smooth and easy to enjoy."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.77,"Black in color with minimal light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering most of the top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark roasted malt and a hint of smoke. I’m tasting dark roasted malt, toasted nuts, and just a suggestion of smoke. The mouth is lightly sticky, chewy, and dry."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.45,"I wonder sometimes what people expect in a beer. I have plenty of friends that drink Coors Light 24/7-365. They must have a corn fetish? Personally I hate ""corn water"". I only concede any ground when the thermometer goes north of 95-degrees and then I'll take a Corona, Victoria, or Modelo...keep the twist thank you. To get to the point I think ""real"" beer should be somewhat complex and accessible. That's what Guiness Extra Stout is. The world's most popular non-alcoholic beverages would include coffee, tea, and cola and it's no mistake that Guiness has elements of all of these universally adored drinks. The complexity comes from the combination of malted grain sugars in the right naturally carbonated mix. Extra Stout has it and regular draught, to me, doesn't even if it has ten nitro balls. Extra Stout has the ""correct"" mouth feel which is refreshing and clean. Extra Stout has the balance of chocolates, coffees, dates, and bitters. It's almost a miracle a rather full and heavy beer is so refreshing and drinkable. Like a great steak there will come a point where enough is enough and more would be an insult. Even so I can drink a whole sixer of this rather full-bodied brew though I'd probably stop at around three or four mostly. I think this may be the world's best beer. Just an opinion like something else. LOL."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.38,"Refreshing, toasty and bitter at the same time. It has a strong baking cocoa kind of flavor and a pleasantly bitter char/smoke aftertaste, but the finish is crisp and clean, it's not heavy like I would have expected. Guinness is hit or miss for me but I really like this one!"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.87,"Guinness Extra Stout is in a class by itself. It's heavy and refreshingly light at the same time. It's not cloyingly thick, but clean. It has a wonderful roasted flavor--almost burnt--but not quite. I would say it has an almost dark chocolate sense about it.
On a cold winter day, this would be a great choice while sitting by the fire."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.95,"22 ounce bottle poured into a nonic style pint glass.

Blacking out the pint with root beer brown edges and two inches of mocha foam. The head has good retention and leaves plenty of lace. Nose is malt forward and roasty with a subtle sweet fruit and chocolate aroma. Tasting roasty, medium bitter and fairly dry with a lasting bitter finish. Medium bodied with high-ish carbonation giving some bite to a mostly smooth drink. Always a solid option."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.64,"Look - 11.2 fl oz bottle, poured into a Guinness pint glass. dark brown in color, but transparent if you shine a light through it. big foamy three finger head with moderate retention and a lot of lacing.

Smell - some coffee, less dark chocolate, and heavily roasted malts. smells nice and hearty.

Taste - mild coffee-esque bitterness hits the tongue first, followed by light sweetness. black coffee flavor lingers in the finish, which is dry.

Feel - medium bodied, high carbonation, and a bit more boozy than the typical Irish stout at 5.6%.

Overall - relative to Guinness draught, this one is a bit more rough on the edges and packs a slight more punch, both of which I prefer. Happy St. Patrick's Day!"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),5,Totally loved it! Like coffee with vanilla ice cream cheers! Happy St. Patrick’s Day everyone!
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.75,Basically the Guinness I had as a teen/20-something before really getting into beer... Black in the glass beneath a fat tan head in a proprietary Guinness pint... Roasty and toasty and dry - very little sweetness - smooth and amply carbonated with a bittersweet char on the finish...
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.93,"11.2 oz bottle stamped L1327
Ebony with ruby highlights on the edges. Two fingers varied tan head, full curtains lacing. Full cap reduces to large bubbles and full ring.
Distinct roast malt, cocoa, vanilla, light coffee aromas.
Light char and hops, mocha, brown bready flavors.
Smooth but with light hop spike. Drinkable with good carbonation.
Good quality at a good price, and doesn’t sit on the shelves for years."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.29,"Back label code L1284 G0002, “1284” appears to be a Julian date. 284th day of 2021 would be roughly September 2021, consumed at 4 months old. That’s just my educated guess, no clear date is printed.

Dark brown tone, ample foam and sheets of lacing. Lasting surface coverage for the duration of the glass. Mild grainy aroma, very mild roast.

Unfortunately there were some acidity, papery oxidation, and oddly lactic notes. Mild raisin, vague roast and bitterness, not assertive or very flavorful. Fairly smooth, soft carbonation, lightly medium bodied.

A simple, bland stout, easy to drink. Not something i’ll seek out again, unless it’s any port in a storm situation."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.56,"Look: Poured straight from a 11.2 oz bottle. Dark black pour - one of the darkest pours I've seen. Midnight black. A bit of foam depending the way you pour. Some lacing is hanging. quite like hanging Christmas lights up.
Smell: Smells of Chocolate, malts, coffee, maybe even a metallic smell as well.
Taste: Getting notes of stronger coffee even though the coffee isn't very strong compared to imperials - with some light chocolate. Light but noticable. Some malts as well.
Feel: Light bodied drink. Extremely easy to drink. smooth going down - almost can sip this as easily as water.
Overall: Not bad! This beer is world known and I'm glad to have given a review about my experience with it. If you follow what I've said just know this beer is great and definitely worth the try."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.82,"Cooked up some Irish stew for dinner. Not super traditional, as I had no mutton so I subbed in beef and I also added carrots with the onion and potatoes, but either way it was absolutely delicious. Had some garlic bread too. Decided only a Guinness could go with this meal!

The look is gorgeous in the pint glass. It pours a roasted dark brown/almost black colour, compared to the ruby-ish lighter colour of the draught. Not nitro, so the head is tan/off-white, and lasts about 4-5 minutes but the lacing is good.

Smell was the most underwhelming aspect of this beer. It’s fairly classic, dark roast malts and a strong coffee aroma. But the taste is where it truly shines.

Stouts are my first and truest love, so I’ll be honest. Not sure if I got the freshest, best batch in the world or if other reviews are off, but this was phenomenal. It tastes incredibly roasted, almost slightly burnt at times, malty mocha savoury notes, very creamy, perfect amount of carbonation. Lasts very long in the tongue and mouth, exhaling toasty bready barley notes through your nose. Definitely more bitter than the draught, but not excessively so, the bitterness comes from the darkly roasted malt notes rather than a hoppy bitterness. The last notes after a sip, after they dissipate, is a light and sweet malt in the front of the tongue with mild toasty character in the back.

The benchmark for stouts, in my opinion! It’s somewhat straightforward compared to some others out there, but that’s okay. It’s classic Guinness flavour, doing what it does best, and I was absolutely floored by how good it was. Like I said, either I got a super fresh batch or something magical happened, but this was phenomenal!"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.78,"Guinness' are so distinctive, pitch black with a creamy head

Sweet aromas of cocoa and cream and rich flavors of barley malt, black cherry and mocha ending with a semi-sweet dry finish

Medium body mouthfeel compared to other Guinness' of the world

Quite refreshing clocking in at 5.6% ABV"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.98,"Drinking it out of the bottle. Good taste, not as flat as the draft of the same. Way better than IPAs. Continuing my quest to find the perfect beer, it’s a snipe hunt, but journey is entertaining. Next stop is Pilsner Urquell. You should see the crazy selection at the tiny grocery up street in small town. Crazy selection. Like the 5.3 % alcohol.

This is probably not a summer day beer. But great in winter. Cheers!"
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),3.86,"Poured from 11.2oz glass bottle
The look is fantastically dark doesnt let any light through. A tan head that's fine on top bit through the glass the bubbles look larger farther down. This is a traditional CO2 brew only draught is nitro. But the head retention is epic and leaves a layer of foamy head even after sitting for over 15 minutes of slow drinking (and forgetting about it) heavy heavy lacing.

The smell is rich with vanilla and roasty bitterness, maybe some light coffee notes. The fermentation character is present but subtle and there is a light tartness on the nose. Overall creamy and sweet smelling though.

Flavor mostly follows the smell but with more almost savory roasty notes from the malt very smooth and enjoyable, but not very sweet as should be expected from guiness. Some bitterness from the hops bit nothing major just offering balance. Some of that fermentation character does come through slightly as well but not very noticeable. Almost too easy to drink bit very enjoyable.

Feel is creamy yet smooth and very easy to put down not watery and is a bit thick but still quite drinkable. If it came in cans you might be able to shotgun it (but it doesnt) quite a lot of flavor for that though.

Overall a good everyday stout that gives you more than a macro but not to much to be something you cant put down at a party or offend peoples tastebuds with something unfamiliar."
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),4.16,Intangibles are off the charts craft beer should win hands down but as a change of pace beer this is real nice.
Old Engine Oil,4.11,"Nearly jet black body with a huge pillowy head. Smell is faint and sweet; cola, a hint of grassy hops, a bit nutty. Taste is upfront cola, then burnt bread and a hint of cacao, then a pronounced leather on the finish with black coffee notes. Feel is creamy and smooth. It’s damn nice to have a bitter beer that relies on malt rather than hops these days."
Old Engine Oil,3.94,Tasty and a bit unusual.
Old Engine Oil,2.74,"Roasted malt, a little coffe, a little bitter. Creamy yet pretty easy-going. Not impressive yet quite enjoyable."
Old Engine Oil,4.26,"Pours near black from the can, big 3"" foamy tan head that slowly dissipates, moderate lacing. Nose is baking chocolate, blackstrap molasses, Australian black licorice, loose change. Taste is roasted, bitter dark chocolate, no remaining sweetness or sugar. Finish is ultra dry and bitter with just a small touch of heat as it warms. Mouthfeel pleasantly full with very slight carbonation. Overall, an excellent, clean stout."
Old Engine Oil,4.33,"L: solid pitch black with a slight khaki head.
S: dark roast coffee, chocolate, malt, molasses, and maple syrup
T: black coffee, chocolate, bitter, and malt
F: nice, fine carbonation

Overall, an excellent black ale."
Old Engine Oil,4.29,Excellent smoky and toast flavor with great malts.
Old Engine Oil,4.45,"These are observations after a clear pint glass filled from a tap was presented. It's a dark brown colored affair, but not black coffee brown, just dark brown. It really is a lovely soft dark brown. There's a tan head that's not overstaying its welcome. The aroma is of roasted malt, not overly roasted, with hints of toffee and a latte styled coffee. Even before the taste can be appreciated, the wonderfully smooth and rich body hits the drinker. It's full bodied and although never sweet, only turns bitter during the finish. That sensation is a combination of the roasting of the malt, the hops and a hint of the alcohol. The glass lacing is notably sparse for a brew with such a rich body, but so what?, since drinking isn't meant for the eyes. This is unmistakably outstanding."
Old Engine Oil,4.1,"12oz can poured into a tulip

A- pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge

S- black roasted malts, black licorice, anise, char, coffee, oats, spicy and floral hops

T- roasted barely up front gives notes of char and coffee, followed by floral and peppery hops. Mid-palate gives sharp black licorice. The finish is bitter, with dark chocolate and black licorice on the linger

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish

O- classic English porter, well done"
Old Engine Oil,3.82,"Look: Looks like a stout, pitch black pour, light brown head that melted to a thin ring around the glass. Medium Lace on the sides.
Smell and Taste: Rich dark chocolate is the dominate note with toasted malts and toffee.
Feel: Maybe the name is suggestive but I'd say oily. LOL
Overall: This brew is somewhat confusing to me. It's kinda stouty, if that's a word, kanda like a strong ale, kinda like a Scottish ale. ????"
Old Engine Oil,4.35,"L. Dark brown/black, poured from a 330 ml bottle. Modest tan head. S. Slightly pungent, malty, dark grain. T. This is where it's at. Wow. Great intense, dark malt, molasses, a hint of licorice. Dry finish, very little sweetness. F. Slightly oily, smooth and a touch thick. O. Very impressive, intense and big beer that deserves its reputation."
Old Engine Oil,3.9,"On tap at Lost Nation. Black body. Smells of intense roasted malt. Licorice and molasses. Tastes of intense roasted malt here too. Licorice, bitter chocolate, molasses, but no sweetness. Very bitter back end. Medium body. Excellent."
Old Engine Oil,4.12,"Pours ebony with a 2 "" foamy tan head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.

Aroma of coffee, roast malt, black malt.

Taste is coffee, roast malt, black malt, chocolate. Astringent.

Full bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

Thick as engine oil and very tasty!"
Old Engine Oil,4.18,"Prompted by the Beers of Fame thread, and realizing I'd had many of them in the past, but never reviewed them, I dug out an old notebook from the 2004 Chicago Real Ale festival where I took some detailed notes of some of the early examples I sampled.

I was able to enjoy this one at Chicago's Map Room from a cask -- whether or not it was truly CC, I can't say. Maybe my notes will be revealing.

A -- Dark, opaque black.

S -- Black Patent roasted malts and licorice. Yeasty nose and alcohol with warming.

T -- Rich, roasted malt flavor.

F -- Medium to robust body with a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel.

O -- Very flavorful beer. I had enjoyed this from bottles a few times prior, but the cask pour was quite nice -- and memorable after so long."
Old Engine Oil,4.17,"Right up their with its ""big brother"" the Engineers Reserve this is a delicious porter. A wonderful blend of bakers chocolate, coffee grounds, bit of charred gristle etc..."
Old Engine Oil,4.73,"This one pours a lovely dark mahogany brown color. Completely opaque. A two finger velvety mocha colored head forms on the beer and lingers for a while before slowly and almost imperceptibly dissipating until just a thin layer of foam remains on top of the beer. Its pretty much a perfect looking porter. The aroma on this is remarkably complex with notes of chocolate, toffee, with a certain hint of creaminess coming through. Then, there are the roasted malts that have a mild smokiness to them. Finally there are some light earthy hoppy notes that come through on the nose.

The flavor follows the nose with notes of chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, a light smokiness, and an earthy hop presence on the back end. There is a certain sweet creaminess to the beer. Its one of those beers that gives you something else to ponder every sip - at first I notice the creamy sweetness and chocolate notes, then on the next sip, Im drawn to the earthy hoppy bitterness, and then again the smokiness and roasted malts seem to take over. The resulting effect is one of a remarkably complex beer that requires your undivided attention to truly and fully appreciate it. The feel is smooth and silky. Moderate to medium bodied. Spritzy carbonation provides a certain liveliness to the beer. The finish is drier and somewhat powdery.

Overall this is an absolutely delightful beer that for me a least hits everything I want from a porter."
Old Engine Oil,4.25,"A - Black pour (go figure, right?). Creamy, soapy, dense caramel colored head on top that sticks to the glass.

S - Chocolate and chocolate roast dominate the nose with a slight bit of coffee roast. Smells like a glass full of chocolate roast.

T - Chocolate, chocolate roast, char, coffee bean, and more char. (!!!) The chocolate roast and char lingers for days well after the sip.

M - Viscous big medium body and dry on the back of the tongue.

O - This is a fantastic Porter, highly recommended."
Old Engine Oil,3.98,Black color. Foamy lingering 1-finger white head. Enjoyable roasted malt flavor with just a touch of sweetness and notes of espresso and leather. Mouthfeel is very silky but not overbearingly heavy. Everything is pretty well balanced.
Old Engine Oil,4.39,"I finally found it! This brew has been on my wants list since 2013! (Specifically added just after my wedding day) 330 ml can served at cellar temperature into a tulip. LCBO purchase for $3.25 CDN.

Appearance - Very dark brown and near black in color. Huge swath of many fingers of head is poured, leaving a huge curtain of lacing. Great staying power of the light tan head. The body does in fact look like old engine oil.

Smell - Roasty notes, a touch of chocolate, but mainly more earthy, leathery with a tobacco or smokey hint. Molasses also seems prevalent. Fantastic nose and clearly a leafy hop assertiveness backing everything up.

Taste - Quintessentially British Isles in style. Earthy and bitter leafy hops, some overroasted grain leaving for a rich and bitter flavor. Loads of leather, some molasses and just enough smoke.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, leaning heavy with some carbonation, but super slick, velvety feel, yet never heavy like a bigger stout would be. Wonderfully balanced.

Overall - Love this brew. Lived up to my expectations and then some. Remarkably easy drinking, tons of flavor, Scottish flair, the name even describes the beer almost perfectly. One of the beers of the year for me and it's early. To me at least Old Engine Oil is to English Porter as Weihanstephaner Hefeweissbeier is to hefeweizens as Duvel is to Strong Belgian Pale Ales, as La Fin Du Monde is to tripels as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is to APA's. The distinctive beer of the style that all others try to replicate."
Old Engine Oil,4.26,"Old Engine Oil fills my glass true to its name. It pours into my glass as black and thick as motor oil, throwing a cream filled coffee colored head with great retention.
Taking a sniff, the first thing I smell is coffee, supported quickly by dark, European chocolate. Malts make their presence known in the form of rye bread, hot and fresh from the oven. Below that are hints of nuttiness and a general earthy aroma. Each aroma leads smoothly, from one to the next, giving a rich, lush, seamless porter. All of this leads to a coffee scented aroma combined with earthy, leafy hops.
That first sip of Old English Oil shows me a porter that is full bodied, lush, and full flavored without being overpowering in its dark, roasty flavors. Old Engine Oil’s flavor is slightly more coffeeish than the aroma, giving slightly stronger flavors of dark, black, roasted coffee. Belgian chocolate and dark bread lend structure to the beer’s flavor profile. All this leads into a bitter finish full of dark roasted coffee.
It’s delicious, complex, and robust, without being overpowering in its flavors of roasted coffee. The flavors walk the line between flavor and overpowering complexity very deftly, making it a drinkable, approachable example of the style. In my opinion, it would be very easy for a porter to venture too far into the flavors of roasted coffee, making it hard to drink."
Old Engine Oil,3.36,"Pours black with a thick beige head. The smell is roasted malts and molasses. The taste is more bitter than I’ve come to expect for a stout. The toasty-ness I’m familiar with is present. A bit smokey. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, not watery, but thin.

Old Engine Oil,4.21,"Solid black appearance with about an average body. Medium light carbonation and an almost dry feel
...aroma is coffee grinds, black coffee,dark bakers chocolate roasted malt, bitter black coffee
.. taste is,bitter,black coffee bitter,dark chocolate bitter,did I mention bitter?. Roasted malt, coffee beans, dark fruit and an odd saltiness in the aftertaste.
.. this won't work for everyone but if in the mood then this is an excellent, very flavorful beer. Glad I tried it and would look for it again."
Old Engine Oil,4.12,"355 mL can from the LCBO; best before Aug 2021 and served barely chilled. Seems like a good night to finally tick off one of the oldest items on my ""wants"" list.... yet both the label and the Harviestoun website now describe this as a ""craft stout"" rather than a porter.

Pours a dark, black-chestnut brown colour with ruby red highlights, producing one finger of smooth, foamy, cream-coloured head that seeps away within two minutes or so. A creamy-looking collar is the main remnant; a few wisps on the surface also remain, but there's minimal lace. It smells of roasted grain, dark chocolate and coffee grounds, with additional hints of treacle, figgy dark fruit, earthy hops and a touch of smoke.

A tasty, flavourful stout - there's molasses, roasted grains and chocolate at the forefront, with hints of date and black cherry not far behind. Notes of coffee and baker's chocolate develop later on, alongside an earthy, woodsy finish with suggestions of thyme and floral hops; roasty aftertaste with lingering spice & earthiness. Medium in body, with moderately low carbonation levels that gently prickle the palate, lending a little bit of liveliness to this brew's mostly smooth mouthfeel. No sign of the 6% at all, really, which makes it more drinkable than it probably should be - I could easily plow through several of these short cans over the course of an evening.

Final Grade: 4.12, a an A-. Harviestoun's Old Engine Oil is one of the better English stouts (/stout porters?) that I've had over the years. It's not necessarily a world-beater, but it delivers everything I expect from this type of beer with skill and finesse, all in a neat, flavourful little package. A very nice way to ring in a brand new year - one which, barring an asteroid strike or nuclear war, couldn't possibly be any worse than the last one... right? (He asked nervously?)"

AROMA - light, very refined barnyard, low tartness, quite restrained

FLAVOR - light notes of rose and ginger, clover, low background horse blanket, slight mineral finish

OVERALL - Sublime. Super cohesive, aging mellows this beer quite a bit"
Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.31,2011
Lou Pepe - Gueuze,4.08,"January 1st, 2016 - Also kicking off 2016 is a beer from almost a decade ago: the 2007 Cantillon Lou Pepe. Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick. Absolutely fascinating, and delicious, this has aged quite wonderfully."
Appervation,4.9,"#78, yummy!"
Appervation,4.27,"Straight chilling. Nothing crazy like Chief breaking out of the booby hatch, but I can straight just chill on this thing like on a hammock on sunny day. And that’s it, this beer is Raul on a hammock; not on a beach or in the top of Mount Everest, just a hammock.

Be well, my children."

S - bourbon, chocolate, molasses, roasted malt
T - bourbon, chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, molasses
F - thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O - outstanding beer, a quintessential BBA stout"
Appervation,4.61,"Sampling a cellar temp 500 ml bottle poured into my snifter. 2020 vintage.
The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!
The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.
Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.
First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.
Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.
I am really enjoying this beer and find it a pleasure to drink, highly recommend this to the BBA stout crowd."
Appervation,4.69,Just a wonderful collab. The 2020 is great without any further aging.
Appervation,4.75,Such an outstanding non-adjunct BBA stout
Appervation,4.49,"2020 vintage. Beer pours black with brown foam. Smells like chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The taste stays around quite long, quite some roast and coffee present. The body is just a little thin, but overall a very nice beer."

S: Aroma is tart, super funky, fruity esters. Decent amount of grape, belgium-yeast-like bubblum, subtle oak, and decent sourness. 4

T: Taste is quite good. Wine-like vinous notes, pretty tart and sour, oaky and dry on the finish. Subtle funk, with plastic notes. No real pungent funk characters which is ok with me. Some sweet, fruity notes to balance. Very nice. 4.25

Cuvée De Castleton,3.59,"poured pale yellow with little head, but then i perhaps poured out too much from the bottom of the bottle and now it looks opaque.

smell is funk and grape and sour cider. not in love with the aroma per se, but for what the beer is, it's pretty much spot on.

i dunno. if i wanted wine, i would have signed up for wine advocate. flavor is nice - quite sharp and sour up front but the aftertaste mellows it out. i'm missing the spice here and the oak is more woody than barrel.

mouth is leaving me wanting something to clean my palate.

i like sours. i like brett. something about this one just doesn't do it for me."
Cuvée De Castleton,4,"2015 vintage served cold in a teku

Appearance: bright and clear gold with no head at all. Very low carbonation. Bottle presentation is very nice however the cage that secured the cork fell apart after only 1/2 a turn on opening. I've found this true with other CL sours. Possibly a QA issue with packaging or a product defect.

Nose: Brett funk, sweet grape juice, vinous, very complex, strong Barrel character

Taste: sharp acid here. Quite sour initially. The barrel character is strong with a ton of tannins. This drinks like a full bodied white wine with very little sweetness. The ""beer"" qualities are very understated. There is a significant astringency to the beer as well. Not a bad thing per say and it does add complexity, just wasn't expecting it. The wine barrel and vinious characters are the centerpiece here. Extremely low carbonation. Very nice sour.

Overall: this one shocked me. It completely straddles the line between beer and wine. I can decide if Scott Vaccaro is a mad genius or just crazy. Either way this was a delightful beer."
Crème Brûlée,4,"Poured into a chalice: color is black, head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour.

Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast.

Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor.

Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength.

Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque)."
Crème Brûlée,3.84,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet."
Crème Brûlée,4.62,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer."
Crème Brûlée,4.05,"650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!"
Crème Brûlée,4.45,"Looks: At 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. LOL. Nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. Great lacing on the glass. Smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom.
Smell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination.
Feel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft.
Overall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. At least it would have come closer to filling my glass. I would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink, like desert."
Crème Brûlée,4,Sweet and choclaty to the nose. Sweet chocolate taste with a vanilla finish. Great dessert beer.
Crème Brûlée,3.83,"Pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head, 1/4” cap was present for the duration.

Nose is seriously sweet with caramel, brown sugar, sweet cream and vanilla bean.

Flavor begins with caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.

Finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.

Viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising.

Not a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though."
Crème Brûlée,4.34,"Pours quite dark and fairly clear, appropriate head. Aroma is dark roasted malts and vanilla. Actually tastes like a creme brûlée - complete with the sugary vanilla and the burnt sugar on the finish. Nicely done. Carbonation is appropriate. Obverse a nicely crafted beer, hits all the marks.

Crème Brûlée,2.21,"The initial smell is quite nice. But then you take a sip. Utterly disgusting. I tried a second can, same. The sheer number of positive reviews required me to sign up and leave a review. I'm still trying to get the after taste out of my mouth. Absolutely do not recommend."
Crème Brûlée,4,Pours dark. Tan head. Syrupy sweet aroma. Tastes like a mixed drink. Malty sweet body. Creamy alcohol finish. A good desert beer.
Crème Brûlée,1,"I wish I could give these folks a ZERO but its not an option. The Creme Brûlée beers were over pressurized and for the first 3 packs of 4 beers, I opened them over the sink as they would fizz on opening. The beer was in an area with no sun and a constant 69 degrees. A few days ago 3 beers of a four pack exploded. The tops pushed up and blew off. One top severed completely where the flat and round part of the can connect. Two of those cans shot 20 feet into my home spraying beer as they traveled. The third shot upwards to the ceiling. It was a 5 hour clean up job and we are still finding areas we missed and hand washing items that had to be rack dried to remove stale, very sugary, beer. Calling friends, family and my boss to tell them to remove the gifted beer from their home was amusing. The manager where I bought them said Southern Tier had other recalls on their nitros for the same reason so BUYER BEWARE. I called the company and left a message for quality control to call me. That was three days ago and nothing. Clearly Southern Tier does not care about customer service or their customers experience with their product. Had they called back to discuss the issue I would continue to buy their beer. Instead, they have lost a customer for life. There are just too many other good brews out there that I can try instead."
Crème Brûlée,4.02,"Poured from the tap at Oak & Stone in Sarasota, FL. Loved the ABV (10%) but way too over-the-top sweet. You know, like that dessert you bite into and your teeth hurt. I was expecting a dessert kind of drink but wow."
Crème Brûlée,3.81,"(9.6/12 oz nitro can, D. O. B. 10/24/19; purchased cold single at Shangy's.... poured into a fat tulip)

L: deep, dark brown, seemingly-murky liquid; fantastically-tight, tan, creamy foam...

S: horribly, pied-piper-ly, artificially, caramel-vanilla latte ice cream-scented candle smell - super, stupid potent, but rather Coffee-Mate quality (I recently reviewed a beer where the CM fakery was well-nigh suffocating; this may have usurped its ugly stranglehold)...

T: rather artificial, fake flavor renderings; coffee, creme, vanilla wafer... this ain't beer... an alcoholic (and deceptively so) Young's Double Choco Stout (or that barely-palatable Wells Sticky Toffee crud) violently-injected with vanilla Coffee Mate and pungent piney shrubs... mellow roasty, near-tannic bitterness lingering long

F: unsurprisingly satiny-smooth, quiet caress... mellow spicy booze activity, silky sedation in its finish... admittedly easy to slug (destroy), heaven forbid one has this at a bar while socializ-ising - too dangerously slammable

O: mercifully, my last review of the day (and I haven't yet weighed in on any of the 12 4 oz tasters at Weyerbacher midday)... had this years ago in a bomber (and/or on tap?!), but got mad confused review-wise as to whether or not I'd done it, eh?... insanely full-flavored - and of a quality of which I most nostalgically associate with Southern Tier... gotta 3- or 4-way share even a small can of this, good god (1620)"
Crème Brûlée,4.35,"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle in to a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brow, almost black color with a tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured. Head settles eventually to a pretty thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with some nice cluster swirls of film layer of foam on the beer's surface with good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars for a bit of additional sweetness. A very decadent chocolate flavor here indeed. Has a crisp, slightly oily, also smooth and creamy, full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and slightly dry aftertaste. An excellent beer all around.

Crème Brûlée,4.6,"This is delicious. Pours black with barely any dark tan head. Smells of vanilla, cherries, plums. Taste is sweet malt, vanilla and dark fruit. No bitterness at all. Very much a dessert beer."
Framboise Du Fermier,4.45,"750 ml bottle, poured into a New Glarus glass at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours a clear bright ruby-garnet red, at least for the first pour. Forms a thin, fizzy, short-lived white head that swiftly dies to a ring.

S: The nose is all tart raspberries, with some soft oak tannins wafting in the backdrop.

T: Sharp, tart, sour raspberries, with just a slight tang beneath of oak.

F: Light, and not terribly lively.

O: Definitely framboise to the core, with a du Fermier acidity."

Overall - just fantastic and super tartness with a ton of raspberry"
Framboise Du Fermier,4.61,"Pours a dull, matte pink that resembles the fresh of grapefruit. No foam on this bottle pour. Pour is from the bottom 1/3 of the bottle. Aroma is strong raspberry (had it all caps in my notes). Stone and grass add depth, before a tart finish dries out the nose and cues a sip. Flavor profile is raspberries through and through. Stone, grass, and grapefruit round out each sip. It's sweet, then tart. Mouth feel is creamy with a mild silt throughout. Thickness is medium-thick, coming in on the more full side of saisons. Overall, a plump, ripe saison jammed up and full of raspberries.

Bottle pour. Reviewed from notes."
Framboise Du Fermier,4.6,"750 ml bottle today. Poured a deep and dark ruby color. Beautiful beer in the glass. Instant aroma of raspberries. Very fragrant. Smells fruity and tart. Flavor was full of raspberry with some acidity and a hint of vinegar. A real treat though. Great body for the style. Good carb too. Overall, outstanding iteration of a fruited saison. Took a long time for me to track this one down and would do it again."
Framboise Du Fermier,4.15,Bottle. Garnet pour with a white head. Big raspberry bouquet. Tasty with loads of raspberry highlights. Nice caramel malt and oak backbeats. Good body and mouthfeel.
Framboise Du Fermier,5,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark red hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of raspberry, love it.

Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.63,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 9.5%. Pitch black colour, creamy brown head.

Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.25,"Bottle review.

Pitch black; no light shall pass.

Nice dark tan head; thick lacing.

Smells of a delicious mocha latte; hint of booze. Enticing.

Thick, heavy mouthfeel.

Dark chocolate slaps you in the mouth on the first sip; coffee hits you on the back end.

This feels and tastes like a delicious chocolate malt. One of a kind."
Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.5,"Still love this beer. First had in 2016 from the bottle (4.75*), then in 2017 (4.5*), then a 2016 in 2018 (3.75*). Maybe my palette has changed over the years, resulting in the lowered rating or maybe it's me aging the beer, but it's still one of my old favorites that I'll continue to buy."
Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.29,"On tap. Pours a satin black with a multi finger, tan head that lingers and leaves lacing. Nose of espresso and roasted malt. Taste follows nose with roasted malt, strong coffee, and a subtle not of chocolate to balance the roastiness. Full body and low carbonation that is absolutely velvety smooth.
Another great Yeti. Great Divide does these magnificently."
Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,3.74,"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, sipped for an hour and a half

Look - Thick motor oil black, with a beautiful milk chocolate brown half finger head. The lacing on this beer is thick, top notch.

Smell - A wonderful whisky up front, with notes of vanilla and espresso and some chocolate

Taste - A nice roasted espresso with hints of chocolate and vanilla. A suprising bitterness likely accentuated by the espresso beans helps cut the maltiness. As it warms, the espresso really comes through and takes center stage, almost too much.

Feel - This is a thick and chewy beer, definitely a nice slow sipper.

Overall - This is a good strong stout. Pretty standard in terms of big bold flavor, however I felt the bitterness was a bit too prevalent as this stout warmed. It would have been a bit more agreeable if was slightly sweeter. Still very enjoyable, no doubt."
Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,4.8,"This is one of the best coffee stouts that I ever had. This is up their with your Mikkellers, Deschutes, Avery, Founders, New Holland, Oskar Blues, & Firestone Walkers of the beer world. Due to the oak aging that coffee is going to last longer than usual which is a good thing if your sitting on a bottle that is somewhere between 6 months to 1 year old. The 6 pack of highland black mocha stout that me & friend drank was blown out of the water by this beast. This blows the others from the oak aged lineup out of the water as far as I'm concerned. This is as good as any coffee stout that I have ever had. It's a little pricey but worth every dime spent, a World Class stout for sure. Cheers! A"
Espresso Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,3.68,"Bomber into a snifter appears black in color with a khaki head. Nose is citrus pepper, earth, roast and charred grain. Taste is bitter roast, earth, citrus, coffee and tobacco. This is medium to light in body with modest carbonation. Not bad, not great."

Hazy medium straw in color with a thin bubbly white head that persists. Earthy grassy with sweet bready honey maltiness and a ton of citrus and tropical fruits. Tasty."
Saison Du Fermier,4.26,"Thank you not2quick for this one!

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F.

Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.

Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.

Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.

Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in. A top tier American oak-aged saison."
Saison Du Fermier,4.42,Such a great representation of a traditional saison
Saison Du Fermier,4.26,"Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of green apple and pear and earthy saison yeast. I’m tasting green apple and pear. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and crisp."
Saison Du Fermier,4.53,"Had on tap at SP STL pub
Amazing; super gentle
Excellent barrel, grape and muskiness"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.42,"16 oz can.

Pours a hazy pale gold color with a finger of creamy white head. Modest retention. Leaves some splotchy lacing around the glass.

The aroma is exploding with notes of pineapple, mango, stone fruit, and fresh mixed berries. There's a bit of melon, grapefruit and orange as well.

The flavor follows the nose with loads of melon, mango and pineapple, candied peach rings, blueberry, orange creamsicle, and grapefruit.

The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A little slick and oily. Alcohol is mostly well hidden.

Overall, this is an excellent NEDIPA. It takes all the best qualities of the mosaic hop and completely amplifies them. It drinks about as it should for 8.5%."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.74,"Can dated 03/03, consumed 03/26…

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.27,"Pours as a hazy yellow color with a very nice pillowy white head on top. The smell of fresh hops oozes from the glass. The taste of the beer has a great balance of sweet cream and tropical hop flavors. The feel is smooth, very easy going, highly quaffable. Overall it's a very good beer!"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.44,"Poured honey orange - completely opaque and crowned with an almost white foam head ; very nice in terms of NEIPA.
The aroma is potent; and for me that's something. Fruit forward, but instead of heavy citrus I get melon and stone fruit, maybe some light pineapple and the expected hop dankness, though I had to 'look' for it. Almost hidden.
The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory. Really tasty.
The feel is appropriate to the style and without any 'bits' that seem to be always present in hazy beers. Soft is a word that came to mind, smooth another. Not pulpy, but full bodied. Very quaff-able.
OA, a solid DNEIPA and one I would be very happy to drink on a regular basis."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.25,"Hazy golden yellow body. Nice rich tropical fruit, herbal and citrus. Slight caramel, a bit of dank and pineapple. Medium bodied, good carbonation, mild herbal bitterness on the finish. Heavy on the mosaic but in a good way."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.25,"Looks pretty good from the can for the style; pours the exact color of Gatorade citrus cooler, full 2"" had with decent retention and leaves big chunks of lacing. Nose explodes from the can with some strong diesel, resin, grapefruit juice and oil, a little grain. Taste doesn't back up the big aroma, but it's still solid - melon, tropical fruit, OJ, light hop spice and bitterness. Nothing mind-blowing, but nothing objectionable. Feel super soft and smooth."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.9,"#93, yummy!"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.54,"A: Pours a hazy orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing

S: Lots of citrus, especially orange and grapefruit, up front along with some lighter tropical fruit notes and dank undertones

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the citrus and tropical fruit, followed by some berry and dank notes. Light bitterness. Finishes with lingering citrus

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the smooth, fluffy side

O: A great DDH DIPA that is extremely easy to drink. A citrus and tropical fruit juice bomb. Definitely worth checking out"
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.59,"In terms of haze bombs, this beer is about as attractive as they come. Good head production and retention; excellent lacing. Body is a hue somewhere around mango flesh, hazy but not pulpy, and opaque except in the thinnest portions of the glass.

Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness.

Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.

Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.

This beer is the real deal. Absolutely superb."
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,4.46,"16 oz can poured into a pint glass. Tons of tropical and citrus fruit. Nice wheaty backbone. The 8.5% abv is well-hidden. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with juuuust a hint of hop burn. Overall it's a great (D)NEIPA and IMO a ""hit"" from a brewery that I consider to be very much hit-or-miss."
Consecration,4.54,"Incredible. Best sour ale on the market. Beautiful cabernet flavor with notes of raspberry, oak, currant, blackberry, and orange. It's as complex as wine while still being beer. I hope they offer it in more stores."
Consecration,4.46,"Poured from a 12.68 ounce bottle dated 11/5/20 into a snifter.

Look- Amber brown, clear, no visible particulate, fine cream colored head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Very fragrant, black currant, tobacco, plum, blackberry, black cherry, brett, oak, black licorice.

Taste- Black currant, black pepper, brett, plum, blackberry, black cherry, transitions during the sip from sweet/sour to just sour.

Feel- Between medium and full body, very mouth watering upfront, highly dry at finish, soft, silky, sour finish, moderately mouth coating, below average carbonation.

Overall- Highly complex beer with an abundance of flavor and a powerful bouquet. Nice balance of plum, black currant, blackberry, and black cherry made for a wonderful experience."
Consecration,4.39,"Received via NBS BIF #13 from @Jayorear.
Poured brown with tints of red, the beige head grew to about 1 cm and settled to a thin film leaving no lacing.
Aroma had red wine vinegar and, oddly, red wine (I mean, how do they get both of those aromas to come through?)
The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.
The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.
Thanks Jay, this was amazing!"
Consecration,4.41,"Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.

Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.

Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing.

Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

4.35/5 rDev -3.1%
look: 4.0| smell: 4.0 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5| overall: 4.5

750mL bottle (batch 003X3) poured into a snifter. Pours a clear mahogany with minimal head, champagne carbonation. A ring of bubbles forms around the edge of the glass.

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.

Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

This is not a beer I would drink every day, but definitely worth revisiting once in a while."
Consecration,4.31,"375ml bottle, tulip, bottled 2/26/20.

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam.

It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness.

Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries.

Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick.

When I picked this bottle up last year I was surprised I hadn’t had Consecration. It’s just a super well done beer."
Consecration,4.21,"Brief Review:

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better."
Consecration,4.4,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 7-12-21; consumed 5-3-22.

Beer poured a red wine color with a fizzy carbonated head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is cherry and strawberry forward and red wine barrel that gives a touch of leather.

Taste is a wonderful balance of leather, red wine vinegar, cherries and strawberries, finishing very clean with each sip.

Mouthfeel is light and delightfully smooth.

Overall a really well executed beer!"
Consecration,4.5,"Bottled 7/12/21

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather

Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%

Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall"
Consecration,4.5,"Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging. A slight tartness like red wine vinegar, but also currants and berries. Delicious and complex, as the flavors unfold from first taste to finish."
Consecration,4.75,"I've had this beer since 2011 and it's from when they were still doing batch numbers rather than bottling dates.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.
T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience."

Russian River Brewing
Date: 05 November 2020
Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present.

The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical.

The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky.

The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.

This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!"
Consecration,4.24,"Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head.

Sour and sharp with notes of leather and tobacco rounded by floral and wood.

Sour, leather, tobacco, up front with notes of citrus & lime. A sharp sour punch, finishes dry and woody"
Consecration,4.78,"What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here. An excellent beer that few would find controversial."
Consecration,3.52,"Shared bottle, RBNAG 2011. Barrel aged 6 months, with currants added. Reddish brown colour. Intense farmhouse aroma, sour fruit, oak and spices. Sour flavour, good but not impressive."
Summerfest,1.22,Completely missed the mark. It's a water that wants to be a beer.
Summerfest,4.31,"Poured into shaker pint. Pale whitbierish gold, thin white head.

Grassy hops in the nose with a hint of citrus.

Taste follows with some biscuity malt backbone.

Crisp clean finish.

Could see this being great on a lake, as nature intended. Not a bad American pils."
Summerfest,3.98,light crisp and refreshing. definitely would drink again. not heavy at all. perfect light craft style beer. perfect for casual easy drinking. i love it a lot. one of my faves
Summerfest,3.75,"Light biscuit and subtle noble hop nose. Light, slight hop and malt on palate. Crisp slightly dry finish."
Summerfest,3.34,"Appearance: Straw/pale gold, brilliant clarity. Head an opaque white with mid-size bubbles, lasts about 5 mins.
Aroma: White bread, toast. Light and quick.
Taste: Malt: White bread, oats/wheat, nutty, very light caramel. Hops: Floral/lemony.
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, slick-ish feel.
Overall: Light, sessionable summer lager. Poolside beer. A little extra hop bitterness/bite than your typical. Lemony, goes well with pasta. Good by itself, inoffensive."
Summerfest,3.24,"As I sit on a rock in the shallow waters of the Pemigewasset River, I can't help but to sit an enjoy my fleeting moments of Summer with this years Summer Fest Lager. It has a pleasant golden glow that glistens like the water that runs over the white rocks. It is crisp like the brisk water that cool you off from the sun's August rays. Some earthy notes tickle your nose and you then taste this beer's lemony, malty goodness that ends with a slight bitter after taste. All in all a solid summertime lager, but nothing too fancy."
Summerfest,3.96,"Look: Lovely clear gold just what a pilsner should look like. One finger head that dissipated quickly. Slow rising bubbles but not a lot.
Smell: Earthy spicy noble hops over a nice bready malt
Taste: Surprisingly sweet at first. Bold and hoppy (like a pilsner of course, not hoppy like an IPA). Great balance between hoppiness and maltiness. And between sweet and bitter, obviously leaning more toward bitter.
Flavor: Tastes like a sunny afternoon in a Prague café. Herbal with lemon zest. Bready malt with a softer peppery bitterness.
Feel: Medium mouthfeel, clean crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. Dry bitter finish.
Overall: I have tried to steer myself away from drink all IPA’s all the time, so this is another in a stream of pilsners that I have tried. American Brewers are nailing pilsners, Everyone I taste is as good or better than the last. Looks great in the glass smells like what I used to think was a pilsner that was of European origin. When I was in Europe in 1980, I was embarrassed of behalf of American beer. The beers I drank in Europe inspired me to drink European beers for all of the 80’s and well into the 90’s. We obviously gained a lot of ground when IPA’s swept the beer landscape. I don’t know when American brewers began to equal the great pilsners of Europe, but they have."
Summerfest,4,"Light gold, pretty clear and a slight amount of head with some lacing. On first whiff you notice bready malts with that ubiquitous Sierra Nevada aroma that runs like a thread through most of their lighter ales and lagers. The taste is a nice peppery hop snap with a smooth malt backbone, biscuity, and a little herbal. It’s also well carbonated and super easy to drink on a warm day. This was from the second batch in June so there is no “fade” in this bottle.
In closing, what can I say that hasn’t been said before; it’s old reliable, SN, easy to find, the price is always right and they always do a nice job of coming close to the style they’re brewing with their own stamp on it. One bottle left in the second sixer and I do believe I’ll spring for a third with a heatwave coming this week, cheers!"
Summerfest,3.95,"I've only had this a few times, since I'm usually not drawn to lagers (except pilsners). But it really is a nice go-to beer when you want something simple and don't have much selection to choose from.

Pours with a transparent golden body and white head. Specks of lacing decorate the glass, but it's nothing to write home about. Great can art.

Biscuit, lemon, lime and white pepper notes grace the nose, bringing a slightly funky malt base reminiscent of the kolsch style. Hints of basil and yeasty pizza dough on the finish. Simple, but nice.

Taste is exactly as expected from the aroma. Just enough bitterness to call itself a beer. The hops are quite restrained and the lager yeast and malt shine. Farmy hay notes on the finish.

Smooth and light texture. It could stand to be lighter, but not by much. It still tastes like food to me, which I consider essential.

Really good for the style, appropriate for the weather and widely available. SN always delivers. Cheers!"
Summerfest,3.78,"A - Pours a clear golden body, fat white head.

S - Grassy spice hop, with just a touch of honey on the nose.

T - Nice bright open with the honey note prominent, cracker malt middle, and a sharp bitter bite in the finish.

M - Brisk carbonation, light weight, dry close.

O - I pleasant summer drinker, as advertised."
Summerfest,2.96,"A: Brief bright white, pillowy head that recedes to a thin line; not much retention. Clear yellow straw, perhaps a bit darker.
S: Dominant smell is lemon, and a bit on the soap/polish side. Metallic as it continues to warm.
T: Hay, lemon up front. Does have some bitterness, but in an almost acrid kind of way. Rather unpleasant.
F: Very round and full mouthfeel.
O: Wish I was getting some of the yeastier/breadier notes others have mentioned, but as is, this one is a disappointment."
Summerfest,3.88,"Super clear gold with one finger head.

Barleycorn and wheats, lil hoppy, faint feet.

Feels pretty good, semi dry/semi sweet. Balanced bitterness and malt fullness.

Pretty good, it’s a beer."
Summerfest,3.83,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium-golden color with a strong white head that sits quietly for a while. SRM of 6. (4.25)

Aroma: Light aromas of orange citrus, apple, grape. Some bread dough sweetness. The aroma is subdued and subtle, but it has that classic SN orange citrus/nectar aroma. (3.75)

Flavor: Initial flavors of yeast and grainy upfront. Followed by an orchard fruit quality. There's sweet orange & apple juice. A slight bitterness comes through on the end, but the yeast finishes it dry. Again, the classic SN orange citrus/nectar flavor. Even a little bit of pine. (3.75)

Feel: Light, crispy, well-carbonated. Good carbonation and yeast finish it dry with nothing left on the palate. Goes down extremely light. (3.75)

Compared to Alaskan Kolsch 6/14/20: Pours a lighter color. More orange/nectar and apple juice flavors. Less malty sweetness and cherry. Overall, lighter and cleaner.

Compared to Zipline Brewing's Kolsch 7/5/20: Pours a darker color. Stronger fruit and hoppy aromas. Less malty bread. A bit more of a citrus and crispy bite.

Compared to Trader Joe's Josephbra Czech Pilsner 8/14/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More orange dish soap on the aroma. Less bread. Dryer, crisper.

Compared to Oberon 8/23/20: Pours a similar color. More nectarine/apple/bread on the aroma. Less dry orange. Overall, sweeter.

Compared to SN Oktoberfest 2020, 8/23/20: Pours a lighter color. More pale malts and orcharfruit aromas. Less resinous orange/nectar. Slightly more tart and less bready. Overall, these are quite similar. I think we all know who copied whose homework.

Overall: A pretty good summer drink. Not exactly a Czech-style pilsner. Not really in hardly any aspect except slightly bready. It's got more fruit and yeast, with little signs of any noble hops. I actually mislabeled this as a Kolsch. It has more Kolsch orchard fruit flavors. Lots of nectarine/peach/apple. It actually has classic Sierra Nevada orange soap flavors too. Finishes on the dry side, with less malts for a Czech pils and more classic and resinous Sierra Nevada orange pine. (Final Rating: 3.83)

*Compare to a dense Kolsch*"
Summerfest,4.4,"Look: Light golden in color, clear and a vigorous pour brings on a good head that recedes leaving good lacing
Aroma: Pilsner malt, cut grass, slight lemon notes, and earthy and spicy hops
Taste: Biscuit and cracker-like malt up intermingles with herbal, earthy, and slightly spicy hops in good balance. Finishes very clean and crisp
Mouthfeel: Clean, balanced, and light but not watery. Medium carbonation and a huge depth of flavor but not at all so that it leads to a heavy feel
Overall: Awesome stuff. Crisp, balanced, and full of flavor. This has always been a beer that doesn't fit into typical style boxes IMO - somewhere between a Czech Pilsner, an American Lager, and a Kolsch for my palate. Honestly though, who cares - all I know is it is tasty and a regular occupant of my fridge during its seasonal release."
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,3.44,"Pours hazy golden-straw color with a good fizzy white head that doesn't last long, not much lacing, light grassy and flowery aromas. Bready and grainy mild sweetness turns hoppy and bitter with some dryness in the finish. Light bodied with a soft but crisp carbonated mouthfeel, very clean and crisp, very nice."
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,3.27,Good satisfying beer overall but clean finish which I expect on Pilsner beer isn’t there
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,4.04,"I am always a fan of nice, golden German Pilsner and this beer is exactly that. Nice dryness to it and low ABV that I would expect. Nice balance between the honey sweetness and a touch of bitterness. Perfect to drink in the bar with some friends or by the fire in your home during the winter cold. Samuel Adams always had a great seasonal selection and this is yet another example."
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,3.51,"Gold with one finger white head. The nose is lightly spicy hops with lemon, pine, earth, floral, and crackery malt in the back, and a little yeasty flavor. The flavor is pretty earth-forward with a decent amount of pine and pepper. Has a strong certain dryness that melds with the moderate bitterness yet is contrasted by a light honey sweetness. Medium bodied, medium carbonation."
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,3.66,"12-oz bottle into Pilsner glass

A - 3 fingers white foam over a transparent body of straw; moderate visible carbonation; decent web of lace

S - floral, citrus, and grain with a touch of spice

T - bread, peppery spice, lemony citrus, floral, bitter finish

M - highly-carbonated light/medium body

O - Not really my thing, but pretty good for the style."
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,3.77,"Clear gold orange color .just under medium body with about average carbonation. Body suits the style well
Aroma is floral earthy hops, perfect amount of malt.grain,cracker, yeast and what seems like just a bit if spice
Taste is crisp, nice hop bite and very subtle malt sweetness.
I'm not usually a fan of Sam Adam's offerings but this was an impressive attempt at the style"
Samuel Adams Noble Pils,4,"Nobility beware! Is this a step above rolling rock, it sure is! It seems that the hops are more pronounced on the nose of this beer. It has a lot character and a lot of balance between flavors. Reminds me of a hoppy pilsner that has stayed the course of freshness and stays crisp.

Moderate biscuit and subtle bread-like malt flavors. Low noble hops flavors that are much in the background. Slightly sticky mouth-coating finish that is more malt than hops. The citrus hops add an unexpected complexity."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.09,2017 vintage. Enjoyed on 05/14/2022
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.25,"2018 vintage; consumed on 1/11/22

Pours a clear jet-crimson body with sharp, blood-red highlights and topped with a finger and a half of creamy, pale beige foam; sub-par head retention fades to a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a large, frothy collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aromas of harsh, ripe whiskey breed burnt sugar, smoked butterscotch and caramel, and a decadent prune/plum compote; shreds of whiskey umami and soy varnish make way for floral oak barrel carrying vanilla icing against potent bourbon lingering as a final impressor.

Taste shows burnt sugar and toffee swirled into fig syrup upfront, with plummy esters lingering through the mid-palate to a bourbon back end, leaving a dusting of cocoa to finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with minimal carbonation and a semi-oily viscosity, maintaining a slickness into the mid-palate; a char is intertwined in a mild, tannic twang with incredible subtlety on the back end of the palate, where a piercing, encompassing warmth peaks into the finish.

Cresting at the potent richness of boozy barrel peaks, ascendant dark fruit jams near umami status against an unrelenting spirit and fresh oak barrel interplay; structure and detail at the highest levels of barleywine."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.71,"For purposes of this review, the 2014 vintage was sampled.

Appearance - The beer poured a rusty red color with a few white bubbles crowning the top of the glass.

Smell - The nose was a sweet bready barleywine, with hints of bourbon. This pretty much nailed the expectation.

Taste - The profile had the appropriate level of sweetness. There were notes of raisin, tobacco, orange rind, big caramel, and a nice mild alcohol burn at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The feel was smooth, almost slick with carbonation largely faded.

Overall - This is fairly old school, but it is still elite."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.63,"Vintage 2018 - quite low carb, which really accentuates the rich, oily body of the beer. There is a ton of thick caramel to the beer - sweet, but nicely balanced by malt and hops. Smooth, zero trace of the ABV, with a surprisingly clean finish. The nose isn't powerful but very accurately communicates the rich toffee and caramel of the beer.

Sofa king good. Highly recommended."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.5,"Drinks smooth w/o strong fusel presence, but warms the insides and clearly swings above 14.5%.

Absolutely still, a slightly translucent dirty amber. No head, leaves transparent sheeting on the glass.

Smells of oxidation--sweet toffee, sherry, the library attic, light unsweetened peanut, and faint marshmallow--and a curious crab apple/orchard rot undertone.

Taste follows nose: sherry, brandy, orange liquor, old books, faint peanut and marshmallow, and drying crabapple on the finish. Drinks like 18%, but in a wonderful way--so close to a fine spirit, yet just far enough away to remain drinkable and assert itself as a beer.

Kuhnhenn bros strike again!"
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.52,"Pours an amazing ruby red with a head that dissipates immediately. Smells is super spicy. I would guess this was aged in a rye barrel if it didn’t specifically say bourbon. It’s a sipper. 14.5% drinks like 80 proof. It’s a monster, and a masterpiece."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.24,Winter solstice 2018. Drank in winter spring 2018/2019. Forgot to write details.
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.31,"2017 vintage poured into a Founders KBS stem. Thanks to @FlintB for sending this my way during NBS BIF#007!

Pour is the medium brown of rich toffee or dates. Lightening at the corner, and nary a hint of a head save for a few scattered soapy bubbles that accumulate at the edge.

Cold, the nose leads with a woody character and some faint chocolate and alcohol. I'mma let this warm up for a bit, because I have a sneaking suspicion I pulled it too cold from the fridge and it will benefit from opening up a little bit.
OK. Checking back in on it I think I made the right move. While still lead by the woody character of the barrel, there is a little more depth and richness to it as well as some slight char on the malts.

Rich notes of caramel and vanilla and sugar dates. Spicy bourbon influence and some tobacco and leather... classic BW flavours wrapped in a sipping level bourbon influence that is incredibly rich and creamy and smoothe.

Big smoothe rich body. Like velvet on the tongue. Carbonation plays off the spicy bourbon notes nicely. Definitely a sipper, but 14.5% is not as in your face as I would have expected. Just incredibly smoothe and rich and impressively drinkable for how big it is.

Very much enjoying this one. Thanks for sending it along Brian!!"
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,3.27,"This was the 2011 version, the label is different, it isn't black and gold as pictured, this one is like white and pink lettering.

Pours almost black, tons of malt, this is very dark brown with almost no head on the top, 1/10"" is too generous of a size. Aroma is heavy on the boozy toffee. Toffee and bourbon, all day every day.

Taste, whooosh, this is a strong one. Damn. Just oppressive heat, caramel, toffee, like roasted AF toffee/caramel here, scorched earth policy. A lot of raisin bitterness as if this was a Russian Imperial Barleywine or some shit with pumped up dark fruit pushing weight around the projects. I dunno, I know its not popular to say, but I found this one to be a quite hot, and not up to its reputation. Loved 4d and whatnot, but I dunno, this was hotter and I can think of plenty of bourbon barrel barleywines I would rather have that are easier to acquire. I do like the convenient format though."
Bourbon Barrel-Aged Barley Wine,4.4,"Toffee on Toffee, sweet molasses with a coating malt finish. It's a bit hot but still delicious. Oak and caramel dominate the senses. Would call this one of the better barleywines that I've ever had, a true classic to style."
Traquair House Ale,4.46,"I really like the color on this one. Held in front of a mag light, it's kind of a shiny metallic red/brown. Smells good too. Malty, woody, and vinous. Flavor is rich malt, oak, and surprisingly a pleasant 'fruitiness'. Tannins from the cask apparent, which mingle with hops and add some black tea notes. Resinous mouth feel, briny carbonation. A wee bit light in body for a heavy. Alcohol undetectable. I love this beer!"
Traquair House Ale,4.32,"Purchased at Purvis Beer in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne in Australia, in November 2021.

Colour is hard to describe. Is it muddy brown, or amber, or dark, burnt copper? Maybe all of them...

Aroma has cola, some dark fruits, a tangy caramellyness and some tobacco.

Taste has sweetness, brown sugar (burnt?), molasses, raisins and red fruit. Alcohol is unnoticeable.

Mouthfeel is well balanced with mild carbonation.

Overall this is an excellent, and given how well it hides its alcohol, possibly quite dangerous, beer. It screams of warm fires, misty walks and fog-bound valleys. Beer as a device for long contemplation is on display in this glass. If this is what the Scottish Lairds were drinking back in the day they fortunate men!

Cheers!"

Traquair House Ale,3.42,"Pours a dark brown with a light tan head that dissipates quickly.

Tastes of light toasted malts with a tad of dark fruit in the mix. There is a bit of barrel but you have to search for it and a slight bitterness in the finish. Thin body and mouthfeel, I was hoping for more ""scotch ale"" but was left wanting it to be more than it was."
Traquair House Ale,4.15,"500mL bottle stamped BBE MAY 29 poured into thistle glass at just above fridge temp 7.2% ABV. The beer pours light to medium brown in color with reddish highlights and milky, light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. The aroma is faint with rich malt, cocoa, leather and earthy hops. The taste is rich, deeply toasted malt with subtle smokiness. Earthy flavors of leather, tobacco and oak can also be found before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good. Subtle, balanced and complex."
Traquair House Ale,4.08,"A: Pours a nice deep brown/cola color, perfectly translucent. Head is light tan, very small with poor retention.

S: Medium strength smell. It does smell like Scottish malt man. You get some caramel, vanilla, buckwheat honey, figs/prunes/dates and some banana bread. It has quite a bit of musk too.

T: Medium strength taste. It does taste like Scottish malt too. You get caramel, vanilla, buckwheat honey, prunes and banana bread like the smell. You also get leather and oak tannins and some light peat. Coffee on the retrohale. Not a lot of residual sugars and slightly sour like some whisky's can be. A bit mineral. Super old school.

M: Medium mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation. No stickiness.

O: This is a nice blast from the past. Old school flavors all around. Really reminiscent of Scottish whisky's."
Traquair House Ale,3.6,"Bottled on 6/29/17; best before 6/28/27

Pours an almost glistening brownish amber with near-purple highlights and topped with a fast-rising multiple fingers of pillowy mocha-beige foam; head holds endlessly, slowly fading to a thick, creamy cap and collar long with an equally dense walling of chunky lacing.

Aroma is subtle though expanding, with a deepening complexity of wood and dates sweetened by a milk chocolate undercurrent; apple core, smoked fig, dusted almond, and tart plum skins feature heavily in a secondary capacity.

Taste profile is an even softer and fading profile of oak, dried plum, prune, and apple skin upfront, while woody milk chocolate shows on the back end with a dusty cocoa exhale.

Mouthfeel has a medium body lifted by an almost untamed fluffy carbonation, expanding a cloudy lightness throughout; steadily thinning, though picks up for a more rounded finish highlighting a mild malty grit and an almost spritzy heft from a carbonation still going strong.

Light and drinkable considering its ABV, thought the oak aging leaves plenty to be desired as it holds bar minimum bearing on the profile; decent overall and far from an ale to turn down, just far too passive to progress beyond anything average."
Traquair House Ale,4.08,"Poured from just under fridge temp. Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish tinge. A good amount of tan head that sticks around for a few minutes. Nose is rich toffee, malts, brown sugar, wheat, and raisins. The taste is super interesting. Not what I was expecting. Definitely not as sweet as the Scotch ales from the US. Almost a bit salty. Definitely some nice toffee, licorice, chocolate, raisins, bread, and a touch of earthiness. A somewhat dry and lighter mouthfeel. Overall, very impressive!"
Traquair House Ale,4,"Serving: Bottle
Best Before: January 2029 (Consumed Jan-19-2020)


It pours ruby and clear but looks opaque mahogany in the glass with a couple inches of tan, foam-insulation head that descends to a healthy film. Some lacing. Very appealing-looking. The aroma is crusty brown bread, dark fruits, a hint of banana bread without enough bananas, caramelized sugar. It tastes similar but a little different. Bready and sweet with some tea-like earthy bite in the middle, slight mineraly bite and thinness that rounds out a little as it warms up from 50°. This is a nice traditional Scottish beer and I'm glad to have got to tried it. A textbook wee heavy as far as I am concerned. Personally, I could do with a little thicker body and a little more roundness and complexity in the flavor compared to the aroma, but regardless it was very tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed trying it.

Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.12,"250 ml bottle 2013 vintage. Poured 10 cl into a Pilsner glass for this review. The rest I drank from the bottle, a practice men have evidently abandoned in late stage capitalist dystopia.
L: this one is attractive! Opaque black, wisps of a tan head that lasted slightly longer than a typical BA reviewer in Nicole Kidman’s bed.
S: I read the bottle. Don’t read the bottle if you have never tried a beer but might want to review it. I have my nose in this glass searching for the purported pear notes and ignoring what I do pick up. It’s sharp and rich; good cacao, roasted malt, raisins. I can smell that 10%.
T: oh this is good. More bitterness than I expected but not in a gross IPA way. More like bakers chocolate. A little coffee - dark roast, not espresso. Raisins are present but it’s not sweet.
F: never know what to say here. Not thin but definitely not the heaviness I expected. Almost zero carbonation. Smooth.
Overall: I am impressed. Added it to a Drizly order on a whim. Glad I did!"
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,3.42,"Shared 250 ml bottle, brewed by Courage 1992. ABV is 10.0%. Black colour, no head nor carbonation. Aroma of roast malts, molasses and dark dried fruits, oxidised of course, but not bad. Sweet flavour with the same elements. No acidity."

11/22/20

Bottle to snifter. 2012 vintage though I just picked this up a few weeks ago, so god knows where it has been.

LOOK: thick black, full look, small tan head fades quickly, but reforms admirably.
AROMA: super pungent, very nice mix of cocoa, fig, dates, prunes, roasted malt, red wine.
TASTE: roasted malt comes through more here than the dark fruit notes, but they are also present.
FEEL: super smooth, a little flat, but to be expected with an 8 year old thick stout.

Very Impressed. This is a beautiful and simple beer from a time before Pastry Stouts and Hop-Bombs, and Super Sours. not to disparage those other things too much, but you have to respect getting so much flavor and mileage from a simple recipe.

Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.18,"275mL bottle bb 8/16/25 (2012 vintage) poured into a snifter at fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours very dark brown to black in color with light brown head. There was a small head from an aggressive pour that settled to a film and thin ring quickly. There is some lacing left behind. The aroma is dark roasty coffee and dark chocolate with licorice and fruit mixed in. The taste is bittersweet, mildly ashy chocolate and roast malt that finishes with apple, pear, vague smoke and tobacco. Bitterness is medium to heavy. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. There is a hint of alcohol as the beer approaches room temp. Overall, very good. I would like to try this with both less and more years. The complexity is still there at 6 years old but all the flavors and aromas kind of run together. Worth a try if you enjoy the style. Original review date 11/20/18.

I thought this bottle would be younger, but with an 02/09/26 date it's around the same age at time of review. 2013 bottle. Turns out the brewery holds these bottles for 5 years before turning them loose. Purchased in a gift pack with a snifter and a 2012 bottle that will be aging for a while. Original review stands. Lovely beer. July 19, 2019."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.05,"from 2011, so about 8 years old now, definitely mature, definitely a little oxidized, but made for this kind of ageing obviously, and still doing just fine. we enjoyed this one as a night cap last night, seemed like a good evening for something old and dark and strong, now that fall has fully set in here in denver. its more brown than black in the glass, chocolate looking, a little dusty looking too, with a patchy tan head bubbling up slowly. it smells like its been in the bottle awhile, but has a classic english grain profile, the dark bitter roasted elements tamed a bit by time, and plenty of english crystal type sweetness through it for balance. the yeast is bready and timeless, and to me makes this beer, even though it isnt a central flavor agent or anything, it really brings it together, adds a cool maturity to it, and makes it special to me. lots of chocolate to it, some brown sugar and molasses too, hints of wet tobacco and licorice as well, but not overly complex, its old enough to sort of be decaying in on itself just a little, smoothed out some nuance but really a pleasant drink, no trace of its alcohol strength either after the initial vapor dissipates. im not sure i would keep this for much longer in the cellar, it seems about maxed out right now, still delicious, but i cant imagine any more time being good for it. cool beer, aged really well, a great cap on a really fun evening with new friends, and a perfect segue into fall. id like to try it fresh to compare..."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.17,"From 275 ml bottle into tall glass. You don't need a pint glass for this one. Pours dark and syrupy, tan head, coffee/liquorice aroma. Head fades quickly to patchy froth. Taste is blackened grain, caramel, coffee, alcohol and Vegemite (an Australian yeast extract that you spread on toast). A little less impressed on this sampling than previous, but still an iconic stout and deserves its reputation."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.14,"1977 bottle. Poured from slightly colder than cellar temp, but allowed to warm. Slight hiss when I cracked the cap, which was surprising. Other than that, no signs of carbonation. Nose is heavy on licorice, molasses, and dark fruit. A bit of root beer and soy sauce as well, but not in an off-putting way. Taste shares some similarities with the nose, but has a distinct smokiness and burnt taste. Bitterness sticks around on the palate, and this is a burnt taste. Plenty of black licorice and some distinct soy sauce flavors. Not getting the root beer from the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Overall, I am really glad to try this 41 year old beer, and it didn't disappoint."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.18,"2012 Vintage

Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.89,"1993 Vintage, 170ml bottle into white wine glass

I was skeptical of ordering a bottle from my birth year, but wow was I impressed. Poured deep dark brown, sediment stayed stuck to the bottom of the bottle for the most part. Smell and taste was overwhelmingly sherry, I would not have believed you if you told me it was in the 10/11% ABV range."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.12,"2012 Vintage. Very dark black pour with almost no head at all. Scent is of Raisons with a subtle hint of chocolate. Raison flavor with chocolate in the aftertaste. Very mild amount of coffee as well. A little heavy and slightly boozy on the tongue. Very drinkable, but it is a sipper."
Courage Imperial Russian Stout,4.83,Ideal Russian Stout; full of espresso and coffee like flavors. Rich and full bodied a simply great stout. I drank this one fresh; so rich and full of flavor and alcohol that it will age wonderfully. I will grab a few to sit down.
Morning Wood,4.59,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.

Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.

Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.

Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all.

Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure."
Morning Wood,4.53,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish."
Morning Wood,4.5,On tap at Castaways for the tap takeover. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Loads of maple and bourbon aromas. The taste follows suit with pronounced black coffee and dark roasted malts. Hints of oak. Good body and mouthfeel.
Morning Wood,4.49,"Yes Maple please. This thing is something I would pour over pancakes.
Strong maple with a bit of coffee and hint of barrel.
If you enjoy maple beers this one is right up there."
Morning Wood,4.25,Not a huge FB fan. This was decent but a little thing
Morning Wood,4.65,"Bottle courtesy of Scottsbeer out of Flo-rida.
L: black with moderate brown head.
S: coffee, Malt, brown sugar, chocolate, maple. (Fresh Maple bar smell dominates).
T: roasty coffee, chocolate malt, maple/brown sugar, Slight smoke and/or bitterness. No bacon specifically.
F: medium.
Overall: Very good porter. Hard to distinguish between this and a stout. Maple sweetness and coffee dominate. Reminds me of beers I recently had... mornin’ delight, kbbs, cbs, and that’s a pretty high compliment considering their ratings. Clearly world-class barrel aging going on."
Morning Wood,4.44,"I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-(

Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing.

Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through.

Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more.

Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple.

Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+."
Morning Wood,4.74,"Jet black body topped with a thick and creamy, tan colored head. Alluring aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa and vanilla; faint, boozy scent. Decadently rich, sweet flavors; milk chocolate and maple syrup; vanilla; whiskey. Heavy, silky smooth body; velvety and chewy; dull, prominent sweetness to the mouthfeel; twinge of alcohol warmth.

A heady, extremely tasteful and lip smacking bit of rich porter flavor. World class all the way..."
Morning Wood,5,"2019 Bottle poured into Brandy Snifter

L: Dark and beautiful as a porter should be. Great tan head with good lacing throughout the entire (short) life of the beer.
S: Slightly sweet and inviting. Maybe a hint of bourbon on the nose (but my nose is pretty weak in this area.)
T: This is my #1 beer so I personally feel that is is the best porter I've ever tried. I routinely buy every bottle I can find. Great taste that's slightly sweet without any alcohol burn/aftertaste. Smooth tasting with a hint of maple and bourbon. Best porter or stout I've had.
F: Everything a porter should be, smooth and silky with a clean and hearty feel in the mouth.

My #1 beer!!!! Closely followed by Untitled Art White Chocolate Macadamia, Untitled Art Hazelnut, CBS, and a little further down the list, Wicked Weed German Chocolate Cake just to give you some reference."
Raspberry Eisbock,3.76,"2007 vintage. 6.3oz. Bottle / 13.8% abv. Pours a deep claret hue with no head. Nose expresses an abundance of raspberry (surprising, given the age), as well as a hint cocoa in the background. Taste consistent with nose; however, oxidation has definitely set in and there are some vinegar notes at the finish. Mouthfeel is light in body with a still carbonation. Overall, interesting and still complex, despite being past it’s prime."
Raspberry Eisbock,4.42,"2016 vintage

Now this is a beer I’ve wanted for a long time. Kuhnhenn doesn’t distribute out in Mass, so I’m thrilled to finally get my hands on this, the highest rated Eisbock on BA. Eisbock is a style I’d love to find more of in general, but one this highly regarded is exciting. Let’s pop it open

Pours a muddy brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, the nose on this is incredibly expressive and spirit driven, it’s so complex. I’m picking up on aromas of tart jammy raspberry, cherry cordial, milk chocolate, sweet caramel, port wine, brown bread, raisin, nutty malt and sticky molasses

It loses its tart edge in taste, and maybe that’s a function of its age, but it is still complex and tasty. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting jammy raspberry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, sweet wine, fig, and brown bread. The swallow brings notes of cherry cordial, cocoa powder, port wine, sticky molasses, jammy raspberry, toffee, and earthy wood

A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a boozy and slick beer. Finishes neutral with a little tingle, but drinks well below the listed 15.5%

While the taste was lacking a bit, this was still a fantastic beer! I definitely need to get my hands on a fresh bottle some day. It is very close to a liqueur or just a straight up raspberry filled chocolate, but the complexity sets it apart"
Raspberry Eisbock,4.43,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a snifter. pours a murky, dirty ruby red with a finger of sandy brown foam head. raspberries aplenty on the nose. a tinge of chocolate malt and even a faint whiff of alcohol burn. more raspberries on the taste with a lovely chocolate and malty background. not that there is anything wrong with the nose but the flavors are so much more complex than the aromas would lead you to believe. really smooth for such a high ABV. thick, full mouthfeel. very hard to tell this one is 15%. it’s a sipper for sure, and while it carrie’s qualities of old ales and doppelbocks alike, it drinks like an 8% fruited stout. really interesting style of beer. hope to try more of this style."
Raspberry Eisbock,4.2,"2017 vintage, enjoyed on 12/16/2021. Low carbonation, medium body, alcohol extremely well hidden at 15+%. Sweet, ripe raspberries front and center with bittersweet dark chocolate undertones."
Raspberry Eisbock,4.45,"Pours a dark burgundy-brown with a muddy, turbid transparency. Head is a thin film of fizzy bubbles that dissipates quickly. Aroma is raspberry right up front with a rich sugary and tart consistency. Nutty, bready, toasty malts add some depth and firmness. It smells sugary and sweet in total. Flavor profile is much more balanced with nutty, bready, toasty malts sandwiched between notes of raspberry, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee. While the aroma carries a lot more initial sweetness, the flavor profile is more of a lingering, sticky sweetness that comes on stronger a few seconds after a sip. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a still effervescence which combines well with expansive texture to form a thick blanket of sweetness atop the tongue each sip and every sip. Overall, sugary and sweet, but all within balance. This is a fun one to sip on with that initial berry sweetness mingling well with the dessert-like qualities.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16.9floz bottle."
Raspberry Eisbock,3.99,"Bottle purchased at Barrels & Vines. Didn’t see a date.

Pour: ruby colored, minimal head. Not much lacing.

Nose: raspberry, fruit, a little malty biscuit.

Taste: raspberry, chocolate, biscuity malt. Subtle hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: fairly high carbonation but not overdone. Crisp, refreshing feel.

Overall: really liked this and I think I would like, and appreciate, even more the next time around. Fair amount of complexity relative to what I expected. Definitely worth trying and I’m looking forward to another."
Raspberry Eisbock,4.36,"Gusher from the bottle, although head retention is less than spectacular. Very lively and crystal clear brew, dark brown with garnet highlights.

On the nose, there's a blend of dark caramel, a touch of oxidation, and very light notes of raspberry.

The palate is a tale of two halves. Up front, caramel, toffee, burnt brown sugar, and wood take the lead. Raspberries start to emerge on the second half, however, first slightly sweet, then tart.

Incredibly smooth and drinkable, especially for such a high ABV brew. Mouthfeel is nothing less than superb."
Raspberry Eisbock,4.21,"Poured a hazy reddish hue with no head. Very little carbonation present. The smell offered a heavy grain malt with fragrance of jammy raspberries. There’s also an alcoholic presence to the nose; it really smells like a fruity cocktail at a college party. The flavors were quite similar, very heavy dark malt paired with raspberry Twizzlers. The alcohol creeps up to you at the finish with a sharp and almost metallic burn. The mouthfeel is heavy, thick and with a slight burn. Overall, I liked it a lot. It leaves me impressed by how different this beer is among others. It is one of a kind, but it does have a hefty price tag."

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,3,"probably a decent weisse beer, just not my style or taste for more than one, not a hefe fan."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,Its a shame when you’ve had the last one. 5 out of 5.
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.67,"This is a solid weissbier. Pours a hazy amber with a good, foamy head. Taste is of wheat and yeast. Overall, a fine weissbier.

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4,Not too much tartness up front. Nice amount of spices on finish. Easy to drink. Owned by AB Inbev.
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.03,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: 07.01.2022 (L007136)
Glass: 0.5L Hefeweizen Vase
Temp at Pour: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Opaque orange-tinged gold. I can see shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass, but that's it. Initial 2-3-finger white head soon collapses to a thin (0.25"") but consistent cover. Decent lacing.

Smell:
Bananas, citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, and notes of apricot/peach. White bread dough. A faint hint of cloves. There is that ""twang"" that I detect in most Weissbiers (and also more general wheat beers).

Taste:
Everything from the nose is present here, with a greater emphasis on the bananas, especially the overripe kind. Sweet oranges shine through the citrus. The cloves are also more pronounced and are joined by some cinnamon, but they only serve to balances the greater sweetness that the taste possesses. There is a hint of bubblegum towards the end, but the finish is restrained cloves and soft sweetness.

Feel:
Smooth, creamy, and soft with a medium body that can drift a shade light.

Overall:
A very good Weissbier that is more about the bananas and (citrus) fruits than about the cloves and spices. While not in the same tier as Weihenstephaner, Schneider, Ayinger, or Andechs, it is only one tier removed from those stalwarts. And is typically easier to find. A fine Weissbier for a spring or early summer afternoon.

I do want to mention that I find that the half-liter bottles provide me with a better experience than the one-third liter bottles. I am not sure why. But it is something that I have noticed over the years. YMMV."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.13,"Very refreshing. A little citrusy, a little bready which some might think is a bit funky. Great wheat beer"

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.53,"Medium gold/orange, substantial white head.

Tastes of banana, cloves, bread and more banana. Perhaps some white bread dough.
Overall, so drinkable, this stuff goes down so easy.
American breweries just can’t do it like this."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.75,"Really great hefe. A favorite of mine. Weiss is my favorite variety of beer. but German Weissbier, US brewers cant get this one right for some reason."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,"What can I say. This is one of my favorite beer of all time. Perfectly balanced, high carbonation, great mouth-feel, refreshing but with a delicious banana-toffee like taste. Has that bit of Sweetness which is so good in Weissbier, but without becoming overwhelming like in some others. It also has a cloudy, delicious look when poured.

I should add, i've never seen this beer in a can, only in a flask here in Sweden.

One of the best beers i've tried, period. That is, if you like wheat beer - if you do not, i'd say, avoid it. Otherwise, grab your wheat-beer glass, pour it cold on a sunny friday and just enjoy life."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4,"""Freshest before 8/18/22""; drank 3/24/22 @ the Yarchives.

Soft medium mouthfeel.

Soft wheat & sweet banana flavors as well; it's simple, but tasty.

Never going to be my favorite Hefe, but far from the worst."
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,4.35,Bottle from John’s poured into tulip. Lovely strong banana/wheat/clove hefe.
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,5,Im my opinion most perfect German hefe ever produced! aroma of banana and sweet flavor of malt awesome every time!!
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.81,"4 pack purchased from Wegmans on 9/12/22. Poured from a 12 oz can into a stemless goblet.

L- Pitch black.

S- Deep roasted aroma, molasses.

T- Smooth, rich almost coffee like flavor.

F- Silky smooth rich almost toffee like
flavor.

O- A fantastic and approachable Russian
Imperial Stout!"
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.17,"Pours a glossy black with ample mocha foam that leaves lacing on the glass. The taste is heavy on the malts, with a sweet molasses taste and an undertone of coffee and light bourbon barrel oak. It is less heavy on char and more heavy on cola sweetness and that kind of chocolate flavor that the malt imparts. However, some roasted malts poke through on the aftertaste and strangely makes my throat tingle. The feel is medium and carbonation is fine."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.13,"L: Almost black pour, khaki head quickly fades to a ring no lacing.
S: Coffee, roasted malts, a hint of wood.
T: I get some burnt sugar, molasses, coffee a hint of licorice.
F: Thin for the style, carbonation is about right.
O: Damn fine brew."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.75,"12 oz can, vintage 2021, poured into a teku glass at 55 degrees F:
L - dark and stormy with a hazelnut head that lingered in great quantity
S - roasted malt, coffee, molasses
T - taste follows the nose, with a great dry finish
F - thick silky mouthfeel with light carbonation
O - very good RIS, blend of flavors is complex and robust"
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.25,"Brew: Voodoo Brewery – Big Black Voodoo Daddy

Intro: 12 oz. can poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Pitch black, Nominal head maybe 1.5 inches. Good lacing as I drank

Smell: Lots of roasted malts with bourbon barrel in the background.

Taste: Follows the smell. Good barrel presence .

Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation.

Drink: Easy drinker. Very enjoyable treat, well balanced and went down smooth.

Conclusion: Happened across this in the bottle shop and the name sounded familiar. Picked up a single just a shot in the dark. Was pleasantly surprised upon drinking. Would but another if I get back to the shop."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.06,"Only my second from Voodoo (the first was pre-Covid... worlds away)... I'm glad in this instance that I've had another. Voodoo's business plan is out of the ordinary on two counts (both missed in my first review): they focus on developing cool taprooms; and, they are employee-owned which is true only of about a dozen American micros that I know.
And being a Belgo-phile, I'm looking forward to finding Voodoo's Voodoo Love Child (a tripel.)

Aside from being the brewery's cash cow, Big Black Voodoo is good; but not exceptional in its style. It is good because it is understated and solid. It really doesn't Look like much; nor are its Smells much above the RIS average. Tastes are well-balanced, which is hard to achieve in high ABV styles known for lots of additives thrown in. This sits in my mouth fine, albeit not richly.

Bottom-line for me, I'm still looking for Love Child."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.1,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $13.99 if memory serves me well. Canned on 11/19/20, so this is just under 7 months old.

Look: Pours out a very dark brown/almost black and slightly viscous. A very tan colored head has all but dissipated. A bit of sediment at the bottom of the can (hop proteins? yeast?)

Smell: Lots of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee notes, secondary vanilla aroma. The aroma is a bit subdued; this may need a bit of time to warm up. A bit of alcohol on the nose.

Taste: Interesting. This is a bit sweeter than I expected. It's very smooth and flavorful. Up front, notes of cola, coffee, molasses, chocolate, and hazelnut. The finish has roasted malts, some smokiness, black licorice, and it is just mildly bitter. Very hard to believe that this is 12% ABV; there is a gentle warming in my chest as I it is very easy to drink this quicker than a sipper.

Feel: The mouthfeel is nice; it has some thickness to it, but it could also be perceived due to residual sugar. Below average carbonation, which is appropriate for an imperial stout like this.

Overall: This is a nice Russian imperial stout, and pretty impressive that it achieves 12% ABV without barrel aging and without adjuncts. To me though, it just isn't as complex and not as dry as I was hoping for in comparison with other Russian imperial stouts that I have had. It would be great if I could use this beer in an ice cream recipe. I think that this beer is very good now, and I'm not sure if it will improve much with age."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.03,"My bestie and I got a 4pck of this beer from the brewery in Erie, PA. It poured an opaque dark with an off white ring head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had bold roast with chocolate highlights. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with bold dark malt base and boozy flare. The mouthfeel was fuller in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,3.95,Good. Standard. Russian stout.
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.25,"From the 12 oz can in a snifter. This exceptional brew pours
a deep coal black with a very nice light brown head of foam that
settles to a thick ring, thin wafting layer, and sports some very
nice lacing. Nose of dark sweet chocolate, char, faint oak, dark
coffee, and subtle touches of cream. Flavors follow the nose nicely
with dark chocolate, char, brulee, dark coffee, and touches of dark
fruit (blueberry / blackberry) and is layered with warming lightly
astringent booze. Very nice mouth feel; full body, smooth, rich,
coating, medium light carbonation that supplies some very nice lift,
and a full, rich, and roasted finish.

Overall, a SOLID brew that is a great straight forward RIS.

Cheers"
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.04,"Earthy, iron, and molasses up front. We really enjoyed this offering at the brewery in New Kensington. Bitey, but not overly, sweet cocoa, raisins, and a heavy alcohol kick. 2020, September 11. Part of the Laurel Highlands Pour Tour!"
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.25,"Purchased during a trip to Ohio before the Virus.

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Very dark brown color with small beige head and good lacing. Dark chocolate smell and taste. Pleasant licorice and coffee flavors. Overall a very nice beer!"
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,3.99,Had at Alibi. Good stout with some sweetness (from barrel aging?).
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.21,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a nearly black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin khaki head that dissipates to patches with light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate, molasses and oak, a bit boozy. Flavor is dark toasted malt, licorice, light cocoa and molasses; oak appears in the finish which adds a little hop character and lingering licorice. Medium bodied with light creaminess. An interestingly different big Russian style stout. The licorice component is more forward than expected in this style, but added a lot to the flavor. There was distinct, high quality chocolate notes in the aroma, but only a suggestion of cocoa in the taste. The oaking is light but pleasant. Not quite to style for a RIS, but big, flavorful and enjoyable. Smells boozy, but ABV is well covered in the taste. I'd like to see this one again."
Big Black Voodoo Daddy,4.15,"12oz bottle. No dating information found.
Dark brown colored body with good sized medium brown back lit edge. Creamy thin head sticks around. Leaves a few bits of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a good punch of earthy hops.
Taste is cola like, with dark roasted malts, cocoa, a bit of char and coffee, and a good bit of hops. Low bitterness.
Mouth feel is thin but smooth. Okay carbonation.
This is a chocolate forward stout, with a good addition of hops, and the whiff of burnt caramel. Well hidden alcohol expression. The after taste is the most memorable aspect because all components get very condensed and dense."
Maman,4.7,"Look - black and thick with great lacing and a tan head
Smell - chocolate fudge with a slight spice and barrel
Taste - sweet chocolate tobacco boosy lots of barrel
Feel - pretty thick creamy slight carb
Overall - pretty solid"
Maman,4.34,"Pours jet black with thin mocha colored head on top. Smells of chocolate roasted malts and bourbon, subtle herbal spiciness on the nose too. The taste has a nice roasted profile, good sweetness that finishes with a touch of licorice. The feel of the beer is smooth, very silky. Overall an outstanding Imperial stout!"
Maman,4.36,"It was good, but not worth the hype"
Maman,4.53,"2019 poured from cellar temp on 6/17/2021

Pours a motor oil with minimal lacing. Nose of tobacco, brownie batter. Taste follows with rich chocolate, nice barrel, and some leather and tobacco. Feel is medium heavy with minimal carb. Overall, great!"
Maman,4.69,2018 version poured into a Morning Delight tulip. Saved this for my 51st birthday and what a treat. Wonderful no adjunct stout.
Maman,4.64,"Bottle. Dark brown/black pour with a chocolate head and an oily sheen. . Crazy fudge and chocolate nose. Wow, that’s legit. Bitter dark chocolate, caramels, dark roasted malts, mellow rye whiskey, oak, and vanilla notes. Complex, with a wonderful mouthfeel. Nice balance of sweet and bitter roasted malts. Good body."
Maman,4.86,"'20 batch.

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.

This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here.

This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.

It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially."
Maman,5,"I have to say I was blown away by the flavors in this. Deep dark fudge bourbon goodness. It’s a showcase of what the barrel alone can bring to the party. And what a party it is. Thick. Velvet smooth, vanilla, chocolate swirl. Wonderful."
Maman,3.91,"Based on the rating, I expected more enjoyment sipping this one. I got smokiness for some reason. maybe it was the bottom of the bottle."
Maman,4.99,"Tastes of rye soaked brownie batter, mouthfeel is pleasantly heavy."
Maman,5,"Batches vary from year to year. Served on draft at the brewery for 2020. It's chewy, fishy, barrel heavy and really enjoyable in small quantities. My only complaint is that it's served so cold off the draft line."
Maman,4.27,"Great BA non-adjunct stout. Did a share somewhat recently of 20 Barrel aged non adjunct stouts, and while this one was more hyped than most, it was middle of the pack. Dont get me wrong, very good, but worth the hype?"
Mexican Brunch,4.24,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino."
Mexican Brunch,4.57,"500 ml bottle poured into a teku

A- Black with a two finger mocha head.

S- Chocolate, cinnamon, some maple, coffee, some chili pepper, very well balanced.

T- Chocolate/fudge, coffee, maple syrup, some peppers, cinnamon, slightly earthy.

M- Smooth, creamy, full body.

O- A very well done and balanced molé stout. Easy to drink and a nice kick from the pepper even though it is on the more mild side."
Mexican Brunch,5,5/5 porter!!! Yessssss!!!! A+
Mexican Brunch,4.43,Smooth with hints of spice
Mexican Brunch,4.55,"750ml bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours a deep brown color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has good retention before settling into a ring around the glass

S- aroma opens with a heavy mocha cream notes from the combination of lactose and and cocoa, as well as an earthy espresso note that adds a bit of cracked pepper. Sweet maple, vanilla cream and rich chocolate. The close adds spiced notes of cinnamon and pepper skin, as well as more rich mocha espresso to close it out

T- earthy and peppery coffee notes up front are immediately complimented by sweet notes of whipping cream, caramel and rich maple. Mid-palate starts to develop a rich dark chocolate mocha flavor that carries into a finish that brings out cinnamon and pepper, with the pepper providing just a hint of heat. Lingers of espresso, heavy cream and chocolate

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky, velvety warming finish

O- all of the adjuncts work harmoniously with the milk sugars providing a perfect mouthfeel, outstanding"
Mexican Brunch,4.59,2020 vintage
Mexican Brunch,4.31,"Appearance - The poured a murky black color with a dark tan head.

Smell - The nose was rich sweet chocolate. It may have been a chocolate maple combination.

Taste - Chocolate really stood out in the initial taste. It brought to mind chocolate cola. There were also notes of coffee, maple, and a touch of cinnamon. I knew this was not Mexican Cake, but I expected more heat from the chilies. The rest of the profile was well balanced.

Mouthfeel - The feel was slick with sweetness and modest carbonation.

Overall - I thought the beer was tasty, but I expected a bit more. Mainly, it lacked spice."
IPA,4.25,"Yum, A refreshing and delightful IPA. Just the right amount of hops and a surprisingly light mouth feel. Tastes and smells like a well thought out IPA. The folks at Sweetwater have a winner!"
IPA,3.22,"Look...A copper brown yellow with a white carbonated head with no haze. With no born date just a BB date who knows how old this beer could be.
Smell...so light the hint of citrus and hop dank.
Taste...makes up for the lack of smell. A hop citrus juice. A definitive old school IPA taste. The heavy full and flavorful back end sets this up as a good one to throw back. a good full taste for a 6.3 percent ABV
Feel....Thin juice that is to be expected of a traditional American IPA. Medium carbonation with no lacing
Overall...A solid but not exceptional beer to me. Living in New England for many years, beers here tasted like this 20 years ago. With the age of the beers unknown maybe this would be better another time? It's Aiiiiight"
IPA,3.96,"A turbid amber beer with a long-lasting foamy head. A bread grassy peppery aroma that doesn't overwhelm nor stimulate the senses. A slight malty taste with little to no aftertaste, light, but not watery flavor. A pretty good IPA without anything to disappoint or overwhelm. An easy-drinking beer."
IPA,3.78,"Picked up a 12 oz single as part of a mixed sixer from the Ingles cooler on Spartanburg Highway 1-20-22 for $1.83. canned 9-2-21; consumed 4-25-22. Cold stored since purchase.

Beer poured golden orange with a very nice white head.

Nose is floral hops forward with a touch of grapefruit.

Taste follows the nose with a lighter pale malt base that has some grapefruit flavored hops and finishes pretty bitter with a nice piney bite; 8/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and fairly smooth and refreshing.

Overall a pretty good IPA that i would have again."
IPA,3.82,"This is my go to IPA. Great balance of hops and malt. Reliably consistent bottle to bottle, year around. Reasonably priced and easy to find in upstate South Carolina."
IPA,3.78,"L: Pours a hazy lemon yellow with a pillowy white head and nice lacing around the glass.

S: Very tropical lots of pineapple, orange, mango and some sugary sweetness.

T: Tropical fruit, pineapple, orange followed by a stronger hop bitterness, juicy but still old school.

F: Smooth mouthful, medium body.

O: This is a nice old school IPA."
IPA,4.09,"12oz can EB date 4/29/22 into a 16oz pint glass.
L: Pours a light sediment-hazed thick light amber gold w/a 2"" off-white rocky head with decent retention. Med-low carbonation and light sticky lacing. It's look reminds me of Firestone/Walker IPAs with fine sediment in suspension.
S: Citrus fruits, gently spicy hops, orange, mango, a hint of banana.
T: Citrus, pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, caramelized malts, a hint of bread. Bitterness lingers and hops are slightly resinous and stay centralized on the tongue.
F: Med-bodied slick & juicy mouthfeel with a med-length finish that is gently drying and lingering.
O: Good bitterness and balance and is fairly easy drinking even at at cellar temps. A straight up no-frills American IPA that is very good in it's style."
IPA,3.98,"Attractive clear amber appearance.
Around a medium body with carbonation that seems a little bit too much but still a pleasant feel.
Aroma is grapefruit, citrus, malt,floral earthy.
Taste is mildly sweet with a nice hop bite that doesn't dominate and take over.
Im not a big fan of ipas but this seemed to have enough of a malt taste to create a really nice beer."
IPA,3.42,"This particular beer is described as a ""go-to brew"". It pours a light amber with a white head. The nose is full of malt and hops and the taste is the same. My chief complaint is the mouthfeel is thin for an IPA. If you were planning a session or wanted something quick and easy I suppose this could work, but I'd have liked a little more body. Otherwise it's a fine beer."
IPA,4.13,"Clear, dark amber body; excellent carbonation; thick, sculpted head, white and sticky; lacing weaves along the glass. Nice dank, pine-like aroma with a bit of citrus. Nicely balanced taste; unobtrusive malt backbone supporting a moderate, zesty hop bitterness; pine resin; light esters. Medium body; crisp and slightly prickly on the palate; semi-dry mouthfeel throughout.

A very nice American India pale ale, clean, crisp, balanced and tasty.

Pouring temperature: 52 °F; canning data: 03/31/22 (best before date)"
IPA,4.28,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Clear gold, particles in suspension, big head.

Smell: Nice pink grapefruit aroma, some sweetness.

Taste: Mild sweetness followed by moderate citrus bitterness. Clean feel, dry finish, easy drinking.

Overall: Kind of an old school IPA here as beer #2 from the Sweetwater mix pack. I like it a lot, hits the right balance between sweetness and bitterness and is an easy drinker."
IPA,4.02,"Very smooth and bland but generally good flavors - sort of citrusy. No bitterness, soft feel, no real aroma to it oddly enough, not much head either. Reminds me of sam adams hazy IPA"
IPA,4.12,"Pours light amber with a 1.5"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing to the end.

Aroma is floral, citrus, pine.

Taste is mango, papaya, grapefruit, pine.

Medium bodied, lively carbonation. Dry finish.

This is a very good IPA."
IPA,3.63,"The pour is dark yellow. The taste is grapefruit, pine hop resin, & a mild papaya note. Cheers! B"
IPA,4.28,"Dated can is best by 4 months away. Rich, medium honey gold body, a nice thick 2-3 finger head, which slowly thins down a little by halfway and leaves good lacing . Appearance-wise, it's practically perfect.

Smells excellent, but words escape me for this. Very fresh and hoppy with some malt undertone. One that I love to schnoff on for a few good minutes of whiffage. Fruity , vegetal and dank and great!

Taste is excellent, with a bright overall hoppy vibe and enough malt notes to have some balls. Versatile and smashable, while still being crafted with enough dank hops to satisfy as a sipper. Quality brew, obviously.

Feel is just right for the balance of malt and hops. Really right.

Overall, it's one of my go to standard IPA's for the reasons above, and the Sweetwater mix pack 12ers are killer. Hell yes!"
IPA,3.91,"355 ml bottle, from the Norwegian importer. ABV is 6.3%. Deep golden colour, moderate white head. Pleasant aroma of citrus / oranges, also notes of flowers and spruce. Slightly dry flavour, grapefruity and resinous hops with a bitter finish, sufficient malts."
IPA,3.62,"Not great, certainly not bad. Plain IPA that unremarkable and easy to drink.
Though the date on the bottle is 11/17/19 and today is 4/25/21, so there's that."

Truth - Vanilla Bean,5,2/6/2021
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.25,"Pours onyx black with a dark brown film atop, which results in a small layer of lacing at the rim of the glass.

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel.

The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment.

Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.

This got an A+ balance to it with a truly fulfilling mouthfeel and a well working adjunct, establishing a nice interplay with the prominent barrel in this. Well done!"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.94,"31 May 2021 - Beer #245

Price: $18.00 at the brewery

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.

The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.

Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.

Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.

Taste: 5 - hmm, really interesting. Not too much vanilla. The barrel really hits on the back end.

Mouth: 5 - much thicker than expected. Supremely smooth. Incredibly well crafted.

Overall: 5 - okay, I wasn't blown away. Could have used more vanilla, but I'm nitpicking.

Cheers!"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.74,"This is probably only second to Good Morning in terms of stouts from Tree House. Luscious vanilla bourbon goodness that coats the tongue. This is rich and viscous, and as it warms the vanilla comes out. Each brewery has its own nuances, and this brew excels at showcasing the vanilla character, married to sweet and robust bourbon. Seek this out if you can!"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.83,WOW! First of all it’s great to finally have Treehouse barrel aging their beer. They jump right in with this one and it is as good as anything I have had other than KBBS. Kudos!
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.8,Full bodied...rich feel...sticky lace all over the glass...huge vanilla scent and flavor...mild barrel character and ridiculously smooth. Abv is there...a sure supper. This was really well made and am looking forward to more of their barre offerings if this is a hint of what is to come.
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.91,"Drank from a 12 oz. white wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a Tree House teku

Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.

The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.

The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.

Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.

Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy. I hope these guys continue to releases more barrel-aged bangers like this."
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.63,"I wish it had a bit more vanilla and roastiness on the nose, but the flavor is so exquisite that I forget all about it. It’s rich, vanilla frosting, creme brûlée, dark chocolate and finishes with oaky barrel char bitterness. It’s silky smooth, like all Tree House stouts, and there is no boozy burn. It’s the best Tree House stout I’ve had."
Truth - Vanilla Bean,5,"Lived up to expectations. Perfect blend of a fantastic tasty stout with just the right thickness and sweetness. Vanilla is just noticeable to bring great balance to the marshmallow and bourbon taste. The bourbon is noticeable from sip one and comes alive with that awesome bourbon burn on the tongue more and more as it warms - but never overwhelms. Always smooth, always a great mouth feel. Can’t wait for the next TH BA release."
Truth - Vanilla Bean,4.75,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (after 25 minutes of fucking with the wax thank you Tree House) into a stemmed harmony glass. Gotta keep it classy..

The pour is pitch black with a 2 finger effervescent milk chocolate head. The head quickly dissipates into a blanket of creamy foam. Doesn't leave any lacing but looks gorgeous after it settles.

The aroma brings notes of earthy oak, sweet bread, bourbon and vanilla before a wave of dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.

The flavor is definitely stupid. Lots of bourbon and vanilla on the front, followed by a tidal wave of milk chocolate, dark chocolate fudge, chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, caramel, sweet bread, and roasted coffee. There's some subtle notes of fig on the back. Wow.

The feel is about what you'd expect: Full-bodied and chewy as hell, creamy, syrupy and full of booze. One of the thickest beers I've ever drank. Ridiculous, but also extremely difficult to finish even a 12 oz pour.

Overall, this is the first BA stout I've ever had from Tree House, and...the 2nd they've ever brewed (not certain about that)? Regardless, it's pretty much what you would expect if you love TH stouts as much as I do. The bourbon is strong but never comes close to overwhelming the other flavors. Incredibly rich and full. The price point is hard to justify but it's absolutely worth trying if you can."
Flora,4.63,B7
Flora,4.46,"A: Retention becomes an accelerated rupture shortly after the discharge, which emanates a willowy throw-over. Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression. That initial onset categorizes those collared inches from Arabian Oryx to shredded coconut, before the unseating takes a painter’s knife to the pebbly brim. Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal. The output continues with intermittent transfers, which later transcribe hues in chartreuse, as shades of dim scarlet calmly intersect. During the walk, a growing classiness from air drafts of duration, which polish an engraving collar endowment with coupled calm clarity

S: Entryway is greeted by an involvedness preempted by esters, and a countryside funk that’s just setting off. In that regard, the indulgence stretches across citrus fruits with a ploughed rusticity that incises the herbed wheat kindly. The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather

T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases

M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish

O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locks"
Flora,4.5,I had the 2016 version which is a blend of Florence age for 18 months in a selection of wine barrels whose providence includes art and civil disobedience number 10. Very good beer.
Flora,4.23,"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a large foamy head. Aroma of funky Brett notes with some tartness, oak and light acidity notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of funky Brett notes, oak, tart notes with subtle acidic notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting saison with right amount of complexity."

Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),5,"They've upped the ABV in my bottle of 750mls.
Now at 12.5%.
Typical barley wine smell, heady, funky.
Quite sharp at first, then mouthfeel is excellent, crisp, but also rounded.
I am quite sorry that I opened this yet.
Can only get better.
Have another bottle.....gonna save it."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.05,"On tap 2011 vintage, so quite aged. Pours a tawny golden brown color. Head dissipated after a couple minutes. Smells like apple cider and brandy. Tastes like apple, caramel sweetness, brandy, tobacco, hints of tawny port, toffee, raisins, fig, and plum. Really mellowed out after a decade, it isn’t harsh at all."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),3.62,"2015 canning (8.4 oz can). Consumed at cellar temperature (~55° - guesstimate only, but a bit warmer if anything).

Appearance is dark orange, toward brown, slightly hazy with sparse carbonation. Very short off-white fizzy head with near zero retention; the head is completely gone with just a thin ring before I can put the camera down, and even this ring is gone before I can take a sip, leaving a tea-like appearance. No lacing.

Fruity aroma. Apple. Caramel. Toffee. Figs. Brandy. Quite nice.

The taste is a bit harsh. (Perhaps a 2015 is too young?) Citrus rind. Alcohol. Tobacco. Leather. Boozy. The citrus rind harshness lends a bit of bitterness and the tobacco earthiness is not a good counterbalance. The fruitiness (other than the rind) has not made an appearance. The alcohol warms my mouth and throat in the finish and aftertaste, with the tobacco/rind lingering.

Mouth feel has a moderate body and flat feel (no carbonation).

Overall, vastly disappointing, especially given the reputation and price at just under $1/oz. As I noted above, perhaps more age will mellow out the harshness. I regret buying two. The other one WILL remain in the cellar for more years, both to allow it to hopefully mellow out and because it will not be at the top of my list to try again."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.3,"I've wanted to try this beer for many years, but they are a.) hard to find, and b.) expensive. I finally bit the bullet and had two of these shipped from CA, along with more recent vintages of the Lagavulin and Sherry versions and a variety of other beers. $17.36 per bottle + tax and shipping.

Anyhow, on to my review. 9.3 oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2002 vintage. Slight hiss as the cap pops off - a welcome sign that there is still some life in this beer. Pours a muddy brown with a hint of red. Small amount of sediment. A hard pour yields a tiny head that quickly fades away. Aroma and flavor (which is very similar, but not as intense as the aroma) feature a complex blend of dark fruit, toffee, rich chocolate, Café con Leche, and bready malt. This is probably the smoothest 10%+ abv beer I've had, although you can still tell it's on the strong side. No hop presence, which is unsurprising given the age of this beer. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with maybe 10% of the original carbonation. Hint of slick viscosity, or maybe I'm imagining that because of how much this reminds me of aged tawny port. Overall, it's a tasty beer at 20 years and I'm looking forward to trying a more recent vintage to compare. I suspect that an example in the 5-10 year range would have a similar aroma/flavor profile with improved appearance and mouthfeel."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.52,"Vintage 2002 in 2022.

AROMAS of caramelized sugar, rye wheat, fresh baked bread, leather, warm paper, toasted wood, burned pipe tobacco, and prunes
FLAVORS of toffee, raisin, green apple, red wine, grape jelly, rock candy
FEELS syrupy, flat, medium body, light alcohol burn on the finish
OVERALL an immaculate beer after sitting for twenty years."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.25,Toffee and caramel apple on the nose. Taste reflects that giving way to a tannic almost umami finish. Raisins and nuts. Comparisons to Sherry are accurate.
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.45,"On tap at Windsor Brewing Supply in Anaheim, CA.
2012
Pours a slightly burnished gold to orange. Slight, sandy head starts off and quickly dissipates. Barely discernible lacing rolls down into the miniature ring.
Nose is lush. Caramel, toffee, apple brandy, orange marmalade, Tawny port, fig, and date.
Flavor washes all of the above listed notes around in a merry-go-round, slowly, musically, almost whimsically. Some of the notes show more complexity. The orange marmalade note really plays well with the Tawny port and fig. This really pulls me in.
Mouthfeel is medium in weight, low carbonation, and finishes slightly warm and generously sweet.
Overall, phenomenal. I've had it before, remembered it fondly, but I'm really happy to have taken the time to sit down, focus, and enjoy it deeply."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.49,"Here we are, the legendary JW Lees Harvest Ale. Huge shoutout to OEC for carrying this beer and a few variants of it. I’m not sure I would’ve found it anywhere else if they didn’t import it and bottle it. Anyhow, I have a 2 year vertical going with this one, between a 2020 can and a 2002 bottle. Holy hell, that’s the oldest beer I’ve ever had at nearly 20 years. Let’s get into it

2020: Pours a murky orangish brown with a finger of off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing
2002: Pours a murky deep brown with just a thin brown ring that leaves no lacing

Ok, in the nose alone, these are 2 completely different beers. Expected, but still kinda wild
2020: Sticky toffee, orange marmalade, biscuity malt, toast, wood, light piney hops, and a touch of general funk. It's surprisingly bright in aroma
2002: Super sweet caramel, chocolate covered raisin, brown bread, molasses, burnt sugar, and light whiskey. Super old but in a charming way

Just as the aroma suggested, these are totally different in taste. In a blind test I would never guess they are the same beer. The 2002 shows a bit of oxidation but not awful
2020: On the front end of the sip I'm tasting toffee, orange rind, bready malt, caramel, herbal hops, and a touch of lemon. The swallow brings notes of orange rind, sweet caramel, herbal hops, beechwood, toffee, and brown bread. Again, super bright
2002: On the front end of the sip I'm tasting medjool dates, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, and light cocoa. The swallow brings notes of medjool dates, fusel alcohol, sticky caramel, fig, old leather, molasses, burnt sugar, and light amaro. Crazy complex at this age, but I'm surprised there's some alcoholic heat to this one

2020: A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a shockingly easy drinking beer. Finishes off dry with a great balance between sweetness and light earthy bitterness
2002: A medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a super smooth beer. Finishes neutral and super sweet

This was a wild vertical. Personally the 2002 was a little too sweet for my taste, but it likely didn't have the best conditions for aging over the past 20 or so years. For an English Barleywine the fresh-ish 2020 is superbly balanced, honestly a perfect blend of English and American versions of the style. So yeah, my ratings are for the 2020, but the 2002 wouldn't be all that much lower since it still held up very well"
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.1,"2017 vintage poured into a tulip

Appearance - light brown colour with tan head

Smell - orange marmalade, caramel, tobacco

Taste - candied orange peel, caramel, orange marmalade, tobacco, apricot, fig, booze

Mouthfeel - full bodied, lower level of carbonation, upfront is the orange sweetness, sticky, boozy on the back end

Overall - nice barleywine here, nice flavors of orange marmalade dominate, its a sipper for sure. Try it.

Price point - $9.99/ 9.3 oz bottle"
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.2,"Look: It pours a caramel brown that is quite cloud with a tan head. Head retention is very good.

Smell: It has toffee aromas with some dried cherries in support. It has some orange notes with some vinous qualities to it.

Taste: It has bread and toffee flavors with orange and cherry like pipe tobacco notes. There are some low vinous qualities to it with some floral notes.

Feel: It has a full and somewhat chewy body. There is smooth alcohol warming in the finish.

Overall, a well done barleywine with plenty of flavor and it packs a punch."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.05,2014 vintage.
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.43,"2015 vintage. Rich sweet malt and caramel up front with fresh fruit - especially apple following. Has an alcohol taste but not boozy, fig and a very nice herbal hop bitter finish that's a bit spicy too. A real treat."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.23,"275ml bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. 2013 vintage.

Pours completely flat. Nose is classic for the style. Hints of green raisin, green grape, brown sugar, molasses, and maple syrup. Robust, rich, fruity, and very aromatic. Beer opens brown sugar, molasses, and maple syrup. Huge malt backbone. A hint of booziness in the back. I also get raisin, other dried dark fruit, and a touch of tobacco and wood at the finish. Big brown sugar on the finish. This is exactly what I want. Body is full with low carbonation. Thick, oily, and slick on the palate and goes down warm and slick with a long, lingering sticky aftertaste.

The classic brewer of the English Barleywine style does not dissapoint. A great beer worth trying."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.67,"2017 edition. 275ml bottle.

L: Pours a hazy golden brown. Similar to unfiltered apple cider. Short-lived ivory colored head retreats to a thin ring. This is basically the prototype for what a proper Barleywine should look like.

S: Sweet malt and rich fruit aromas. Red apple, plum, & Luxardo cherries. Vanilla, tobacco, and some leather floating around as well. Waves of cocoa, caramel, and burnt sugar.

T: Big sweetness up front. Dark fruit. Flashes of red wine. Chocolate, caramel, and hints of vanilla. Almost savory at times, but I can't really put my finger on it. Tobacco & leather make appearances late on. Finally finishes with a hint of tannic bitterness - just enough to keep some balance and avoid cloying territory. No real indication of 11.5% abv - no heat whatsoever. Really wonderful and complex.

F: Carbonation is minimal, but present. Mouthfeel is viscous and coating.

O: Really just fantastic all around. This is one of the standards in the category for a reason. Excellent stuff. Absolutely worth the occasional, or better yet frequent, splurge at ~$10/btl."

So moreish"
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4,"This looks a lot like the winter warmer I recently had. Same dark brown color with floating bits ! Some resemblance in taste too but this definitely has a wine like feel but not as fruity as real wine, obviously. Low bitterness. This is a 2016 bottle, drinking it in jan 2021, so it is roughly 4 yrs old. It is interesting, in a good way. Not an every day beer, but once in a blue moon, yea sure !"
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.78,"This is what a Barleywine should look like. This is what a Barleywine should smell like. And this is what a Barleywine should taste like. Straight up. This is the Elsa Hosk of Barleywines: you look it up and down, and you try and hide your woody.

I’m done."
Harvest Ale (Limited Edition),4.7,"2002 Vintage

L: Pours a dark burgundy with a minimal head that dissipates almost immediately.

S: Chocolate, cherries, raisins, caramel, molasses and light notes of tobacco and earth.

T: On the front I get sweet maple syrup mixed with dark fruit (I get raisin, plum, and light cherry notes). Mid palate the chocolate comes in hard and rides to the finish where it mixes with tobacco, dark earth, and molasses.

F: Full bodied, creamy, and sticky. Minimal carbonation and a bit of alcohol warming on the way down.

O: This is pretty much all one could want in a vintage English barleywine. Simply amazing."
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,3.95,"12 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!"
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.18,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.

The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.

The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.

Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".

Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done."
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.91,The Oak Aging just adds to the flavor of this already powerful ale
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.34,"From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The ""oaking"" process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste."
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,2.86,"**
06/01/2013

Aroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place. The pieces don’t come together here.

**"
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,4.6,"A- Probably the best write up anyone will come across on a beer bottle haha!! This pours with a great caramel colored head that is dense, starts off about a finger thick and has awesome retention. The beverage itself is muddied, brown and with plenty of visible suspended yeast particulate. The carbonation seems to be plentiful and smooth. As for lacing, it is really nice, with lots of small circular clumps of foam stickily hanging on to the side of the glass.

S- First impression.....wood chips, and of campfire! Beyond this there is vanilla, slight coffee and chocolate notes, some dense dried apple, caramel and toffee sweet malts and the finish is rummy sweet yet bitter from the hops....a very nice balancing act between rich & malty, oak, and bitter.

T- The flavors follow suit to the aromas, with the richness of the rum coming through very well....almost liqueur like. I am getting beautiful caramel/toffee sweetness, vanilla, oak cask, some campfire smoke. The bulk of the beer is yeasty, bread like, of cream, nuttiness.....just a full spectrum of balanced goodness!

M/O- Mouthfeel is creamy medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is about as smooth as one can get! I give this full marks for drinkability and I'd love nothing more than to enjoy more than one of these delectable Ales.....the alcohol is so well hidden you don't even know there is any.....what a delight to drink! Simply awesome and worthy of being one of my favorite beers!"
Fundamental Observation,4.23,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.

Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time.

The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex.

Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of."
Fundamental Observation,4.45,"Sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into my snifter. Received in part of my winnings for NFL BIF 33. This is a 2019 vintage with 13.55% ABV
The beer pours a black coffee color with a dense creamy beige head of 1 cm. This foam fades to a thick edge layer that creates some scattered lacing on swirls and sips.
Aroma is dark fudge, chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla notes and a little fusol alcohol. No hop presence on this aroma.
First sip is lighter body than I expected and smooth slightly creamy texture. Carbonation is soft and gentle and rolls easily across my palate. Easy drinking for a big boozy beer.
Flavor is sweet fudge and chocolate with hints of toffee and brown sugar. I also get bourbon and some vanilla and black peppery spicy heat on the finish. Again hops dont show up anywhere in this brew.
Im glad to have tried this one and like the flavor and aroma, I do think the beer could have a thicker body but that is just me. WOrth grabbing a bottle."
Fundamental Observation,4.65,"Ink black body, opaque; thick, frothy, sticky medium brown head. Incredibly rich and alluring smell; dark chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla. Amazing flavors; brownies; dark roast coffee; boozy; sweet chocolate; vanilla. Heavy body; rich residual sugar density; velvety and viscous; mild alcohol warmth tempering the sweet mouthfeel.

Wow! This is one amazing imperial stout. It's like a German chocolate cake with a low-key boozy edge. Dense with a rich complexity that brings joy with every sip.

Pouring temperature: 51 °F; bottling info: RELEASE 2022 BATCH *008*"
Fundamental Observation,4.79,"Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.

A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.

S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it.

T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla.

M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.

O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.

Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan."
Fundamental Observation,4.35,"The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention. This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range.

This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer..."
Fundamental Observation,4.57,"Viscous hell-black with ribbons of tan but no head retention.
Nose of fig, big thread of booze, some barrel, dark rock candy, espresso grounds and a big vanilla hit.
Fig jam, pastel de nata-ish vanilla pastry tart, root beer, bourbon, ash - but also rum-soaked chocolate cake - but also a ton of booze-soaked dried fruit - with a clean, char-less, roast finish.
Rich, full, chewy, round, dead smooth and NO BURN

4 4.5 4.75 4.5 4.5

Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…
That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”
4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over.
It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful.


All the hype is true. 2010 Vanilla BCBS is the only thing that comes close. Fantastic."

500ml bottle split between a pair of tulips. 2021 bottle, batch 007. Mine is labeled ""Imperial Vanilla Stout"" andthe label lists it as 14.0% abv. Received from @Beersnake1 in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14.

Pours black, very thick, no head, no visible carbonation. Smell is sweet milk chocolate, alcohol, roasty/burnt bitterness.

Taste is sweet chocolatey, lots of booze, vanilla, oak. Strong roast bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, with a small amount of grittiness. Overall, very nice beer."
Fundamental Observation,3.69,"Pours a pitch black. No translucency. A finger of mocha head arises and quickly reduces to a thin ring. Oily traces line the glass after each sip. Aroma is vanilla, coffee, chocolate, caramel and dark fruit. Taste follows suit, exactly. Feel is silky smooth. It is a good beer but very average for its overall rating on BA. I’ve had much better."
Fundamental Observation,4.63,"Pours pitch black, completely opaque and shiny. It appears thick and viscous. Thin, weakish, velvety mocha colored head fleetingly appears on the beer.

The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.

Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon.

Feel is thick, fuller bodied, smooth and viscous. Mild, soft carbonation, but it does not come across as under carbonated.

Overall this is absolutely delicious - an absolutely outstanding use of vanilla in a barrel aged stout."
Fundamental Observation,4.7,"Pours a deep black color with almost no head whatsoever. Laces the glass like a wine, I don't know what it's called, Legs? And They Know How To Use Them? Smells of sweet vanilla, smells like cake with a hint of bourbon at the end. Taste is incredible, not as sweet as I was expecting. It's sweet vanilla upfront followed by bourbon and then a nice deep roasted malt flavor. It's smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, warming. Excellent beer, Bottle Logic does it again!"
Fundamental Observation,5,"2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!"
Fundamental Observation,4.49,"2017 vintage courtesy of warmlager from Minnesota
Look: Black color fairly minimal brown/tan head. Minimum-moderate carbonation.
Smell: light bourbon, light vanilla, chocolate, wood.
Taste: vanilla, oak, chocolate, molasses, bourbon, maybe very slight oxidation.
Feel: medium-thin, smooth, very slight bourbon burn. “Booziness” well-hidden.
Overall: well incorporated vanilla stout with 3+ years on it. I heard the recent vintage was “not the same” so wanted to try one first that had a good reputation.

Taste has a harsh but pleasant coffee bitterness, dry dark chocolate, roasted malt with some smokey wood.
Overall an excellent beer"
Péché Mortel,3.5,light stout slightly creamy but nothing else
Péché Mortel,3.75,"Poured nicely.
Very noticeable coffee smell.
Too much. Doesn't taste like beer with coffee, tastes like coffee with carbonation. Overpowering.
Not to my liking."
Péché Mortel,4.44,"A magnificent stout with a bold in-your-face roasted coffee flavor. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle dated 2019.

Body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting.

The nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts. Very pleasing.

The body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness. Chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish.

Mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high ABV. The powerful flavor more than compensates.

Coffee fans must track this beer down. You'll thank me later."
Péché Mortel,4.19,"Pours black. Aroma is best feature of this beer. Incredibly intense coffee aroma with equally intense dark chocolate & roasty, smokey char. Taste doesn't match aroma. Tastes like I'm drinking strong coffee. That's it. Mouthfeel is way too thin for me."
Péché Mortel,4.44,"Drinking this fucker walking through Modern Day McArthur Park..if you know you know . It's like the 90s all over again here

Dieu De Ciel - Peche Mortel
Imperial Stout with Coffee.
No bottle date
Not a fan of their label rework at all but it's what's inside that counts right

Drinking it out the bottle so forgive my notes.
Nose is alll roasted coffee goodness, cacao nibs, semi sweet chocolate and dark malts. A bit on the sweeter side .
As with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor , semivsweet chocolate, cacao, dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness (coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all, very mild) .

Look: don't know.

Feel: as expected from non ba coffee stout. Lingers on the palate for a while and gives your teeth that 'drinking coffee' dry feel.

Overall : enjoyable no bullshit Coffee Stout.
Thanks @micada"""
Péché Mortel,4.42,"Bottled on 1/27/2022. Poured into a stout glass at 59°. It pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy, toffee-colored head and lacing. It smells of freshly-brewed coffee, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco smoke, and nutty char. The coffee in the flavor is strong, burnt, and acidic. It combines with baker's chocolate, burnt nuts, and earthy char and is as dry and roasty as they come. There is just a hint of chocolate and caramel sweetness but this is a bitter brew. The flavors are big and bold and it finishes with a strong dose of hop bitterness. Delicious! The mouthfeel is creamy but not quite as viscous as I'd expected. It's moderately carbonated and isn't overly boozy for 9.5% ABV. Overall, this is the quintessential coffee stout. I'd recommend against drinking it before bed if you want to sleep. I don't know why Dieu du Ciel doesn't distribute to northern New Jersey but now that I can find it in South Jersey or eastern Penna. I'll be sure to stock up."
Péché Mortel,4.31,"A - Pitch black pour with toffee colored lacing.

S - Intense chocolate roast aroma with some char and deep coffee aroma.

T - Coffee roast, char, deep chocolate malt roast all up front and ends with a lingering chocolate roast/coffee bitterness.

M - Full silky body with some slight thinness around the edges and very dry on the back of the tongue.

O - This is a Classic and fantastic Imperial Stout that never gets old. Highly recommended."
Péché Mortel,2.96,More chocolate than beer to me - nice bitterness - coffee comes through mid-back palate.
Péché Mortel,4.25,"11.5 oz bottle notched 1 0 2 (my research shows this is a batch number and means nothing) poured into teku glass at fridge temp 9.5% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with just a hint of light penetration around the edges. The head (or lack thereof) never fully develops and presents as the finest, razor thin ring around the glass. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is bittersweet coffee, chocolate and slight oxidation. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, there's not a lot of life left in this bottle. I wish this beer was still imported. I would try fresh given the opportunity. Scores are skewed up as this bottle was just purchased off a room temperature shelf this week and has clearly suffered."
Péché Mortel,4.56,"11.5 oz bottle, born on 9/18/19, poured into a snifter at 52 degrees F:
L - black with a hazelnut head that lingered
S - coffee, chocolate, roasted malt
T - very dry, malt flavor with coffee and a bit of chocolate on the finish
F - thick mouthfeel, very dry, little carbonation
O - Fabulous beer, very dry with strong bold flavors of coffee and roasted malt"
Péché Mortel,4.25,"Taste of dark roasted coffee is up front along with roasted malts that have a burnt-toasted character and a nice bitterness that lingers, but not too long. Nice imperial stout."
Péché Mortel,3.89,"341 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 9.5%. Black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of coffee, roast malts and dark chocolate. Rich flavour, but not too sweet, notes of roast malts and strong coffee, also plenty of bittering hops. Hints of dark bitter chocolate and unsweetened liquorice. Good beer, but not as outstanding as expected."
Péché Mortel,4.84,"WOW. This beer is really something special.
Looks like any other deep black imperial stout does. Beautiful black in colour with small brown head, leaves some lacing.
Smells like roasted malt with some subtle dark roast coffee. Very inviting.
The taste of this beer is amazing. Nice roasted malt, caramel malt, coffee, and some vanilla maybe in the back. Some chocolate notes and brown sugar are present as well and it's all very well balanced. I didn't notice any of the fruit notes other people have reported. I drank the bottle in like 2 minutes without even noticing so this is definitely a dangerous drinker.
The mouthfeel was quite pleasant and full bodied. Doesn't coat the mouth but has that medium-full body with light-medium carbonation.
Overall at $14 for 4 bottles this beer is insane. This is the best overall Canadian beer I've ever found and I love Dieu du Ciel. Such a great beer and huge recommend for anyone with access to it."
Péché Mortel,4.32,"Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good looking Imperial Stout.

Smell: Roasted malts, moderate coffee and some very mild brown sugar notes. The coffee and the roasted malts are the star here.

Taste: The taste profile features prominent coffee and roasted malt notes, and some very faint brown sugar notes. The finish is fairly dry featuring the roast malts and coffee notes lingering to the end. The beer has a mild alcohol presence.

Mouth-feel: Medium bodied with a generous level of carbonation. Not the thickest stout but it still has a good mouthfeel.

Overall: A good coffee stout. The flavor profile is that of a prototypical stout with a real roasted malt backbone plus a nice coffee presence. A good pastry stout is tasty but sometimes it's good to go back to the basics."
Péché Mortel,4.7,"Purchased based on a rave review from Foss Co. in Golden, an accolade to take very seriously. Still, at $5/12 oz I wasn't expecting something quite this ... exceptional. By appearance it's an average imperial stout, jet black with a thin tan head, but oh wow. The reviewer who called it ""something like hard cold brew"" pretty much nailed it. Delicately chocolaty and dark fruity, with a seamlessly integrated bitterness upon a clean but comforting body. An elegant palette of bold and beautiful flavors that never overstay their welcome. (By the way, hard cold brew does exist, and it's disgusting.)"
Red's Rye IPA,4.18,"On tap at founders

Pours an amber red with a one finger foamy white head. Smells of Caramel and biscuity malt, peppery rye, pine and citrus peel. Malty up front with caramel Notre, mid palate gives citrus zest and pine resin. The finish gives some malty sweetness with a citrus linger. Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and finish"
Red's Rye IPA,4.57,"Astounded that I have not reviewed this yet. It is the single beer that I have never fell out of favor with. Others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me.
Pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while.
The aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.
The taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip.
The feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.
OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.
Really good beer!"
Red's Rye IPA,4.04,"Pretty good rye IPA. Dark amber color with ample white head. Rye flavored IPA with nice flavor profile and few off-putting flavors. Overall eminently drinkable—not too bitter for an IPA, not too sweet. Well rounded and well crafted."
Red's Rye IPA,5,Best beer I've ever had!
Red's Rye IPA,3.75,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.6%, 70 IBUs. Reddish brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Nice aroma of floral and citrussy hops (dry hopped with Amarillo), also sweetish notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour has also notes of orange marmalade and caramel malts, but is not extremely sweet. There is a distinct hoppy bitterness towards the end, with grapefruity and resinous notes, lasting through the long aftertaste. Good stuff."
Red's Rye IPA,4.12,Pours a medium-dark copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is sweet with a hint of caramel. Tastes starts out slightly spicy and finishes with a good hoppy bitterness. Good mouth feel.
Red's Rye IPA,4.58,"This is my all time favorite beer, not necessarily because it's the best beer I've ever had, but for many reasons including sentimental ones, so I will try to view this as objectively as I can.

Poured from a Michigan exclusive release can into an IPA glass.

Color is deep caramel/red tones. Head is darker than a typical IPA and sticks to the glass like glue

Smell is peppery and malty, slightly sweet. Pleasant, not overly intrusive.

Taste follows the nose but much, much stronger. Peppery bite up front, followed by the sweet from the red ale characteristics. Finish is a lingering rye pepper flavor. Excellent and memorable.

Medium bodied, smoother than you would expect mouthfeel.

Overall, this is a delicious beer that is also interesting to drink. I'm so glad that they are packaging this beer again after a long hiatus, and consider myself lucky to be a Michigan native so that I can get this beer easily."
Red's Rye IPA,4.27,"12oz can courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the can, this was canned on ""03.09. 200019034."" Apparently, Founders has an in-house time machine, and this beer was retrieved from the era the Dune books are set in.

Poured into a Mad Bomber IPA glass, this had a nice, but, fluffy, beige colored head that sat on top of a dark copper, slightly red colored beer with some nice clarity. Said head took a long time to drop and left lots of lace behind.

Peppery, spicy Amarillo hop and rye malt notes greeted the workers at my olfactory. Some sweet, bready malt notes as well.

Taste is spicy and peppery up front. Earthy, Rye malt flavor comes to the fore especially at the fadeout. Fairly good-sized, bready malt backbone to this, which isn't surprising given it's midwest DNA, but is not sufficiently massive to be disturbing to a PNWer like me!

Medium bodied, with an almost creamy mouthfeel.

Really like this. If it were local to me I'd have it in my fridge on a regular basis. Thanks, Whyteboar!"
Red's Rye IPA,4,"From old, undated notes. Had this on draft.

Murky orange rust hue.

Tan head; minimal lace.

Skunky weed & grapefruit nose; hint of caramel.

Thick mouthfeel.

Grapefruit with a hint of caramel; viscous but enjoyable."
Red's Rye IPA,3.92,"Now I'm trying to figure out a blind tasting, courtesy of a @foundersasap in our NBS BIF #9

I am a little baffled by this one.
It's a garnet tinged amber color. Light sandy head that rises a finger or so, loosens up, and quickly recedes. (I'm assuming it would have a little more head retention had I opened earlier).
Really pretty color.
Smells of rye, some earthy hops, and a hint of caramel malt.
Taste is rye, buckwheat, a tad of pine resin, with a gentle almost floral honey note. Also a smooth pepper note peeks in.
Mouthfeel is slightly less than medium. Low carbonation. Finish is a tad slick.
Overall, I'm guessing a rye IPA, or an Amber ale with some rye in the mix.
So what is it?"
Red's Rye IPA,3.58,Sheesh I should have left this rating as original. as I was going over my notes from earlier.
Fundamental Forces,4.54,"For the 2021 version! Sweet and rich chocolate malty, hint of vanilla, and hint of bourbon barrel nose on this one! Taste follows with a dark chocolate bitter, floral vanilla, and balanced boozy bourbon finish. A slight hint of age/oxidation can be detected on the backend, but this has aged/settled in extremely well for being about a year old. The bigboi booziness that you would expect at 17+% is there, but it is smooth and enjoyable...it starts to peek out a bit more as it warms. And, the mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Outstanding!"
Fundamental Forces,4.51,"Look - black thick syrup with slight rimming and lacing barely a head
Smell - a lot of vanilla bourbon barrel chocolate and booze
Taste - lots of vanilla chocolate great barrel
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - really great beer"
Fundamental Forces,4.79,"Fundamental Forces is an Imperial Vanilla Stout from Bottle Logic. The one I drank had an ABV 17.17%, so a little stronger. I guess the Fundamental Force I got was the Strong Nuclear Force, the one with Gluons and Mesons. It's recommended with brownies. I didn't have brownies but my wife suggested oreo cookies but I thought that I didn't need to double it up. This beer is like 8 oreo cookies and that's enough. Maybe a little sweet, but it's good, very good, slightly boozy (well ABV 17.17%) but with all the other flavors that is not an issue.

Look: black with a half inch fluffy mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon

Flavor: What stands out is the vanilla, the bourbon, the roasted malts, the coffee and chocolate.

Body/Overall: Full bodied, dessert in a bottle."
Fundamental Forces,4.9,"#102, yummy and boozy!"
Fundamental Forces,4.5,This is a very very good stout beer. It is very boozy. It is very thick and rich so take it slow but you can sip and and enjoy as it is very strong but it is worth it.
Fundamental Forces,4.56,"Pours a deep black color with a nonexistent head leaving a thick lacing down the glass. It smells of huge coffee, sweet vanilla and bourbon aromas. Tastes of sweet vanilla a bourbon, hints of coffee at the end. Very sweet but excellent flavors. Thick, heavy, warms on the way down. Overall it's an excellent beer, very high abv so beware!"
Fundamental Forces,4.44,"Midnight black pour with a thin brown ring and webbing. Huge aromas of vanilla lead the nose, with fudgey chocolate, full bourbon with potent molasses mash, chocolate truffle, hints of marshmallow and light plum liqueur. Amazing in the potency and complexity while keeping vanilla a star. Taste is a relative disappointment, like FO without the impeccable that has the flavors meld together. Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration. Much warmer than FO too, feel is not as smooth or lush, but instead chewy. Still a wonderful stout well worth your time, but much prefer fundamental observation. The wife liked it"
Black Chocolate Stout,4.43,"8/10/22 Really nice Russian Imperial Stout. Perfectly balanced between chocolate, coffee, malt. Sweet but not cloying. Better than Ten Fidy? This could be the one."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.15,"Happy to try an east coast classic. Smell is sweet, lots of vanilla, some maple syrup, a bit of coffee, and a slight bourbon character. Taste follows- sweet and rich. Toasted malt dominates. Caramel, marshmallow, some piney hoppiness, bitter dark chocolate, and nutty coffee on the finish. Smooth drinking, and I can taste the alcohol. It lives up."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,"A stout to cherish: strong, bitter, excellent chocolate without usual sweetness — wish it was a regular year long."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.41,"Pours black with a nice tan head with some lacing on the surface throughout. Smell is roasted malt with some chocolate notes. The beer delivers on its black chocolate promise but without becoming cloying or gimmicky. The first few sips have a big spicy alcohol hit before it settles in and you get used to it. Nicely balanced between bitterness from the roasted malt, some underlying sweetness, with that black chocolate note throughout. Heavy and boozy although it's tasty enough to have a couple."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.11,"Winter 2019 series.

L: Very dark, tan head that fades quickly.
S: Boozy at first, before the chocolate comes in. Some roastiness too.
T: Lots of chocolate, some roasty malt, a little anise maybe?
F: Very smooth. Gets better as it warms up.
O: Underrated, somehow? The chocolate is very understated but it's a good balance of flavors and a pleasure whenever I get around to having one."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.75,"This beer is as close to perfection as it gets. Outstanding look, smell, taste and mouthfeel.
L: Opaque with a light brown head that leaves a lot of lace
S: roasted coffee licorice and chocolate
T: same
F: plush
One of the best Russian imperial stouts"
Black Chocolate Stout,4.34,"Ebony with a 1/4"" tan head, which dissipates. Light lacing.

Aroma is coffee, chocolate, roast malt.

Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, roast malt, licorice. Acidic.

Full body, light carbonation. Dry, astringent finish.

Outstanding! This is one Imp Stout to tyry before you die."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.43,"Poured black with a fizzy dark tan head that dissipated quickly to a thin film. Light lacing. Nose of light molasses, malt and dark chocolate. Initial taste of sweet malt and then an explosion of flavor from burnt toast, dark chocolate, oak and bitter black licorice lingering on the finish. This is a huge taste bomb with various layers. The high ABV is somewhat hidden. Moderate-light body with fine carbonation. Slightly slick with a lingering stickiness on the lips. Although I expected a slightly thicker brew, the overall feel is quite good. Sip this slowly and roll it around on the tongue to get the best experience. I would definitely buy this again."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.09,"Again, after many years, I try this brew. From the bottle, it pours a stygian dark black color with a nice light brown head that reduces and leaves lacing. Roasted and burnt malts in the nose. The mouth follows the nose, with some bitter chocolate as well."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.06,"Crisp, bitter, wouldn’t guess 10%, unlike many stouts at this level which ooze alcohol as well as adjuncts- none of those in this, relatively mild taste of chocolate and bitterness, coffee etc. very drinkable, for a rich 10% imperial stout. Really great, good for winter."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.54,"Appearance:
A full, two fingers of creamed froth the color of burnished beige that laces in slippery webs. This voluptuous head retains only a few moments before being swallowed up by the glossy blackness below.

Bouquet:
Smoked barley and charred baker’s chocolate are engulfed in a tremendous whirlpool of dark malts. As it airs, the barley and malts take a backseat as tremendous dark chocolate emerges from its charry cocoon, bold and unmitigated.

Feel:
The very definition of a stout: dense and full-bodied. Carbonation shows restraint, content with becoming lost in a warm, boozy, woodsmoke linger.

Taste:
Copious quantities of scrumptious, bitter black chocolate, subsumed by an avalanche of booze-drenched dark grains and black bread suffused with charcoal smoke."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.13,"Its an almost oozing thick dark ale on the border of jet black, with a warmly tinted head.
Dank notes of prominent tannins, vanilla, oak, and of course chocolate.
Smooth. Surprisingly light-bodied.
A maltiness and a dark chocolate bitterness, I honestly forgot it was a 10% but it doesn't surprise me.
Still a great offering."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.34,"12 ounce bottles dated DEC 2018. I bought it/drank OCT 2019.
Pours jet black, thin toffee head. First: quick black ale w/dark bitter cocoa pow. Second: raisins prunes and dates, booze, all dipped in bittersweet hop chocolate. Third: booze, light smoke notes. Hops and bitter cocoa go for miles- at least 01:45. Long lingering bitter darkness. It is excellent in every way."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.24,"On tap in a 10 ounce stout snifter glass.

Pours opaque pitch black color. The cap is dense dark tan, 1f, lots or dripping lacing.

Aromas of Belgian dark chocolate and cocoa powder. A note of vanilla as it warms.

Dark roasted malt and 85% cocoa dark chocolate flavors.

Full bodied with intense dark chocolate bitterness. The 10.1% abv does not hide itself.

Pretty much a straight up malt stout that develops a chocolate flavor. Very good."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.45,"A: opaque; very dark brown - almost black; less than a 1 finger medium brown head that receded to a thick, finely pored collar; very little lacing;

S: Ovaltine;

T: deeply roasted grain for a moment, then Ovaltine; moderately bitter finish;

M: full bodied; moderate carbonation; dry finish;

O: really, really good - don't know what else to say;"
Black Chocolate Stout,3.93,"Minimal head which is slightly tan in color. Moderate chocolate aroma. Certainly feels like a true stout, with strong malt flavors and a slightly bitter finish. Very smooth, with a good amount of carbonation. 10% ABV makes it a bit boozy. Not as much chocolate taste as I’d like, though."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.07,"My youngest daughter, who is much more of a beer drinker than her older sister, gave me one of these in a mix 6er at Christmas. She lives in NYC and it was a mix of local beers. This stout had very nice chocolate flavors and excellent mouthfeel, but it's very boozy. I think my abv cap is closer to 7.5, but it was interesting to try and it was a great gift."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.37,"2020 edition.
Pours black with small tan head, left no lacing and faded fast.
Smells really inviting. Nice dark chocolate with tons of roasted notes and some light vanilla sweetness.
Taste follows the nose. This is an awesome flavour profile. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, some coffee on the back, and 0 alcohol so this one’s a bit dangerous.
The mouthfeel is sadly kind of thin. Not super full bodied like what I expected for a big stout but it doesn’t ruin the experience. Carbonation is light and the finish is smooth and dry.

Overall, this is a really cool beer and I’m glad I got to try it. It’s balanced very well."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.32,"L:. Pours a dark black with a small tan head and no lacing on the glass.

S:. Sweet dark chocolate, a hint of vanilla, some smoke and ash, a touch of caramel and tobacco.

T:. Sweet dark chocolate, roasted malt, a nice touch of vanilla, and it finishes with a nice long lingering smokey roasted bitterness. Really like the taste of this.

F:. Smooth silky body, little lighter than expected.

O:. It's nice to have a normal imperial stout without all the crazy stuff in it, and this one is fantastic."
Black Chocolate Stout,4.41,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass

Look: Opaque black with a rich mocha colored head

Smell: Rich bitter sweet chocolate, burnt toast, and vanilla.

Taste: Big blast of semisweet chocolate, rye bread, vanilla, and oak up front. Then a body of cold brew coffee and chocolate.

Feel: Thick and coating. Covers the palate. Big bitterness. Medium alcohol. Smooth carbonation.

Overall: A great example of the style and one tasty brew."
Canuckley,4.9,"#131, yummy!"
Canuckley,4.25,"A: Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference. The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes

S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs

T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire

M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations

O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces"
Canuckley,4.43,"Brief Review:

O: Highly rated beer here from Transient, from my home state. Just got through Kentuckely, which I thought was just okay. Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer. Kind of a competitor to CBS, but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added. Gets a little muddled because of that for me. Little boozy and hot as well. It's a decent beer, I just wouldn't say it's that well balanced.

Recommendation: One of the better Transient beers I've had, but maybe not world class just yet."
Canuckley,4.46,"Vintage 2020 in 2022
Look - Black and thick with a nice light tan head great thick tan bubbly rimming and sticky lacing
Smell -bourbon barrel booze with a slight maple
Taste -great balance of bourbon barrel maple vanilla with nice slight coffee roasted malt
Feel -medium full body light body creamy
Overall - great well balanced with a ton of barrel. Not overly sweet and really nice"
King Sue,4.59,"Well-deserved hype for this one. Finally found it relatively fresh, canned 08/18 and consumed 09/22. Super smooth, delicious Citra all the way, and the IBUs hardly noticeable given the balance achieved. Hope I can find its siblings fresh as well."
King Sue,4.21,"Pours a hazy grapefruit yellow with a four finger head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma is orange, pineapple and a hint of mango. Taste is lighter than expected, very orange with pineapple mixed in. Nicely bitter but not overly so. There is a slight sweetness to the brew. Nicely done."
King Sue,4.42,It's just so wonderful and drinkable and sniffable and did I say drinkable. IT's great stuff and T Rex on the can is cool beans. My problem is finding it fresh. The store I usually go to has stuff on the shelf that's past the best buy date and I'm not spending 18 bucks on a four pack of 16 ozs. This same store was selling single 16 oz cans of 10 day old King for ten bucks. Perhaps I should talk to the manager.
King Sue,4.48,"King Sue Double IPA by Toppling Goliath. 7.8% ABV 100+ IBUs. This is really interesting…it’s got some bitterness up front and at the end but not nearly what the IBUs would indicate. Nice orange, mango and some pineapple in the middle with a little lemon or grapefruit at the end. Fair amount of carbonation as indicated by the head. Very nice lacing. Not quite the same color as the pictures on the brewery website…more pale golden yellow than the light orange on the website. Really good…."
King Sue,3.01,Can. Murky with lasting head and lace. Extremely fruity pineapple and citrus aroma with some raw dough. Medium sweetness buried under the juicy tartness with almost a hint a grain. Doughy full body. Lively carbo stops short of a bite. Juicy juicy juicy. A classic NEDIPA if you like that sort of thing. I don't.
King Sue,4.24,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Smells of bright citrus and floral hops. Tastes of citrus and floral hops, nice flavor. Beer is medium to full bodied yet easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
King Sue,5,"Love this beer
My favorite"
King Sue,4.5,Single can from Party Source
King Sue,5,"What can I say? Hop onslaught. Hop smoothie. Hopadelic. Hop juice galore. Poured into a snifter at 48F. Looks like straight orange juice with a fluffy white head that lasts forever. Smells like orange juice and white bread. Tastes of orange rind. Thick consistency that is somewhat filling. Alcohol is there, but not outstanding due to the level of hop intensity. Overall 5 across the board. Would recommend this beer to everyone who likes citrus anything."
King Sue,4.94,Best beer I've had.
King Sue,4.84,"Best New England style IPA I have sampled. Smooth, full of flavor and great mouth feel."
King Sue,4.66,"Super hazy/cloudy yellow/orange like pineapple juice with a touch of orange. The head is substantial, retains well and manages some nice lace.
The aroma is grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin with a hint of light caramel malt in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of Cara Cara oranges, lemon, apricot, mango and passion fruit, slightly sweet with a light malt background, balanced by plenty of grapefruit pulp and pine resin bitterness. The finish is dry with lingering pine resin and a white pepper note.
The body is full with moderate carbonation, smooth but with a fell of light pulp content even if not visible.
Altogether this is an amazingly tasty and enjoyable brew, everything is balanced for maximum impact that makes the ABV almost unnoticed.."
King Sue,5,Favorite beer right now.
King Sue,4.25,"On tap at the Irish River in Louisville. The color is like a mix of pineapple juice and grapefruit. And so is the nose. Very smooth hazy IPA. Not an overload of any flavor. Not even too boozy. Such a nice blend of grapefruit, tropical, and hops."
King Sue,4.83,"From Chicago and I've been drinking a lot of the weekly hop butcher which is almost always amazing, Phase 3's dipas, Microphone, Riverlands these stand out too. But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good."
King Sue,4.4,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage, Perkasie, PA. $22.50/4pk (16oz cans)

Pours a hazy, golden color. A one finger, white head on the initial pour that fades to a sticky residue on the glass.

Wonderful fruity, lemony aroma.

A citrusy, reiseny, slightly bitter taste. Slightly sweet. Very good IPA.

Medium consistency, medium carbonation.

My first brew from Toppling Goliath and I was impressed. I would definitely seek this out in the future. Cheers!"
King Sue,4.83,Had on tap at Glory Beer Bar & Kitchen in Philadelphia. This was a delicious New England-style DIPA with enormous depth of flavor and aroma. One of the best examples I've had of a style that I truly enjoy.
King Sue,5,Excellent
King Sue,4.46,"Full disclosure first: I'm usually not a fan of hazy IPAs as they are often too sweet, too murky, and not bitter enough for an IPA. But there are exceptions, and King Sue is certainly a great one. The look: King Sue pours with a beautiful white head that lasts, on top of an unattractive yellowish dishwater look. If you don't mind the murky dirty look, you'll be fine.

The smell is hoppy, classic Citra, with more fruity complexity. The taste is grapefruit and other tropical fruit flavors. It's less tart than some Citra beers. The big plus is that it's got solid bitterness as an integral part of the package. I don't like hazy IPAs that are basically alcoholic fruit juice, but King Sue is a real IPA, with bitterness and a noticeable ABV kick. This beer packs a flavor punch.

The feel is very thick, almost like a fruit smoothie.

Overall, it's certainly the best New England IPA I've had, with a standout flavor profile."
Triple Shot,4.43,"Canned 2/2022. I'm pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isn't, just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. The nutty, roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout."
Triple Shot,4.53,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.

Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.

Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge."
Triple Shot,4.38,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers."
Triple Shot,4.47,"House Blend, consumed 6/12/21
Pours incredibly thick for a non-BA stout, great feel. Sweet with a Big Chocolatey roasted coffee smell and taste. Definitely a “dessert” beer, and one that’s meant to be shared. Definitely a treat though, and probably one of the best non-BA stout I’ve had."
Furious,3.83,"Poured from a can. Caramel in color with a large tan head and some lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and caramel. Flavors are more towards the pine side with hints of citrus."
Furious,4.21,"First beer that I've had from Surly as I found this at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona while I was out there recently. Heard a lot about the Abrasive but this easily fit the bill as it was a wonderful IPA with a ton of body and flavor, as it nearly felt like an Amber / Red Ale!

Loved the chestnut hue to this as it was topped off by a *ton* of thick, bready head that stuck around and clung to the side of my pint glass, in the form of deep rings of lacing. A fine haze was in this as there was a ton of caramel, pine, and earthy hops in the nose with them being much stronger in the taste. Some herbal tea spice and bread rounded out the flavor as this was one to fly out of my glass quickly, as the carbonation was just light enough to keep this from feeling too heavy. Orange pith and deep earth emerged as this warmed up, as everything faded nicely once I finished this off.

This had a bit of booze, but nothing excessive, as it complemented the flavor profile quite nicely. Canned on 3/16, this looked and felt as fresh as could be with the impression of a tap beer that I'd easily have again. Loved this brew as it's easy to see why it's ranked so highly on here!"
Furious,4.42,"As far as IPA goes, this may be one of the very best. Strong hop, robust, not overly high ABV, clear (thank you), pine and herbal aromas."
Furious,4.72,"Used to be “scared” to try this when a buddy had me purchase this for him due to the price & ABV. First time I tried one, it knocked me on my a$$ but started to grow on me. Just enjoy in moderation…….."
Furious,4.07,"L: Pours a pale reddish-orange, an off white head, great lacing.
S: Resinous, piney hops.
T: Citrus a nice malty backbone.
F: Not quite thick, well carbonated.
O: One of the better ones...."
Furious,4.81,"As of late, I've been in an IPA slump--Nothing has been satisfying to my taste. I visited Duluth Minn. and stopped in to bar and had my first Surly Furious. WOW! What a lovely surprise. So much so, going back to baseline e.g., Two Hearted) is boring... I just want to drink another red Surly. It's the hoppy balance with a bit of bite (rye?). I live in Indiana. and wish they offered it in the Hoosier state."
Furious,4.35,"A tremendous IPA. It pours a deep amber color with strong lacing. Lots of citrus, with some sweetness like caramel or maybe butterscotch. And a truly smooth mouthfeel."
Furious,4.01,"Canned in October. No doubt the hops have shifted in their representation. Still an impressive hop forward IPA that pays homage to the left coast but establishes its on identity.

Huge head, tons of lace. Lots of pine and citrus What's really lovely is the Scottish malt base.

Nice amount of pine and citrus hits the nose with significant force. Good amount of biscuity malt.

Solid malt front is quickly subsumed by the huge hop component. Pine starts with a big and firm citrus follow through. Super clean and dry finish with a surprising amount of malt. Light hop oil.

Feel is solid and easy drinking. Solid carbonation and quenching swallow.

This reminds me a bit of the early West Coast IPAs like Pizza Port et al. Bigger and heavier malt backbone give it a distinctive personality. Hops are huge and all over this beer. A nice bookend to the other great midwest/heartland American IPA, Bells Two Hearted. Great overall brew. British malt, American hopping. Wonderful beer."
Big Bear Black Stout,4.04,"Poured from a 16 oz can dated PKG3/15/22. into the test glass
A - Cobalt black color, lovely, thick mocha cap, leaves ring after ring with each draw.
S - Burnt coffee, dark chocolate, a bit of orangey hop, mingles with piney hops.
T - Bakers chocolate, roast malts, molasses, pine, black pepper.
M - Leans toward the bitter through the experience, a bit of heft to the body, outstading dry finish
A - A very good American Stout, lots of body, excellent dry finish, hops are plentiful and balance well with the grain bill."
Big Bear Black Stout,3.13,"Sample from bottle, RBESG 2005 Grand Tasting in Copenhagen. Very dark brown colour. Malty and roasty aroma. Very roasty flavour, a bit too sweet for my taste."
Big Bear Black Stout,4.65,"California aside, this beer is amazing. It's thick yet easily drinkable. I discovered it at Spec's in Austin when looking for stouts. It has a great taste, nice brown color, goes down well. Pretty decent, California considering."
Big Bear Black Stout,3,"I'm not really sure why this is considered exceptional. Maybe as a stout, but not when comparing to thousands of other beers. Will not be buying again, but glad I was able to try a single bottle."
Big Bear Black Stout,4,Poured from a 12 OZ bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is a pitch black color with a long lasting brown head. The aroma is licorice. The taste is licorice and malt.
Big Bear Black Stout,4,"Heyo! We got a pretty decent one here, my peeps. Not flat like a runway model, not Coca Cola esque like a runway model holding a Coke... just pretty solid down the line. A lil chocolate here, a lil robustness there... not the best by any means, but aite."
Big Bear Black Stout,4.05,"12oz. Bottle Best By 7/27/2018, consumed 2/3/2018.

Poured deep dark brown, tiny head, minimal lacing.

Aroma seems a bit light, roasted malt, molasses, a bit boozy.

Taste fills out much more robustly with caramel, molasses, chocolate, roasted malt and brown sugar.

Mouthfeel is full, rich, great balance and very pleasant.

Starts slow but finishes strong. A terrific quality stout that's really affordably priced. The best combo."
Big Bear Black Stout,3.93,"Small pour at Rohnert Park location. Dark, muddy brown, small ring of beige head. Seems kind of subdued, but picks up the pace fast. Rich roast grains aroma, some chocolate. Taste brings the bitterness, gently, but enough to wake up the palate. Nice mouth feel, smooth. Bitter bite lingers."
Big Bear Black Stout,4.42,"Dark, pillowy brown head. Bursting with chocolate and malt aroma. Chewy, roasted malt taste with plenty of chocolate. Boozy aftertaste that is quite nice. Love how the flavours coat the tongue and the dry, roasted notes linger. Exquisite!"
Big Bear Black Stout,4.03,"From 32 Great Power. In Teku glass. Playing Green Cat. 5 months after bbf (my fault) Herbal hoppy notes like in a Black IPA, some vanilla and chocolate. Abv well hidden"
Titan IPA,4.04,"Poured a slightly hazy light orange amber color with a two finger white head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing. I suspect that the haziness is from being a few months past the can date.

Fruity nose with pineapple and citrus.

Malty flavor balanced with citrus and a piney finish.

Medium body and carbonation.

Overall, an enjoyable AIPA."
Titan IPA,4.4,"Light amber colour, pinapple smell and a bouquet of exotic fresh fruits with a bucket of IPA thrown in."
Titan IPA,4.5,"Good stuff, period. Theres a lot of IPA'S out there to have but as a Colorado boy, this is good stuff, great intro to the brewery. Nice balance of hops and citrus. Definitely one of the better ones I've had."
Titan IPA,4.78,can from BierPort in Pburgh - a good AIPA
Titan IPA,3.79,"Appearance was a ruddy burnt orange almost burnt brown color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Hops of orange, followed by a little less of grapefruit and pine nuts. Biscuit, bread malts add great balance. Really nice offering that I would buy if it was available here."
Titan IPA,2.01,"Poured from a can into tulip glass a huge 3F mid tan foamy head forms that settles quickly with loose lace from the top to bottom. Color is a coppery dull amber and is about 70% transparent.

The nose presents a nose that is vegetal as in produce department variety, with just a bit of an off note that I can only describe as veg decay, bong water or over fermented mash. It hints that I am going to be hit with a somewhat dank malty hop bomb.

Big slightly toasted malty mash on the palate with a dry danky bitterness. It starts lightly sweet and smooth on the tongue with a fairly strong toasted grain vibe and ends with lightly dry finish with a danky bitterness. This dank is nowhere as near offputting as the nose.

Mouthfeel is medium with a round slickness and warmth to the taste. Carbonation is light and bubbles are fine. Some alcohol tang on the end .

Wow, what an odd beer. The nose really is doing me in, some bong water mixed with beer is what I get. Not good. Taste is another matter as it is decent yet I cannot enjoy it because you have to breath. Maybe I got a bad can but it is still less than 2 months old. Perhaps it is the type of hops used that turn it a bit too dank for me."
Titan IPA,3.77,"**
11/19/20

Can to snifter. Canning date 4/9/20. A bit stale but will try it anyway.


Look: bright clear orange. Hint of brown. Head is creamy and khaki colored with excellent retention.

Aroma: 50% pine. 30% biscuit and cracker, 20% citrus.

Taste: piney-er version of jai-alai. Biscuit and pine build throughout. Light citrus.

Feel: a little sticky, medium body. Medium carbonation.



Impressed with how well this holds up at 7 months. Just enough sweetness to carry some east coast into a predominantly west coast ipa.

Titan IPA,4.4,"A classic AIPA, just made right. The up front taste brings a bit of malt and the finish has the hoppy bite expected from this style. My first and quick second in quite a while, I'd forgotten how good this beer is."
Titan IPA,4.35,"Pours a beautiful amber with a 1 inch thick, foamy orangish-white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end.

Aroma is floral, orange, pine, sweet smelling.

Tastes of orange zest, grapefruit, papaya, pine, spruce, resiny, malty.

Medium bodied, lively carbonation. Semi-sweet, bitter finish.

Outstanding! One of the better IPA's"
The Broken Truck,4.56,"Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head.

Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness.

Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness.

Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great."
The Broken Truck,4.9,"#103, good stuff!"
The Broken Truck,4.67,"Bottle courtesy of chardlogic.
1/21 bottling.
#7 batch I believe.
Label states blended from the last four years.
Really great blend. Tastes like an authentic aged gueuze from one of the Belgian masters."
The Broken Truck,4.6,Solid beer - great balance to everything. Also great color to this beer and amazing offering. Looks like straw and has a dankness. Tastes like Belgium from Oregon.
The Broken Truck,4.29,"It poured a hazy peach color with a foamy white head. The nose is earthy, musty and very floral with notes of lemon and melon. The taste is surprisingly bitter with heavy notes of grapefruit pith. Minimally sour but still has that lambic funk with a cider quality and mild lactic acidity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink.

Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side."
The Broken Truck,4.16,"7 February 2021 - Beer #227 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade
Rank: #86 on Beer Advocate

Appearance: 5 - looks a bit like apple juice. It's as clear as can be with a lovely, fluffy white head.

Nose: 4 - smells just like The Lily. White wine. EXTREMELY funky.

Taste: 4 - weird, it's actually kind of bitter. It's very sout, but it's got this vinegary quality to it. Good, but not amazing. Like a fine gueuze.

Mouth: 5 - bubbles galore. Impressive how it doesn't feel overly carbonated despite the bubbles.

Overall: 4 - tasty, well made, but odd.

Cheers!"
The Broken Truck,4.54,"Really awesome and complex offering from De Garde. As a member, this beer is one of the ones I most look forward to each and every year. Absolutely worth seeking out."
The Broken Truck,4.56,"Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket.

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.

The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.29,"From pint can marked PKG 07/06/22 16:09:32

Pours into my tulip glass a turbid opaque pineapple juice shade with a creamy bright white head. Fluffy sticky lace.

Scent is pineapple, grapefruit, mango and citrus with some pine resin.

Taste is tropical fruit - mango, papaya, pineapple. Citrus - lime, oranges, grapefruit. There is a hint (just a hint) of pine resin. Some green melon. Seems like a touch of alcohol esters.

Mouth is oily and heavier than medium.

OK, finally tried this reasonably fresh. Very good. Would I rate it 100? Nope. But certainly a very well made and delicious double IPA."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.99,The head is amazing. The juice bomb look is usual. The smell is amazing. The taste is amazing and bitterness righteous. Canned 07/06/22 bb 11/03. I felt fortunate to find this on the shelf at my Total Wine. Covid took a toll on my taste buds and IPAs are tasting differently but this beer is amazing. The juicy beer bomb is extremely tasty. The mouthfeel has some bitterness with all that juice and this is just amazing beer. Never pass it up. $22 4-pak
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.25,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Bradford's in Plymouth for about twenty one dollars. My twenty sixth brew reviewed from these guys. Solid brew, but a step below the OG King Sue, and a bit too pricey."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.37,"a: super hazy burnt orange copper color. a hint of creamy yellow in here as well. poured a 1.5 finger off-white head that fades pretty quick

s: orange juice, tangy pineapple, tangerines. creamsicle, passionfruit, and lots of kiwi. some sweetness and peach ice cream

t: oranges, and loads of pineapple. creamy mango sorbet and a touch of raw hops and alcohol. some sugary sweetness that tastes like caramelized orange slices. some honey crackers in the background and a kiss of peach.a little bit of guava in here too

m: super fluffy, medium mouthfeel with a bit of sugary stickiness. carbonation is moderate

o: very solid beer here. I think this boarders on NEDIPA territory with some of the sweetness it's giving off. it's very well-harmonized and quite smooth, even though there's a touch of raw hops in here. Not sure I'd score it 100 here, but it's delicious and dangerous. aroma could pop a bit more too IMO"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.19,"Hazy, pale yellow, very good head retention to slight veil towards end. Creamy smooth but with very nice hop bitter finish. Incredible mouthfeel, Highly drinkable."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.75,"Pours a hazed straw/gold with 3 fingers onf eggshell colored head/ Good head retention & very good lacing

S: Splenty of tropical fruit, cantaloupe, peaches & citrus

T: So follows the nose, green melon, much dryness, pomelo up front. More dryness, pomelo, lime && green melon, plus passion fruit as this warms, just a little cream sickle as well. Finishes dry with passion fruit, guava & pomelo

MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation & great balance

Super drinkability, lives up to the hype!"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.6,"Had on tap at Blind Tiger Alehouse. Pours a nice cloudy yellow color with a thick and medium bodied white colored head that leaves some nice lacing down the glass as it fades.
Smell is of sweet citrus, hop, melon, and some toasted malts.
Taste is excellent, much more balanced that I was expecting. Big citrus and melon flavors balanced out by a very good toasted malt foundation.
Feel was excellent. It was smooth, pretty crisp, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall an excellent beer."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.3,"A solid beer! Looks, smells, tastes and finished like a champ."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,3.14,"16 fl oz pull-tab can:

""Double India Pale Ale."" ~$21 USD per 4 pack plus tax.

Leans too heavy into tropical territory for my taste (think warm pineapple and dried mango), yet still lacks the assertiveness I'd expect in a true IIPA. A bit warmly boozy to boot, lacking in the drinkability department compared to something like Pliny the Elder or Exponential Hoppiness.

Not Toppling Goliath's finest effort, nor is worth its hefty ~$5/can pricetag - but it's a decent brew for what it is. Not better for not having been filtered, for what that's worth.

C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.46,"Pours a hazy yellow with a tall long lived fluffy head and a lot of lacing.

Smells of slightly dank grassy hops with citrus and pineapple.

Tastes of tart grapefruit, lemon, pineapple and honeydew melon with a lightly styptic hop bitter finish.

Medium light body with light prickly carbonation. Brut mouthfeel.

This is an edgier take on the classic King Sue. Tarter and bitterer but still juicy complex and drinkable.

Well done!"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.27,"16 oz can.

Pours an opaque pale gold color with a large, sudsy white head. Incredibly stubborn retention hides a ring of lacing along the top of the glass.

The aroma has loads of fresh orange, lime and grapefruit, as well as passion fruit, mango, melon, and pineapple. Subtly dank and herbal.

The flavor follows the nose with a hefty dose of citrus, then some pineapple, honeydew melon, overripe mango, passion fruit and a slightly bitter, earthy finish.

The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth with a dry finish.

Overall, this is a great DIPA. I'd say it's about on par with the OG King Sue, with a slightly more harsh hop bite and a bit more dankness."
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,4.34,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (0% clarity) medium and bright orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 7. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong aromas of ripe orange, cantaloupe melon, mango. Aromas is sweet. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange, citrus flower, sweet cantaloupe. Some pineapple, with a slight burn/bitterness off the end. Finish is sweet. (4.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A lingering burn/bitterness off the end. Suspect from the hop burn. (4.00)

Compared to TG Original King Sue 8/3/22: Pours similar color, milder head. Stronger aromas. More citrus flower and pineapple.

Compared to Welwerks DDH Dino Bits 8/13/22: Pours a lighter color, stronger head. Stronger aromas. More orange flower and mango. Less orange, cantaloupe, hop burn. Softer and smoother.

Compared to Phase 3 DDH Pixel Density 9/21/22: Pours an identical color, similar aromas. Similar citrus, pineapple, and tropical flavors. Slightly more juicy citrus and citrus flower. Slightly less green fruit. Lighter, cleaner, and slightly more astringent and dry.

Overall: Take a World-Class NEIPA and dry hope it. It's going to be what you expect. Absolute perfect haze. All of the same great Citra hop flavors from the original King Sue, but with extra hoppiness. The dry-hopping is detectable. It gives it a slightly extra fruity flavor, but with a pronounced burn/bitterness note from the dry-hopping. The original King Sue drinks like a wonderous and creamy NEIPA. This one drinks like an intense NEIPA that is in your face. Slightly preferred the original. (Rating: 4.34)"
Brown Shugga',3.58,"Local beer store had this as a single and I took a chance. First of all, I couldn't find any dates or date codes anywhere on the bottle.

Poured cloudy brownish color with a tan head. The smell is sweet and almost of a maple syrup. The flavor is sweet and has a warmth boozie feel. A decent beer, if you like sweetness in your beers. Not my kind of beer but hey, it was a one off shot."
Brown Shugga',4,Pours a hazy amber. Thick foam. Malty aroma. Big flavors. Bitter hop body followed my syrupy malt sweetness. Light brown sugar finish. You can taste the alcohol. Complex but well balanced. An excellent strong ale.
Brown Shugga',3.25,"12oz bottle

One of my old favorites, this is a big boozy sugary drink with a decent scent and look, and dangerous drinkability. I used to get sixers of this for $8 back in college, and many a blurry night were spent in its embrace"
Brown Shugga',4.43,"A nice seasonal option when I can find it. Decent nose, goes down smooth for a heavy hitter. I hope the woke agitators dont cancel the brew's name. Reminds me of darker skinned gf's back in the day. Much respect for this ""brew of color."" lol"
Brown Shugga',3.87,"12 oz bottle pours a deep reddish-brown in color with a beautiful creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in the glass. Strong aromas of grapefruit and caramel candy. Full bodied with a thick almost syrupy mouthfeel. Sugary, dark fruit and caramel flavor."
Brown Shugga',3.89,"Wowser, this is a pretty stout Am Strong Ale!! For me, it is is a bit overpowering with the initial bite and then the finish is a bit bitter. It is a really good beer for this style, but I cannot say that I find it to be a great beer. I know that is weak but that is just due to my taste. As always, I recommend you try this (if interested in the style) and form your own opinion."
Brown Shugga',4.02,Pours a copper color with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. No discernable aroma. Tastes of brown sugar. Starts out sweet but finishes with a hoppy bitterness.
Brown Shugga',4.09,"Bottling code from September 2019

Dark translucent copper, one finger of beige head, clumpy lacing. partial cap, variegated bubbles.
Caramel, dates, dark honey, spice cake aromas
Light hop tart orange citrus, pine, yet also brown sugar, and caramel flavors
Substantial body, alcohol noticeable, initial hop bite, but nice balance that drinks too quickly. Lingering hop tingle. Carbonation dissipates steadily but is stubborn given the ABV.
Evergreen standby in the winter months."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.13,I guess i just dont like limbic. I respect them for how zippy/refreshing and vibrant they are but I can just never seem to appreciate their flavors. I suppose this is actually a good thing because it probably saves me a lot of money.
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.5,"750ml bottle, caged and corked. Label has bottling date as '21 SEP 18', and a best before date of '26 OCT 38'.
Clear, medium gold colored body. One finger of white head sticks around as rising bubbles replenish. Slight strings of lacing.
Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.
Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.
Mouth feel is light and substantial at the same time. Bubbly, and high in carbonation.
Excellent balance in its blending, and a pleasure to sip."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.8,"Sipping through a 18/19 bottle in early 2022. Pours a murky gold with lots of carbonation. Sour funky hay and fruit on the nose. Heaven in a glass! Taste pleasantly sour, complex fruit with a bit of funk. RIP Armand"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.55,"Frustrated. Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying.

Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.

Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet.

Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!

Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.

This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.49,"Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip. It's not big, bold, or brash, instead developing an endearing personality.

Vintage 17|18, Blend n23. Bottling date: 07FEB18, consumed and reviewed 12March22. 375mL bottle into a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.42,"Season 17/18; Blend No. 81. Bottled 10/3/18; drank 3/9/22 @ the Yarchives.

Cloudy orange appearance.

A slow pour yielded a small white head; no lace.

Tangerine, lemon peel, spring water & faint barnyard funk notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Orange peel & barnyard funk flavors up front; a pleasantly tart lemon note on the finish.

Elegant, balanced & tasty. I'd have another!!"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.26,"375ml, bottling date 1/25/17

A: pours a deep burnt orange with a couple fingers of frothy tan head that faded away into a thin bubbly collar with soapy lace.
S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes.
T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste.
M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years.
O: I had to pop a bottle on the day of Armand’s passing and felt this was a good fit. A lovely beer, just like the lovely man I hear Armand was. Fuck cancer; rest in piece."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.57,"Pours a cloudy opaque brownish tinged orange color. Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.

The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.

The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

Overall its a remarkable beer - delicious, complex, challenging, yet oddly drinkable. A fitting beer to carry the name of Armand Debelder"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.5,"375ml cork and cage bottle poured into a tulip
Bottled 10/12/2015

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

S- bright and fruity nose with aromas of ripe pear, green apple, lemon peel, orange marmalade and white grapes. Plenty of funk undertones provide aromas of oak, barnyard funk, wet hay, fermented apples, leather and cracked pepper

T- fruity notes of ripe pears, green apples, lemon pith and citrus zest up front, followed by a backbone of funk, providing notes of hay, lemon tartness, yogurt and some barnyard funk. The finish is fruity and funky, with notes of more pear and lemon, funky linger

M- light-medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that finishes foamy and dry, just enough tartness lingering on the mouth

O- incredibly complex yet so drinkable, outstanding"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.34,"Pours a clear orange/yellow color with a light weight head and lacing. Smell is funky i with white grapes,hay ,grass lemon and wood. taste follows nose with the addition of light vinegar ,apples ,wheat and lemon grass. Loads of flavor layers as it warms. Mouth feel is slightly tart, with some spice a pleasure to sip."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.81,"Large bomber, bottled Jan 2019, opened 12/26/2021 at ~50 degrees F and poured into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip.

L: Pours a lovely clear burnished bronze-gold, and forms a thick, fluffy white head with great retention.

S: Funky, mildewy old dried hay, with sourdough biscuits being baked nearby, and some moldering orange peels.

T: Sharply tart underripe citrus opens, with a soft metallic tinge. That quickly segues into a swirl of sour white grapes, vinosity, green apple, and rancid honeydew melon, with a grass and mildew undertone. Old wood and pollen manifest by the finish, the aftertaste of which lingers as tart sour orange with mold and metal.

F: Verging between light and medium, with moderate carbonation.

O: This is a delight, as is the case with most 3F offerings."
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.44,"One of my Thanksgiving beers!

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful clear orangish yellow color with brief head and good lasting lacing. Wonderful smell and taste of tart apples and pears. Dry white wine. Flavors open up with a bit of warmth. Orange marmalade and hint of honey. Some pepper spice and herbal notes at the end of the glass. A special beer!"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,4.93,"It just doesn't get any better than this. Deep-flavored lambic while also maintaining its delicate profile. Vintage was 2017-2018, consumed in late 2021. Clear gold color with a thin, yet long-lasting pure white head. Lacing doesn't quit. Very champagne-like in flavor--tastes range from white grapes to citrus to oak, with a bit of funk. Sweet up front, with a semi-dry finish. This is some special stuff, quite possibly the best geuze I've had. Save it for a special occasion, but make it an annual purchase because every year brings new qualities."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.12,"L- Deep chestnut, and has poured beyond hazy, this has small chunks floating around despite the bottle being rested for days and poured reeeally slowly - so it seems pretty major sediment is inevitable/by design. Pours with 5mm off white head, half of which still exists when I finish the glass 15mins later.
S- Milder than anticipated, some caramel and a sense of richness. I thought I got a hint of mild/sour cherry on an early sniff, but never managed to get it again.
T- There is a small dose of sourness on the front here, then the flavour opens out immediately - boom! It's big, pungent and deep. It has a sweet note (in parallel with it's overall richness), something I rarely favour but here it's balanced by the sour. It's deep well-roasted pungency make this a super winter-warmer type of beer. ps Late on I suddenly get a 'Hang on, is that a blackcurrent note coming in!?'... maybe, fleeting.
F- It's quite a mouthful, pungent, intense, more suited to colder months as a slow-sippin' winter warmer beer. All rather wonderful.
O- I think this is absolutely superb. How they balance the sweet + sour is very clever, it's so fine-tuned. Overall the whole hangs together really well; there isn't anything at all that I note that's 'wrong', or out of balance.
Updated lable on bottle: Now entirely modern, almost a bit 'urban/gritty', a stencil/graffiti design in white black and purple.

Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.08,"Bottle at Coriasso's, served in a trappist glass. Pours a brown colour with red tones to the light, medium head with short retention, crying lace.
Aroma of prunes, coffee, caramel, chocolate, I think I feel some notes of tobacco, spices.
Full body, thick in the tongue, good carbonation. Sweet finish.
Taste follows the aroma.
Very good one."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.59,"Brown to yellow colours,
Lots of Carbonation, fair amount of sweetness and candy like tastes.
I like it"
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.21,"Pours a murky chestnut color with some red hints with a medium top of beige head that dissolves slowly.
Aroma is pleasant with notes of dark and dried fruits like plums, raisins,prunes, figues, caramel,bread, dark malts, red berries,spices and smoked woods.
The taste is sweet with notes dried fruits and with a strong malt profile in the background. I sense hints of caramel, bread in the flavour as well. The finish is slightly dry still with the malt profile strong in the background. Great strenght and lenght in the aftertaste. The flavours are balanced very well, and the alcohol content hidden very good. Mouthfeel is silky and oily with a medium carbonation and a medium body.
A very nice example of a belgian strong dark ale. Very enjoyable."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.34,"Purchased in March 2018,750ml bottle for $6.20 from the LCBO. -- great deal . Bottled Dec. 2017--One year old. Poured into Westmalle chalice at 11c. Nice cola head no lacing. Kinda boozy but in a nice way Goes very well with chocolate mint candy."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.84,"We have a live one! Careful when opening, very active. This is going to sound gross, but trust me it is not: the taste is prunes and raisins combined with cola and yeast. Like I said, trust me, the taste is very enjoyable, though admittedly not the most deep. In fact the depth is a little short in the nose too and especially in the body. Want more because what they have is good"
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.07,"Deep brown and cloudy with lots of fine bubbled carbonation, and topped with 4 fingers of beige head.

Smells of candied prunes, coke, banana, dark fruits and caramel.

The taste follows the nose but is more intense on caramel, toffee, dark fruits, banana, and Belgian yeasts.

Medium to thick body with loads of foamy carbonation.

Got this at LCBO, drinking on a rough Lake Rosseau, June 2nd, 2018."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],4.25,"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red-orange with ruby notes and a one finger khaki head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of candi and dry caramel malt, plums, dark red berries, dates and raisins. Flavor follows with dry caramel malt, fresh and dried plums, dates, raisins and a little caramel in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and a good mouth feel. Flavor is a classic mixture of Belgian dark malt and dark fruit, this Brune is a bit drier than some of the other Belgians in this style, giving a little bit of old ale malt flavor. Fruit and malt are rich and well balanced; well supported by the creaminess of the body. The rich reddish color is much nicer than the Brune name suggests. Alcohol well covered. A very nice Abbey style dark ale and one I will watch for again; it does not come to our market very often."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.77,"750 ml bottle, served fairly cold (at least a little colder than recommended) into a Gouden Carolus chalice. Batch appears to have been tested, this ticks in at 10.3% ABV per LCBO testing. Best before September of 2019 and purchased for about $8 CDN if I recall correctly.

Appearance - Up[on cracking the bottle a geyser of foam and froth rushes to the top. Pouring into the chalice yields a murky roan colored beer and a half finger of dense tan head. It burns off very quickly and a plethora of bubbles rise to the surface. Not the most graceful entrance.

Smell - Sweet malty goodness with yeast, brown sugar and candi sugar prevalent. Suggestions of raisins and cherries in behind barely concealed by a strong boozy presence.

Taste - A touch hot an boozy initially, making way for brown sugar, marginally overdone caramel and molasses. More bitterness than I expected, but that helps keep this reasonably balanced.

Mouthfeel - Very fizzy, to the point of being overzelaous with it. Body is medium-heavy and finish is very dry.

Overall - A pretty good dark and strong Belgian ale, but flavor-wise doesn't provide as much as the likes of Rochefort, Chimay, Van de Kaizer, and St. Bernardus and the fizziness is cumbersome. Still a pretty decent brew. Will revise this review as it warms as that may provide greater perspective.

EDIT - Continued to drink this at is warmed and other than the carbonation fizzling out, not much changed. It does pack a punch, so I truly believe the 10.3% ABV as per LCBO listing."
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.97,"The weaker sister of St. Bernardus, Westvleteren and Rochefort, this shares some of the characteristics of all of them. You really can't go wrong but don't expect as much. Even Chimay Blue is more superior. It is somewhat cheap, mind you, so I guess it's a decent alternative.
The only thing I didn't like, is that as soon as the cap is removed, the beer oozes out uncontrollably, so you have to pour quickly. Never happened to me before with a brew that's been sitting at cool room temperature for about a week.
Anyway, enjoy!"
Abbaye Des Rocs [Brasserie Des Rocs Brune],3.85,"Pours a chestnut brown with a full three fingers of head. Head is slow to break, some lacing, and a cap and collar.

Smell is dark fruits, quite figgy, and then there are the Belgian yeasts and finally there is a nice dark sugar/treacle smell.

Taste is similar to the nose, with dark fruits leading the way. A touch sweet. There are some mild spices in there and that treacle comes through. Surprisingly the yeasts are quite muted in the flavor.

High carbonation is the lead on the feel. It is medium in body and the booze is actually well hidden. Finish is wet, if that is possible.

Not a bad beer, but not quite up to par with the big boys in this category in my opinion. For example, I wouldn't say this holds a stick to a Chimay bleue or perhaps Van de Keizer Blauw. At just over $6 for a 750 ml bottle, I'll forgive this though."

Jam The Radar,4.17,Raspberry tootsie pop.
Jam The Radar,4.5,"2021 Release

Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with purple undertones. The beer has a modest sized dark beige head, that also has some purple undertones which faded fairly quickly to a nice ring. Nice looking Imperial Stout and the purple undertones are a nice touch..

Smell: Prominent raspberries, moderate Bourbon aromas and brown sugar aromas, and mild roasted malts/coffee aromas. The beer has a good nose featuring the raspberries.

Taste: The palate features raspberries, moderate bourbon notes, modest chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced and while the raspberries are very apparent all the flavor elements work well together. The beer starts off fairly sweet but dries up a bit. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 14.56% ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation that results in a nice mouthfeel for this beer.

Overall: Another well done Bottle Logic stout. The taste profile nicely balances all the flavor elements resulting in a very cohesive taste profile. Very nice."
Jam The Radar,4.37,"Look - fantastic black with a great tan head

Overall - pretty tasty"
Jam The Radar,4.42,Great mouthfeel and body. This beer is a real treat with a nice fruit forward flavor balanced by slight bitter and bourbon notes.
Jam The Radar,4.56,"Best Raspberry stout around. There are a few different batches, some more Raspberry while others have more barrel. Ymmv.

Best fresh witjin a year or so. Not for many years.

Very satisfying."
Dead Guy Ale,5,"Delicious for an American maibock. Was not a fan of rogue beer, but this one is delicious, I recommend it, 6.8 and bitterness around 30. Smooth and doesn’t get yoy drunk !!"
Dead Guy Ale,3.26,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle
Glass: 0.5L Pokal
Pouring Temp: 50.6 F


Look:
Deep and slightly hazy copper with an initial 2-finger creamy light beige head. The head dissipates to a thin but consistent cover with excellent soapy lacing down the glass.

Smell:
Tons of sweet bready malts laced with honey and either toffee or caramel. There is also a subtle earthy note along with hints of floral hops.

Taste:
Starts with bready malts and toffee then a strong earthiness asserts itself and dominates the taste. A light bitterness also appears alongside the earthiness and grows throughout the sip.

Feel:
Smooth feel. Body is medium with a slight lean towards the lighter side.

Overall:
A nice beer full of strong but balanced flavors. It reminds me of an ESB more than a Maibock, but regardless, it is a solid brew.

My ratings reflect how the beer smells/tastes/etc as a Maibock.
If this was categorized as an ESB my ratings would be more akin to the following (give or take):

look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 | overall: 4
Combo: 3.94"
Dead Guy Ale,4.45,"L: classic dark whiskey colored beer, light white head. Looks like it belongs on a postcard.

S: gingerbread malts, a little alcohol bite, sweetness, and dark fruits.

T: follows nose, feels very Christmasy. There some pineapple in there too but it’s so well blended it’s hard to tell. Something just stands out I’m not sure what it is.

F: medium- full body. Not heavy, just says hello.

O: felt more like a winter beer than a spring one, but happy to try and enjoy it. This is a local brew and the style isn’t represented enough where I live otherwise I would have tried the style years ago. This nails what I imagine a classic winter/spring hearty food ol beer would taste like."
Dead Guy Ale,3.89,"Canned 3 months ago on 10/19/21
Poured into a shaker, small head that thinned out quickly. Minimal lacing, glass might not have been beer-clean. As seen in at least one other review, honey-colored is the best color descriptor. Rising effervescence.
Smell is malt, floral and apple
Taste is semi-malty with slight grapefruit bite
Feel is okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. Bitterness balances the taste and feel.

Hard to rate this one. I wish the ""Overall"" rating carried more weight here. Each individual attribute is better than mediocre, but the sum of its parts is much better than one might think if considering each aspect individually. It's a good, solid, well-rounded tasty beer. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but if I was at the store and on the fence about what to buy and saw it, I'd remember, ""Hey, that was a good one"""
Dead Guy Ale,3.4,"Poured a cloudy golden color with a thin white head and moderate lacing.

Tastes of sweet malt, a little caramel but overall very light."
Dead Guy Ale,3.5,"Haven’t had this one in like a decade. Floral notes, caramel and bready malt. Light grapefruit and lemon. Fairly sweet but nice mild dry floral bitterness on the finish. Solid balance and drinkability."
Dead Guy Ale,3.9,"Neah, neah... nope"
Dead Guy Ale,3.36,"Everyone keeps saying that this is heavy on the malt. I was expecting a nice malty flavor but was greeted with something a little more akin to an IPA due to the heavy addition of bitter hops. Beautiful honey color and a sweet smell on the pour. I am not an IPA fan, so this wasn’t for me- however, I liked this better than other hoppy beers."
Dead Guy Ale,3.83,Very good ale.
Dead Guy Ale,4.16,"Pours a beautiful murky caramel. A few fingers of tan bubbly, foam rises and recedes to an off white ring leaving soapy lacing. Nose is green apple, honey, and sweet malt. Taste is honey, oak, roasted malt, biscuit, grass, and lemon. All melding together perfectly to create a truly delightful masterpiece. Feel is silky smooth and very full. Love this and will buy more."
Dead Guy Ale,3.87,This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.
Dead Guy Ale,3.57,"Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style.
Smells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good.
Tastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock."
Three Philosophers,3.98,"L - Poured from a 16 oz. can into an oversized wine glass. Pours a dark brown with reddish hue in the light. Has a tan one finger head. Head quickly dissipates to a ring. Had definite clear alcohol “legs.”

S - Scents start with light malts before dark fruits. Some booziness at 9.7% ABV. A little sugar scent.

T - The dark fruit and specifically cherry flavors are front and center. The alcohol is up front too. A little more bourbon like.

F - Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is cola-like.

O - Overall, this is a quality beer that I recommend trying out. It’s higher ABV is very apparent while drinking and for that reason I don’t think I’ll add it to my regular rotation. Also the cherry flavoring sounds good in theory, but I don’t prefer it in practice. I enjoy other straight-forward Belgian Quadrupels more than this one."
Three Philosophers,4.68,"Opaque reddish brown (colorblind, so best guess) with plenty of sediment. Thick off-white head that dissipates quickly with no real lacing to speak of.

The aroma is rich, tend towards cherry, and dark dried fruits. Sugar, burnt sugar. Moist earth, loam, and wet wood. Cola. Phenolic spice. Buried in there is a creamy oatmeal like aroma, trending towards nutty (like steel cut oats with almond milk). There's also a bit of cocoa powder hanging around the edges.

Taste is faithful to the aroma, just bigger and more intense. It leans heavily toward cola, even having a similar lingering sweet bitterness. It's almost bourbon like (Knob Creek), but too chocolatey and bitter to do more than insinuate a connection. The finish is rather prune like, and slowly fades to a lingering bitterness of hops and cocoa powder. Alcohol is apparent, but in a pleasant way (again, like with a good bourbon). As it warms, you get more fermentation funk (in a good way), and malty sweetness.


There is a lot going on here. Each sip is different as it warms. It's like a journey in a glass, and it's well worth taking. Delicious beer."
Three Philosophers,5,"The pour and the head is spectacular and very aggressive (quite a head; don't over pour or you're sure to waste some). The aroma of that first pour, especially into a chilled/frozen standard beer glass, is not to be missed. Everything there on out is just as enjoyable right up until you have to decide: ""Shall I have another?"""
Three Philosophers,4.35,"Pours the typical plum color with a tan head, it looks like a quadruple or a strong ale. Smells like cinnamon, raisins, with a whiff of alcohol. Tastes like cinnamon, raisins, sugar, malty, with a little burn. Not quite as good as the Belgian standards but it’s a tasty beer and has it’s own personality, cheers!"
Three Philosophers,4.19,"Surprisingly (to me), the head is short and very short-lived, despite as vigorous a pour as I could manage in the small 250ml chalice. While it lasts (look quickly), the head is a light tan color and bubbly. It quickly shrinks into sparse islands (and, then, also fairly quickly, disappears altogether), leaving a tea-like appearance. Dark reddish-brown from the front becomes a hazy bright ruby with a backlight. Active carbonation (also short-lived, though) rises to cause the islands to swirl around a bit. The color is great looking. Unfortunately, that is all that is great about the look.

Nice aroma, strong at first (I picked it up as soon as I cracked the can) but becomes pretty weak once the head is gone. I had to swizzle it to get a good whiff. Dark fruit, sweet candy, cherries. (Since I could tease an nice aroma with a swizzle, I didn't penalize the ""smell"" rating due to the limitation of the head - that was taken care of in the ""look"" rating.)

The flavor is very nice. Dark fruit, of course, sweet sugary candy, cherries-slightly tart. Spicy - coriander, perhaps some clove. No bittering. The middle exposes a malty foundation lending some needed gravitas to the beer. The interplay of the flavors never actually blends, but they do play off of each other very nicely. This is an excellent-tasting sipping beer, with lots going on in the flavor to keep me interested. The alcohol comes through into the flavor at the ~⅓-point of the beer and lingers through the remaining time. The finish is - oddly - a blend of sweet and dry. The candy bringing the sweet, and the cherries bringing the tart-dry.

The body is thinner than I expected for such a strong beer, and the feel is flat despite the initially active carbonation (which, as I mentioned above, seems to have disappeared along with the head). The feel ends up being a bit annoying (that is, for a flavor that is so great, there is a feel is so meh).

Overall, this beer might have among the widest variation among my rating of the individual elements (3.25 to 4.5), but the ones that count the most are the highest, so overall, it ends up at a weighted rating of 4.19. But, somehow, a bit of a disappointing 4.19."
Three Philosophers,4.74,Intro description is pretty accurate. Heavy on the dark dried fruit. Feel and head is abbey style. Not a go to beer but def worth indulging. Seems a good winter holiday selection.
Three Philosophers,4.08,"Hazy light brown body, with a fizzy head. Smell is deep and sweet; roasted malt, caramel, raspberry, pepper, hints of spice and esters, a bit of chocolate. Taste is also fairly sweet; immediately comes the spice, with coriander, and pepper; orange peel and citrus too, followed by a strong malty backbone. The kriek comes out on the finish, with cherry and raspberry that add a sweet balance to the upfront spice. Fairly high carbonation, and the ABV is quite noticeable. This is bigger than I expected, and while I very much enjoy the complexity it comes off a tad unbalanced."
Three Philosophers,3.94,"Three Philosophers pours a medium, cloudy brown beneath an off-white two finger head. Actual chocolate flakes do float about the bottom of the glass, the cherry ale lightens the color and eye appeal of this brew. Chocolate, cherry, almond and sugary notes create a parfum more admirable for complexity than actually enjoyable. The taste is perplexing. The chocolate and cherry flavors stand apart, rather than melding. Hops, malt, and an overbearing fruit sweetness collide to create a delicate, fussy, overthought delight, with a saccharin mouthfeel aftertaste, much like marzipan. I never understood the appeal of marzipan. Pretty much the same here. I get the mission, I sense quality ingredients. It just doesn't ring my bell."
Three Philosophers,4.23,"As I scroll down the reviews, I see a lot of variation. This one's a dark amber, lots of sediment, which ain't a bad thing. Prune, cherry, and tang (not the orange juice) are noticeable first, then a sticky thickness. THEN the alcohol (again, not a bad thing. Notes of bread on the back channel. I had a 4-pack a while back and forgot to review, enjoyed it then and now. A lot like an unsweetened thick cider that's fermenting to alcohol instead of vinegar."
Three Philosophers,4.32,"Appearance: Dark brown, tan colored mousse-like head, tight compact bubbles with excellent retention.

Aroma: Yeast forward, bubble gum is prominent. Caramel. Dark fruit.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol noted. Some chocolate notes mixed with caramel. Faint, mild cherry flavor. Dry start to finish.

Mouth-feel: Light to medium bodied, high carbonation.

Overall: Demonstrates quite a jarring bite between the higher ABV & high carbonation. Gets your attention. Label mentions cherries, but that's pretty well hidden in there. But, as you drink it, you start noticing the tart, sour finish. Highly effervescent. Visually, it promotes a lengthy, creamy looking head, more so than most beer styles. I'll admit, this beer is not my normal cup of tea. But, it's interesting and a nice change of pace. Not quite sure where it fits into my seasonal/regular beer routine. Well worth a shot."
Three Philosophers,4.43,"I cannot believe Ive never reviewed this beer! I used to drink the 750 corked and caged bottles of this beer on the regular!
Tonight I have a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter.
The beer pours a rich mahogany color with deep garnet undertones when held up to the light. A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling.
Aroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point.
First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now.
Flavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV. Even with this bite, the drying finish encourages me to take another sip, which gets me to emptying my glass much to quickly.
QUite a nice beer that Im glad to have revisited. Definitely a classic and one I will gladly drink again."
Three Philosophers,4.38,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Teku glass. Deep mahogany in color, fluffy white head, slowly receding. Watch that pour because this guy will get a little out of control. Scents of raisins, dates, prune juice and red wine. Flavors of baking spice, oak, brandy, dark cherries, prune, fig. It’s funny, I’ve been drinking 3 philosophers for years now but just realized I have never rated it. First time I’ve tried it from a can- no discernible difference from bottles but I also haven’t tried them head to head. I do appreciate the pint vs ~12 oz volume though- basically the same price between 4 cans and 4 bottles but going to have a nice buzz on by the time I’m done drinking a pint! Maybe the best Belgian style beer I’ve had from the US. I always like to pick up some of these when the weather starts getting cold and reminds me of decorating the Christmas tree."
Three Philosophers,4.18,"For my money this is as good as an American Belgian style beer can get. I tried this for the first time about 10 years ago, somehow never reviewed. I saw it in the local gas station in Delhi NY, about 30 minutes from the brewery. I knew nothing about it, but it was the only craft beer available, so I bought a six pack (well truthfully I also bought a sixer by Saranac, but that is an entirely different story). Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much. When I poured the first bottle into a goblet, it had a billowing three finger frothy head and gorgeous brown color with ruby highlights. Next I discovered a pleasant cherry and malt aroma. Then I had the first sip, and I couldn’t believe my taste buds. Cherries, plums, raisins, molasses, a subtle bread-like yeast, and a nice malt backbone. I took another sip, and it was just as good. Somehow the beer I bought between the Miller and Bud at my crappy local gas station was clearly a world class beer. I had previously lived in Colorado, and enjoyed New Belgium, but this was better! These days Ommegang is nationally known because of its Game of Thrones beer. But 3 Philosophers is truly the one and only king of American made Quads."
Three Philosophers,3.9,"August 13, 2021 - Opaquish dark copper color, nice cream color head slowly recedes to a cap, and then to a ring, no lacing; A noticeable aroma - citrus tangy, fruity; Mouthfeel is quite good; The flavor is odd, and leaves a yucky aftertaste? Well, let's see if it grows on ya. It is robust. And sour, but not too sour, but it has a bad flavor I can't name. I do not like it.

August 20, 2021 - Second bottle much better. Whatever that bad taste was it didn't recur. So its not bad. The 9.7 ABV is quite noticeable, not in the flavor, but in the effect. So I must have gotten a skunky one before. I raised the score for taste and overall."
Three Philosophers,4.36,"Poured from a pint can into a pint mug

L - Clear amber in color. Substantial light tan head three-fingers thick which settles to a complete and persistent layer. Lacing is present thanks to the thick ring of foam along edges of the glass though the head is so thick it takes a while to display. Looks like a glass of honey.

S - The cherry aroma is at the forefront. Very strong and sweet. Malt of brown sugar/molasses on the backend. No hops to be found. Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.

T - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.

F - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this. Probably best to drink this one on its own. You won't have much room for food otherwise.

Ommegang really delivered on this one. Will definitely get it again."
Three Philosophers,4.31,"Look: I believe this appears to be the quintessential Quadruple Ale. Deep amber liquid with a creamy yellowish head that tames down to a thin foam layer with nice lace on the glass.
Smell and Taste: Roasted malts and cherries.
Feel: 9.7% ABV is a perfect setting for this brew. Leans toward the high end on the carbonation scale but it's not overbearing.
Overall: Got to stick with the taste grade on this one. A very good Quad."
Three Philosophers,4.12,"Pours a hazy prune juice color producing 1.5 inches of tightly bubbled, very short-lived, light tan head that leaves little lace. Aroma is vinous with notes of cherry, caramel malt, brown sugar, something medicinal and a hint of alcohol. Taste is cherry tarts, plum, caramel, yeast bread, dark fruits and red wine with the medicinal note heaviest in the sweet, almost syrupy finish. Alcohol spice and warmth throughout. Complex, strongly flavored and heavy bodied with low carbonation."
Rouge (Red),4.31,"Popped a big thick 750mL tall brown bottle. Deep amber to the browner end of copper, it pours hazy with yeast and unfiltered goodness and a foamy two and a half finger head that recedes into a spotty cap with thick, clinging ring of foam around the glass. Large bubbles pop up, not in a line, just one by one, from the ethereal dark brown bottom.

Malty, sweet, caramel, yeasty esters on the nose are primary. Doughy and bready, and you’d be forgiven for smelling banana. Particularly good amount of spices, cloves and cinnamon. Little bit peppery but the general character stays to the sweet side and reminds mostly of that.

Flavourful and pleasantly balanced profile, not as strong as their other beers. This can easily be a plus or a minus depending on what you want from your beers. Deep savoury yeasty esters that border on doughy but are more restrained interact with the sweet caramel malt and gentle toasty flavours that never border on cloying. Clove and peppery spices present here. As for fruits, I get a lot less dark fruits than others do. Plum and raisin might be present, but they taste fresh and gentle, and banana is just as present. Maybe it’s the foamy carbonation giving it a lighter touch on my palate or something else. The alcohol is well hidden which likely adds to the lighter character that gives a more spicy-light phenolic touch that leans towards lighter flavours rather than deep raisiny-fig-pudding ones. Definitely some molasses here though.

Medium-ish bodied with a higher level of carbonation, the finish is barely touched by any hops or buttering presence and is lightly sweet, again, not cloying. Bready malts with a touch of yeastiness stays on the palate, and mild spice character reminds, the light pepper impression of white peppercorn and the sweetness and spice of cinnamon, light vanilla, and currants. The good carbonation level and tendency to highly foam when it hits your tongue gives the taste palate a unique spin that is a bit lighter and very nice, it’s not quite creamy or smooth but sort of a merge between them both. I chalk it up to the great way this beer blends palates and tastes.

Ah dubbels, the interesting beer that’s not between, but occupies little spaces between a doppelbocks, Belgian strong dark ales, and Tripels. Hard for me to localize how it fits, and my palate is unrefined, but I try! Chimay Red mixes things together that arguably comes out in a perfect cohesive blend. What can I say? I love malt, sweet, spicy beers. Definitely an excellent offering from Chimay, their Blue still my favourite, but this is as good or potentially better than white? Have to try both again. All the Trappist beers are just delightful, and the yeast is great for my stomach. Excellent beer to round out my 100th review!"
Rouge (Red),4.37,"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Dark brown thick light tan head on aggressive pour. Minimal lacing. Has alcohol legs

S - Sweet and buttery. Dark fruits. Maybe Mulled wine or after dinner wine in there. There is a caramel scent in it too.

T - Taste follows scent with sweetness and dark fruits. Fig, plum, and possibly banana. Some booziness in the taste. No bitterness at all. There is a malty caramel or toffee that shows up as it warms up.

F - Good carbonation and cola consistency that smooths out as you drink

O - Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Very drinkable with no bitterness (a little booziness) and a lot of flavor. After trying Chimay Blue, White, and Red, I enjoyed this Red a lot. While the Blue seemed like a Winter beer, and the White was a good beer for light hops, the Red seems great for regular drinking and I will definitely add it to my annual rotation."
Rouge (Red),4.47,"L: beautiful hazy amber with a foam that lasts for the entire glass.

S: yeast forward, not too strong, but pleasant.

T: tastes of toast and toffee with fruity aftertaste, well balanced with yeast and hops.

F: wonderful mouth feel, pleasant foam and thickness.

O: truly excellent; a readily available leading example of the style."
Rouge (Red),4.77,"11.2oz bottle

Dark copper color, boozy smell, taste is tons of fruit esters and wheat and booze. Chewy and powdery and yeasty goodness"
Rouge (Red),5,This is my favorite Fall and Winter beer. I have loved it for 20 years. It has not always been available to me which makes it that much more special.
Rouge (Red),4.17,Bottle pour - opaque ruddy brown color with huge foamy beige head clinging to the glass for the duration.Nose is spicy and yeasty. Taste follows with some maltiness and a bit of stone fruit. Lingering spice on the finish. A fine dubbel.
Rouge (Red),4.39,"Chimay red was the last of the Chimay range I had the pleasure of trying, as it was difficult to find in my area of Ontario Canada.

Nose: Spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, apple, fig, mild alcohol heat and rich wheat and barley. Somewhat of a grape or red wine scent, currants perhaps.

In the Glass: Bold and beautiful rich frothy head.

Palate: Complex but simplistic, heavier on the malt side, with moments of a cidery overtones and some spice.

Finish: Warm and candied.
4/5 I would say this is my least favorite of the Chimay range , but nonetheless it is a fantastic ale."
Rouge (Red),4.58,I must have it again!
Rouge (Red),4.45,"Just very interesting, and a great evolution as it is warming up."
Rouge (Red),4.25,"Unknown vintage; drank 8/31/21 @ the Yarchives.

Murky dark orange rust appearance.

A slow pour yielded a big, fluffy white head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace.

Mulled cider, clove & banana notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Mulled cider, clove & banana flavors; solid classic dubbel vibes. I'd have another!"
Rouge (Red),4.3,"Bottled

Chimay Blue is a god-tier beer. Red is one that is not quite as acclaimed, but if it matches the quality of Blue I will be very impressed. Also, despite my love for Belgian beers, I have not had very many Dubbels, though I thoroughly enjoyed the one’s I’ve had. Let’s see if this legend lives up to the hype

Pours a murky mahogany color with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is beautiful balanced with the dark fruit and subtle spice complementing the chewy malt. I’m picking up on aromas of gold raisin, fig, dark toffee, allspice, brown bread, clove, and a hint of caramel

This focuses on the malt way more heavily in flavor, but works in its advantage. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting raisin, sticky toffee, brown bread, light black cherry, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of sweet black cherry, clove, doughy malt, light vanilla, molasses, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and luxuriously creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a wonderful sweetness

Such a wonderfully crafted beer, absolutely perfect for a warm summer night. I’d get it far more frequently if it wasn’t $8 a bottle"
Rouge (Red),4.55,"I like the red Chimay as it gives the taste of a Tripel with a lighter ABV of 7%. Complex beer with many of the fig/banana/ sweet candy flavours of others, without a lasting hangover. This bottle was a little light on the effervescent side, and the head was gone in a flash, with not much for carbonation through the ending dregs.
I am preparing myself for our annual holiday, Canada Day, when I will only drink the colours of the flag, Red and White.
Next up, Chimay White!"
Abner,4.34,"A really great double IPA! Had a pint at The Bench restaurant in Stowe VT. Pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. Mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and moderately bitter. An outstanding Double IPA!!"
Abner,4.61,Definitely a double. The alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. However the beer is truly a HF beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. Amazing beer but I prefer a lower alcohol beer.
Abner,4.69,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.

Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.

Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.

Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.

Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles."
Abner,4.48,"Draft at Armsby Abbey

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this

Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind

It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more"
Abner,4.5,"Had on tap. Pours a mostly clear light orange. Nice white head leaves a solid lace curtain. Smell and taste are fruity, with a little pine. Just an extremely well-crafted IIPA. Excellent."
Abner,3.55,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, from his massive NBS BIF # 15 hit. 16oz can (dated 8/18/20) poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.

A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence.

Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.

The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.

Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.

Overall, even though almost certainly faded, this still a really nice beer. Would like to try it fresh some time. Worth grabbing if you see it."
Abner,4.26,"can into glass
Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.
Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish."
Abner,4.51,"Appearance - The beer was bright yellow in color with a bubbly white head that left generous lacing.

Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness.

Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity.

Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better."
Abner,4.71,"Can fresh from brewery.
Similar to heady topper but better."
Abner,4.81,The best of the Hill Farmstead IPAs in My opinion. Smooth and bitter and the same time and a very delicate balance. Nose of citrus and color is like fruit juice.
Abner,4.71,wow!
Abner,4.63,"Canned 5/11/21
Consumed 6/2/21

It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like. I’m so happy to try this guy and will drink my remaining cans before they’re officially old!"
Abner,4.78,"I couldn’t be more lucky than to have fantastic neighbors willing to share a can of Hill F Abner. This was my first and right off the bat its smooth. Dare
I say there’s a creamy vanilla hint? The aroma is the classic fruity NE ipa. Is this really a dipa? Could not tell."
Leaner,4.42,"Had on tap. Bright yet somewhat pale yellow opaque body with a white head and trace amounts of lacing. Smell has big peach with effervescent bright oak, wild yeast, flowers and pollen aromas. Taste leads with peach juice and funk, playfully sour bright oak, flowers, wild yeast, a whisper of biscuit and apricot support. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, lightly tart and wild, bright. Nothing earth shattering, but a great wild peach saison"
Leaner,4.48,"Look - yellow with a slight hugh and nice white head
Smell - nice peach and tartness
Taste - peach tartness
Feel - medium light body with a nice carb
Overall - just delicious!"
Leaner,4.84,"3 June 2021 - Beer #239 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade

Appearance: 4 - looks a bit pale, but the head stuck around beautifully. I was expecting a deeper orange.

Nose: 5 - holy peaches! I don't detect much of anything else. Doesn't even smell sour.

Taste: 5 - oo, this is more complex than I expected. Tons of peach, but otherwise very dry. You really get the barrel a lot. See kids, this is the difference between a slushy kettle sour and a proper barrel aged sour.

Mouth: 4 - just a drop flat. Thick for a sour, but I could use a few more bubbles.

Overall: 5 - an outstanding saison. World class.

Cheers!"
Hopsecutioner,3.56,"12 oz can into a tumbler.
Sudsy foam. No lace. Smells nice and fruity and hoppy. Taste is just average IPA, at best. Feels a little weak.
Overall, chicken wing wash, after work refresher, just something in the glass, I guess.,"
Hopsecutioner,3.88,"Didn't realize the ABV was so low, but a pretty good IPA."
Hopsecutioner,3.7,Got this as a single from the local beer store. Poured it into a clear glass beer mug. Color was a slightly dark gold and the smell was similar to that of a SN Torpedo. Taste was decent and I'd drink it again.
Hopsecutioner,3.75,Mediocre IPA seen everywhere.
Hopsecutioner,4.29,"En World of the Seas (Flymaker's bar), en La Spezia. Tras excursión a Florencia. De Barril. Espuma eterna, sensación en boca suave y perfil de lúpulo resinoso amargo pero amable. Adictiva, anima a trago más largo de lo recomendable"
Hopsecutioner,4.25,"From a can; Santa Rosa Beach, FL."
Hopsecutioner,4.07,Hints of various fruit. Very bitter but good nonetheless
Hopsecutioner,3.69,"Not sure how to describe but initial taste was ""off"". Was better after that initial taste but missed the mark."
Hopsecutioner,3.67,It pours a unique copper with good lacing the smell is kind of misleading with strong notes of grapefruit the taste is mostly pine with not much bitterness not a favorite but overall not bad for something different every once in a while
Hopsecutioner,4,"Whatever that ails ya, ya know? Whatever that ails ya. And like a lolly pop after the doctor checked you for rabies, Hopsecutioner does Raul well and good. I may not dream of it, but in this waking life I will gladly take it.

Honestly is key, my children."
Hopsecutioner,3.74,On tap ATL airport. Mostly clear deep orange/gold with short white head leaving scattered lacing in the 20 oz plastic cup. Nose is citrus and sweet malt. Taste follows with more malt and earthy hop notes. Not much bitterness. Doesn't do the name justice.
Hopsecutioner,3.52,"Appearance: Pours a light to medium, clear, golden color with a moderate white head. SRM of 7-8. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of earthy and dank orange, tangerine marmalade, with some earthy and biscuit malt notes underneath.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of spice citrus, orange, resinous tangerine with a pine soap finish. Mild bitterness, and leans sweet

Feel: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation. Finish is sweet and slightly flat (3.50)

Compared to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA 1/21/22: Pours a lighter color with a milder head. Stronger aromas. More orange, tangerine. Less caramel and spice. A smaller body.

Overall: This one has resinous flavors of orange, tangerine, with somewhat of a soapy/chewy finish. Maybe some hop burn. I think it could use more carbonation. (Final Rating: 3.52)"
Hopsecutioner,3.91,"Smooth upfront, but plenty of punch and a flavorful finish. Very drinkable. Enjoyed it."
Hopsecutioner,3.92,On tap at Terrapin in Athens. Pours a copper color with a slight head. Not the hops bomb I was expecting. Definitely a combination of grapefruit and pine with the pine winning. But not over the top.
Hopsecutioner,4.33,"Clear light copper, thick white head, great retention, chunky swaths of lace. Very pretty
Old school west coast aroma: grapefruit, pine, a bit of dank, and caramel
Taste follows aroma for the most part, there's a little bit of tropical fruit mixed in as well.
Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. A little bit sticky
Man, I miss these type of IPA"
Impermanence,5,"Rating tells everything! This is an absolutely awesome beer, for me Perfection!"
Impermanence,4.59,"mmm..... yummy lactose..... sigh..... why not throw some ExLax in ther with it? i hear it comes in chocolate flavor these days.... aside from that... goddammmm this shit is good! and it's, like, eight months old.... they put out such exceptioinal stuff.... let's see how the bowels handle it tonight though.... Bottle Logic lactose stouts TEAR MY ASS UP!"
Impermanence,4.31,"Excellent head production and good retention. Overall, an attractive beer.

Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.

Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.

Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.

An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it."
Impermanence,4.46,"Canned in a big old tallboy crafty can and brought back to me by my sister from a trip to Berwick upon Tweed

Impermanence,4,Picked-up two cans at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for about eight dollars each. My one hundred and forty second brew from these guys. Probably my least favorite stout from these guys.
Hop Wallop,4.5,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I have not reviewed this before, have probably had a case of this. Miss this beer."
Hop Wallop,3.96,"A smooth drinking IPA that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. The head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. The beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. The taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes, but with some tropical fruit notes too. This definitely packs a wallop at 7.5%, but does drinks more like a session. Could definitely have more than one, but I would not advise, as the alcohol could sneak up on you. Enjoy the drinkability and smoothness of this wonderfully crafted IPA!"
Hop Wallop,4.85,"I’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a Hop Devil. It is still one of my favorites. Great flavor, color, nose, and flavor. Victory excels again."
Hop Wallop,3.47,"Appearance:
Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.

Bouquet:
Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.

Feel:
A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.

Taste:
Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.

Overall:
Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for."
Hop Wallop,4.28,"Pours golden yellow with a 2 inch white head with good retention. Heavy lacing to end.

Strong aroma of pine, grapefruit, earthy, floral.

Taste is resiny, pine, slight spiciness, including pepper.

Medium bodied, light carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

This is a damn good IPA! One of the best."
Hop Wallop,3.83,"Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now.
Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy.
The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there.
The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry.
The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry
Overall, not for the faint of heart, this is what old school DIPA's seem to have started out as. This is one I would come back to preferably for me."
Hop Wallop,3.05,"Pretty awful. I love a bitter west coast IPA but this is like licking dirt. Theres no redeeming malty balance
Its pithy and downright awful imo."
Hop Wallop,3.7,"From a 12oz bottle dated enjoy by 5/6/20. Pours a golden translucent yellow with about two fingers of white fluffy head. Moderate retention, decent lacing. Smells of fresh cut grass. Not picking up much else. Taste is similar to the nose. Grassy and bitter. Mouthfeel is dry with a bitter aftertaste. This a palate wrecker. Overall, not picking up the fruitiness described on the label, but it's not awful. Pretty much a hop bomb. Price point is favorable as well, less than $11 for a 6er."
Hop Wallop,3.17,"It pours clean, retains a slight head with fine lacing, looks decent, gold with very few particles, it smells nice and naturey but I couldn't taste anything! Nothing except a very slight sour pinch from tropic fruits and tiny bit of bitter. Interesting... For a beer that has ""Hop"" in the name I figured it'd be like most IPA's but this one is extremely unusual. I guess it's ok, goes down easy and has high ABV. Hell, I'd try it again just to see if it really doesn't have any taste."
Hop Wallop,3.67,"big fan of the brewery but this one is not fully working for me. i haven't had this one in a few years and i think they made some changes that i don't find
L: looks fine
S; some citrus and grass
T: this is where it goes awry for me. strong lemony taste that is just distracting. all i get beyond it is the bitterness. just not a pleasant combination.
F: smooth with medium carbonation
O: sorry - i wanted to like it much more but i'm not feeling it."
Hop Wallop,4.06,"12oz bottle enjoy by 06 May 2020 poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 7.5% ABV. The beer pours bright light amber with abundant off white head. The head slowly settles to thick cap leaving the glass covered in lacing. The aroma dank and earthy predominantly with notes of citrus and pine underneath. The taste is more of the same with citrus and pine given the heavy hitting Simcoe punch over a pleasant light malt body. Heavily bitter throughout (no surprise). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good, but not in my taste preference. I'm not a big Simcoe fan and it dominates this beer IMO. Still very well made and a nice reminder of this beer blowing my mind years ago."
Hop Wallop,3.93,"Pours a semi translucent light honey color with a foamy white head , which dissipates quickly. Smell is reminiscent of citrus,mild toffee, (never used that description for an IPA), hay and earth. Taste is some fruitiness and some dank earth flavor.Mildly astringent. Surprised at the large malt bill, hops get washed away too quickly by a malt rush. (Uneven?) Feels well carbonated, medium body,finishes juicy. Overall if it did not have such an edge the malt bill could be reduced in my opinion. Seems the added malt was necessary because of the beer's astringency. Definitely get walloped by the hops. Good beer"
Hop Wallop,4.39,"12 oz bottle fresh
Poured about 20oz in a nice tall ale glass
Beautiful classic appearance of clear and golden ale with a big foamy white head that sticks around.
The aroma is not overpowering, but very pleasant of citrus and tropical fruit and some biscuit
the flavor starts with the biscuit malt and is quickly surpassed by bitter grapefruit from the hops. There is some caramel from the malt and some sweet mango at the end.
This is a superb IPA and the price point is fantastic at $10/six."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.64,"Born 25 July, 2017. 12.9% ABV.
Top popped (53 degrees) with a whimpering sigh, got a nice coffee aroma right away. Almost zero head at all made for a full pour into my 12oz Avery Brewing snifter.
Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space.
The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat.
Mouthfeel is decadant! Little bit of carbonation lightened the usual BCBS heaviness.
Not overly syrupy too! Yay!
Overall - a remarkably smooth and excellent treat that stood up to 5 years of temperature controlled storage.
Damn fine Stout!"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,5,"12 oz bottle, born on 11/7/2014, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:

F - thick mouthfeel and no carbonation at all
O - outstanding beer, even at almost 8 years old!"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.09,"2014 Vintage

Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.

Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.

Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.

Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.

Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.6,"Goose Island – Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout (BCBCS – 2014)

12.6% ABV

The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter.

First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5

Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25

Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25

Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70

Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75

Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65

BA Review Score: 4.56"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.53,"Bottled 7/25/17, cracking this open just over 4 years later

Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out

Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs

This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry

The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat

This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.65,My favorite coffee beer
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.66,"2017 Vintage

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown

A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.

T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable.

M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.

O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.56,"2014 vintage poured into a pint glass.

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle.

Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.

Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.

Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.

Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base."
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.21,"2013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee

335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.

Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.

Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.

Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.

Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged."

T: resiny oaky combo of really good coffee and chocolate/vanilla. Tobacco, earth, cinnamon. Smooth af. Not boozy.

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.63,"Ok this beer is over Ten Years old and is the Black Cat Expresso version. Was bottled on 03/26/10 - 2208 and It has been cellared in a wine fridge for the whole time at 14 degrees Celcius.

A - well its damn dark Black oily colour with a dark beige head that dies quickly.
S - Very large aromas of old potted coffee and smoley dark vanilla.
T - Wow. Massive. So up fron some milky latte flavours that pretty soon get drowned out by massive expresso dark coffee. The finish is smokey rolled tobacco before a nice sweet finish ensues that is made up of vanilla and caramel. Its massive !
M - Deep deep body with light to medium carbonation
O - Huge beer that is very bold is every sense. It has aged so very well, the only dissapointment is that it didnt smoothen out more as it packs such a punch. This beer is by no means past its best and will go into my Hall of Fame"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,4.91,"Bottled 11/7/14
Consumed 5/1/20

Purchased from Goose recently, so I assume it was stored properly. It has none of the vegetable taste I have had in some older coffee BCS. This bottle is perfect. A wonderful balance of coffee bitterness and the sweet BCS barrel notes. I love the smell. There’s a lot of coffee here. Drinking it I get a lot of coffee too. I haven’t had a newer bottle in some time, and I know this beer has lost some of its mystique, but in 2014 it was still perfect."
Old Chub,4.01,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 12-7-2021

On the pour a nice, tan, 3 finger head forms filling my pint glass, it then recedes over a couple minutes to a thin foam cap and ring around the glass. The color is a very dark reddish brown that becomes a dark brown red in the light. Lazy carbonation finds its way to the surface.

Smell is quite roasty but with strong notes of dried date from the mingling of yeast and malts. Some vague hopping possibly detected? Definitely a complex malt forward traditional scotch ale smell. Quite sweet.

Taste follows the smell but brings more roast amd leaves a little bit of the dark fruitiness. It is still present but it shows up more with the slight wave of bitterness after the sweet caramel malt notes pass. The bitterness does build a bit as you drink, as well as sweet yeast character. Quite a complex beer, quite low ibu I'm assuming however.

Feel is quite velvety, and not too heavy especially for the abv. It does stay on the palate a bit and Definitely isn't watery but it is very easy to drink.

Overall a traditional scotch ale from an American brewery. And a very interesting yeast and malt character at that. Some hops present in the form of a vague bitterness, but quite earthy and sweet. This is good."
Old Chub,4.08,"This is a 12oz. can poured into my Oskar Blues pint glass. The brew is a dark brown, to dark to observe the carbonation. The head is almost a finger of thick tan foam that quickly recedes to a thin cap.
The aroma is sweet malts, toffee..
The flavor starts sweet, some cocoa, a touch of coffee, then there is a crisp dryness with a little alcohol bite at the finish .
The palate feels a smoothness up front, a slight dryness, and a little heat from the 8% ABV.
This tastes very good and I keep going back for more, but I suggest you sip this one and enjoy. I think this one could sneak up on a guy!"
Old Chub,4.18,"Brownish red color with a half inch of light tan head. The nose is chocolate, toasted whole wheat bread, rye, wet grain, and a touch of coffee. The taste is almond toffee, brown bread, molasses, hazelnuts with the skin on, roasted corn, and a delicious maltiness. Very nicely balanced beer that goes from mildly sweet to barely dry to a light lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess that borders on chewy. The key here is the malty grainy toffee taste. This is a very good drinkable beer."
Old Chub,4.43,"Very good beer, complex and chewy, woodsy flavors of maple syrup, raisin, butterscotch, cocoa, toasted bread, caramel, vanilla, licorice. The expected sweetness for the style is nicely balanced by a touch of bitterness and even a hint of minty pine as the flavors linger. Excellent smooth rich feel, thick but not sticky, with a great jolt of lively fizz. My personal favorite of the Scotch ales. A malt monster, not for hopheads. An excellent beer as close to flawless as I've had."
Old Chub,4.85,The best!!!
Old Chub,4.04,"Deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, nut, cocoa, and dark fruits. Taste is sweet of cola and dark cherries, nutty roasted malts and a definite smoked flavor. Some marshmallow as well. Nice medium chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol is held in check by the full malt flavors and overall this is a nice ale."
Old Chub,4.04,"12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Canned 3/26/21.

L---Opaque dark ruby brown color. Fluffy tan head settled to a ring and left very nice lacing.

S---Sweet malty goodness. Caramel, dark fruits, bread.

T---Follows the nose closely.

F---it's a wee heavy.

O---A really nice one. I'd get this again."
Old Chub,4.2,"355 mL can from the LCBO; dated Aug 14 2020 and served barely chilled. This is the last of a 4-pack that I bought in late 2020.

Pours a muddied brownish-amber colour, with a deliberately rough pour producing half an inch of foamy beige head. It leaves behind a thin collar, but little else worth mentioning - though a good swirl does leave some spotty lacing and legs behind. Mostly just sweet on the nose - lots of caramel and toffee, with notes of cherry red licorice candy, dates and figs; these obscure subtler suggestions of toasted bread, molasses, plum and alcohol.

A fine beer, indeed - complex and flavourful, though the scales are certainly tipped toward the 'malt' side of the equation, with an almost fruit cake-like flavour at the forefront. There's caramel, toffee, toasted bread and molasses, as well as cherry, prune, date and fig; hints of cocoa and smoked malt at the finish, leading in to a slightly warming aftertaste with lingering hints of toffee, earthiness and dark fruits, as well as a touch of booziness. Medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that weakly brush against the surface of the tongue; feels smooth and a little slick on the palate. If you've got more than one can, you might want to pace yourself - it's easy to pour down the hatch, but as Samuel Jackson once said, it'll get'cha drunk.

Final Grade: 4.2, an awesome A-. Old Chub has been on my wants list for a couple years, and I'm thrilled to strike it off. I don't know if this is the best scotch ale I've ever had - it's tasty for sure, with a varied array of flavours, and the 8% is exceedingly well-integrated. That being said, the smoked malt aspects are fairly subtle, and overall it's a little sweet for my tastes - minor flaws for this style, of course, if they can even be considered flaws in the first place. If you see this beer and are in any way curious, do not hesitate to purchase it - I'll be doing so again at the first opportunity."
Old Chub,4.29,"Pours deep mahogany with amber glints and a small toffee colored head. Huge raisin, caramel, stewed fruit notes in the nose. The taste is intensely malty with roasty notes mixed with berry and fruity notes. Leafy, woody hops in the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Cherry, chocolate and roasted barley notes in the finish.

A nice Wee Heavy. Very malty and complex. A must try if you like malty beers."
Old Chub,4.48,"L: Pours a very deep brown, mahogany if you will. Accompanied by a somewhat thin tan head.
S: Smells rich of toasted malts, sweet, little bit of caramel, dark fruits, toffee, kind of bready.
T: Very much follows the nose, chocolate & vanilla are present in the taste as well.
F: I would say full-bodied, low carbonation, warming feeling from the alcohol, but not too much, smooth...
O: Really impressed by this one, definitely will buy again."
Old Chub,4.04,"look: two finger off white head which quickly dissipates to a thin layer of bubbles, beer is a clear mahogany colour with good levels of carbonation in the beer.

smell: quite a nice aroma, smokey, peaty, scotch, black bread, toffee, dark fruits, cherry, prune, raisin, fig, molasses, treacle, smells boozy enough, nice sweetness to it.

taste: a tasty malty ale, brown and black bread, toast, smokey, ash, a touch oaky, some whiskey, scotch whiskey, peaty, caramel and toffee, sweet dark fruits, fig and raisin, sweet fruits and smokey malts linger on the finish, as well as some bitterness, quite nice.

feel: medium bodied, light to medium carbonation, would be nice if it was a bit fuller bodied, some alcohol warming, quite drinkable for its strength

overall: a most pleasant ale from oskar blue’s, very easy drinking at eight percent, and quite tasty."
Old Chub,4.21,"Clear mahogany appearance with a large beige head and very good lacing. Malty aroma dotted with caramel, walnut shells and toffee. Earthy, smoky, toasty, grainy flavor, a touch of licorice, more caramel sweetness. Finally, at the very back of the palate, a modest amount of floral hops. Medium-to-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel. Alcohol is warming but not intrusive. Overall, just really nice and pleasant."
Old Chub,3.78,"On tap at Das Beer Garden. Deep brown. Smells of toffee and caramel. Light butterscotch notes. Tastes of toasty malts, hop bitterness, then toffee and faint hints of butterscotch. Medium heavy. Hoppy enough to barely taste like a wee heavy. Mostly tastes like a big, sweet brown ale, but hints of the scotch ale come back in the back end."
Old Chub,4.15,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber with a tiny head that dissolved pretty quickly, however, there was some nice lacing left behind.

Smells mainly of caramel malts, toffee, coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit.

This brew evolved as it warmed, initially when it was cold I was only able to pick up the caramel and the coffee up front with a hint of the dark fruit, but the latter flavors and aroma came alive once it warms up. When it warms it approaches cloying, however I am completely fine with that because sweet beers are my thing. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty tasty brew, cheers! Only thing that's somewhat disappointing is that I'm not picking up much of the smokiness. I paired this with lamb chops."
Old Chub,4.19,"Pours a dark amber color with a light tan head.

Tastes of smoky malts and toffee sweetness with a bit of breadiness mixed in. Has a mild bitter finish that does not build and a pleasant aftertaste."
Congress Street IPA,4.34,Poured from 16oz can. Pours hazy yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of hops leaped out of the can and continues in the glass. Taste is hoppy and a bit of citrus. Feel is clean with a bit of hop oil feel. Overall it's a tasty IPA.
Congress Street IPA,4.42,"07/06/22. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.

A: Murky Arnold Palmer hue with 1-finger foamy white head with below average retention and spotty lacing.

S: Blasts of lemon, lime, guava, mango, peach, grapefruit, and orange with an herbal, honeysuckle note and a bit of malt sweetness. Esters are moderate and candy-fruity in nature.

T: Unapologetic flavor assault with lemon, lime, guava, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, and definite notes of honeysuckle and marijuana in the late palate and aftertaste. Esters are a little lower in intensity in the flavor but add the same candied fruit notes as the aroma. Bitterness is low-medium and alcohol is well-hidden. Delicious hazy IPA.

M: Medium-bodied with more dry finish than most NEIPAs.

O: A high-aroma, high-flavor NEIPA that is a superb example of the style and amazingly made it to my local store within a reasonable time! Thanks Wine Warehouse for spreading the delicious high-demand beer around."
Congress Street IPA,3.87,"On tap at Dominion Wine & Beer. Juicy , no hop stringency like some other Trillium beers. Cloudy faded orange. Low head. Dry, citrusy finish. Low aroma."
Congress Street IPA,4.06,"Looks like watered down orange juice with opaque body and a medium collar of white bubbles. Nose is vaguely citrusy before a swirl. After, I get a punch of OJ when I first did this. Later attempts paired that scent with some floral tropical notes and an earthy bitterness.

First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base. Hints of grapefruit and orange rind act as lead-ins to pine in the form of both wood and dark green needles.

The evolution of this beer isn’t much, it’s pretty straightforward earthy and bitter to my palate."
Congress Street IPA,4.5,"On tap, a wonderful hazy IPA that hits all the right notes of Galaxy: tropical fruit, citrus and earthy herbs. Great stuff."
Congress Street IPA,4.45,"Appearance - The beer was hazy yellow in color with a fluffy white one inch head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was initially fruity, but the bitterness came forward later.

Taste - The taste was initially pretty mild with notes of papaya and mango. The profile shifted to bitter lemon rind and pine notes. A light bready backbone was present. In many ways, it was like drinking liquid lemon rind. The bitterness of the lemon lingered. This tasted like a take-no-prisoners west coast IPA.

Mouthfeel - The body was huge, cloudy like a NEIPA. Carbonation was somewhat smothered by the body.

Overall - I was a bit surprised by the bitterness, but I liked it."
Congress Street IPA,4.9,"#127, good stuff!"

It has grapefruit aroma and not particularly strong. Taste is all hops. Mostly grapefruit and pine. Definitely of the West Coast variety. I imagine it much crisper if it were fresh.

Double Jack,3.49,"12oz can

Incredible value here if you can find it on sale. I paid less than a dollar-a-can, and for an impressive ~10% IPA that's no common feat. It drinks pretty good, just like budweiser, milluh, and what somma these otha' beers we got? But for real, it's smooth, overly hopped, pine and bitter and no taste of alcohol (just the burn in your gut) - or balance. Nothing outstanding here, just exceptionally well-done, solid, etc, insert your adjective here. Clear look, head that sticks around, doesn't smell like much besides hop pellets... Just buy this beer, it's worth it

Dangerously drinkable, indeed"
Double Jack,4.41,Excellent Double IPA!
Double Jack,4.44,"There was a time the quality of a brew with the Firestone Walker label went unchallenged. Recently, there have been rumors heard that may no longer be true. This investigation begins by pouring two 12 oz. cans into a clear glass liter mug. A pretty pour it is. The color is a bright and nearly translucent copper. Well carbonated, a small enduring head is joined by good glass lacing and noticed. Not pungent, there is a soft aroma of malt and hops around the glass. Wonderfully drinkable, this does everything a great DIPA should. It's malt forward is velvety, slightly sweet, perfectly carbonated and earthy the way only barley can deliver. At the finish, the hops rule the taste. Nicely complex, they are a little fruity and mostly piney at the finish. There is a taste contribution from the alcohol that isn't distracting and belongs within a good American Double IPA. So much for rumors."
Double Jack,4.21,"Appearance: Clear and golden-hued, slim, off-white head, long-lasting.

Aroma: Dank and pungent. Wide open and fuming with fruity and floral aromatics, crackling with hop bitterness. Citric fruits aplenty, with tropical, as well. Stone fruit, too. Orange and lemon meet mango and apricot. Lovely stuff.

Let's drink! That cornucopia of the aroma is plump on the palate, with hop bitterness hanging in close on the side. Just about perfect. Several ounces in, and the booze rises up. It sits happily in the mouth, and causes no fuss, just the general happy feelings we associate it with. Ah, yes. And, yum, yum.

Beautiful fruit, beautiful booze, beautiful bitterness. Mmm, yes. Soft mouthfeel, brilliant hoppy texture, long finish. How many ways do I love this wonderful beer? How many ways are there?"

Double Jack,4.35,"Look: Crystal clear burnt orange with a pure white head that billows up and settles quickly to a fine film, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Crushed pine needles, grapefruit rind, orange, sweetened strawberries, a little Cannabis, lemon, and malty notes that while present, hide quite well
Taste: Pine, citrus, berries, and dank come out swinging and all over top of a much more present sweet malt base, though make no mistake, hops are the standout frontrunner here. Near the finish, pine and citrus are again in the spotlight and closes with a great hop bite along with some sweetness
Mouthfeel: Big, full – almost viscous, a little slick, some alcohol heat, medium-high carbonation, and medium dryness on the finish
Overall: This is big, bold, and awesome stuff. A total throwback WCDIPA that is huge on pine and citrus along with being a full-feeling beer, has great dryness, and some booze heat that leaves no doubt it’s big. Fun to try this again after so many years of it being retired and nice to see [taste] it’s still a winner"
Double Jack,4.33,"Slightly hazy, small but tight head. Great aromas of floral and fruit. First sip is smooth but assertive hops come right over the top. For a DIPA, this one has superb balance. The stiff ABV is well masked and lies in wait for the unwary; it's very drinkable. Taste is tropical / stone fruit...dates, figs and peaches overlying a solid malt base. F-W has done it again."
Double Jack,4.25,"12oz can. Can bottom stamped with '08/28/20'.
Clear, gold colored body. One finger of fluffy white head upon pouring, settles away to a thin cover. Leaves a few scattered spots of lacing.
Aroma of grapefruit and other citrus.
Taste is apricot and peach, and later is resin and pine. Good malt underpinning.
Medium mouth feel, with some stickiness. Very good carbonation.
Provides a little alcohol burn, but the flavors tend to be sweet. One of the old guard, and easy to drink."
Double Jack,4.27,"12oz canned 8/29/20, opened 10/15/20.
1 finger off-white head, decent retention in a steady fall to a cap.
Deep golden color DIPA with very good clarity.
Orange blossom, citrus, berry, floral, hop spice, pine, perceived light caramel.
Big aroma...explosive...maybe, almost.
Lots of the above aromas carrying through...so tasty in it's (mostly) traditional flavors.
Add some stone fruit flavor to the mix that wasn't present in the aroma...maybe even melon.
Medium body, bright entry and mouthfeel. Some heat in the long finish.
Drinkability is high and the strength is deceiving.
Outstanding."
Double Jack,4.34,"L: This Beer poured an amber, copper color with a nice frothy egg-shell colored head. Bubbles floated quickly to the top consistently throughout my entire time drinking the 12 oz can.

S: The smells flowing from this beer were very green and pine-y. I detected hints of citrus such as orange in the scent, with a very slight tinge of booze. The smell was extremely appetizing and made me excited to sip it.

T: As far as double IPA’s go, this tasted great. There was a nice initial tinge of orange with a delicious malty and biscuity flavor flowing over the tongue afterwards. It finishes with a long bitterness that plays on the tongue afterwards for several minutes. Personally, I couldn’t taste much of the alcohol if at all.

F: Mouth feel was great. Very full and hardy with decent carbonation that wasn’t so extreme that it harmed the experience. It definitely felt fun and full in the mouth, but not so heavy that it might have creeped into a creamy territory.

O: Overall a delicious double IPA that I would definitely consider buying a pack of. With 9.5 abv it definitely packs a punch, but the flavors are there to back it up. Great showing by Firestone Walker."
La Chouffe (Blonde),3.99,"330 ml bottle
Served in a tulip glass

This beer pours a hazy golden color. It is topped with a couple inches of creamy, off-white head that leaves nice lacing.

Spiced pear aroma. Nice spiciness from the yeast

The taste follows the smell. Spiced pear, Great Belgian yeast flavors

Thin bodied with an effervescent mouthfeel

Classic Belgian Blonde. I can't believe I have not had this before."
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.02,Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip like glass; best by date July 2023. Pours golden yellow with plenty of fizzy bubbles and decent white foamy head; good looking beer. Tastes of banana and slight crackery taste. Good.

La Chouffe (Blonde),4.21,"Poured from a 330mL bottle, best by April 2023 into my belgian mini chalice

On the pour a 2 finger white head of fine and medium bubbles forms on top of a very hazy golden body with quite lively carbonation.

The aroma is very big and a bit musty right off the bat. This beer is all yeast and almost a bit barnyard like. Behind the immediate funk, there are banana esters that mingles with the coriander and light hops quite nicely to make a spicy orange like sweet aroma.

The flavor loses a lot of the barnyard that's on the nose but the esters are still present and quite nice as they lead into the once again spicy coriander and phenol character. That is followed by a nice light blonde malty crackery note that mixed with a solid but subtle bitterness.

Feel is not as big as the ABV would imply, as it is honestly a refreshing beer. The carbonation bite is quite intense and the head makes for a nice creaminess every sip. It has a very long finish and the malts coat your mouth on the final evolution.

Overall this is a very interesting belgian, however I don't have a lot of experience with these big blegian light beers. Very similar to a tripel but with some barnyard notes and extra hopping. Quite a strong beer."
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.27,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium orange color with a massive head. SRM of 9. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus and wheat predominate. Belgian spices including coriander and floral notes. European bread malts present through the end.

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange, coriander, Belgian spices. Some floral notes, but a nice dose of coriander in the middle that dissolves into a strong yeasty and bready mouthfeel. Plenty of Belgian and German spices. More German bread and oranges on the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Massive carbonation, yeast, and a billowing mouthfeel. Finish is bready sweet, but so much yeast to balance it out.

Overall: A very authentic and classic Belgian Pale Ale for a reason. Fantastic orange, bread, coriander, flower and Belgian spices. This is only upfront. Then comes a large yeast mouthfeel to completely dry the palate for the rich and smooth bread malt that follows. Rounds out into an absolute banger of a Belgian Ale. I can see why this is the #2 Belgian Pale Ale. It wonderfully bready and Belgian-spiced. (Rating: 4.27)"
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.32,"Tasty but not the best… could be the bottling but it had a slight metallic taste to start out with… slightly sweet and smooth, not bitter, pretty dang good"
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.49,"11.2 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best before May 2023, so plenty fresh.

L---Clear, rich golden color. Giant head faded down slowly and left spectacular lacing.

S---Coriander, clove, bready malts. Very nice.

T---Coriander up front. Wheat, clove & banana. Complex & full of flavor.

F---Medium leaning full bodied. Ample carbonation. Almost a creamy feel.

O---An excellent beer in a favorite style of mine."
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.25,"Crowler filled 4/23/22; drank 4/24/22 @ the Yarchives.

Cloudy orange/yellow appearance.

A rough pour yielded almost no off-white head; almost no lace.

Apple, clove & faint white raisin notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Clove, soft apple & some wheat flavors.

A nice, pleasant ale. I'd have another!"

La Chouffe (Blonde),4.5,"11.2oz bier

Look is like it could be in a movie. Smell is coriander and clove and a very sweet not-quite-banana. Nice and crisp at first, sweet and soft at the end. Tons of coriander and fruity/floral sweetness, lemon hops sitting in warm grain... husky wheat, bubblegum almost

Very good, much better than Duvel - bonus points for availability around me, every Total Wine has it"
La Chouffe (Blonde),4.17,"Nice, golden hue with a white head. Smells yeasty and spicy. Tastes of hops, fruits, and, spice. Well carbonated but mouthfeel is soft. I really liked the hops in this one."
IPA,4.29,"This is a 12oz. can with an aggressive pour into the 20oz. weizen glass. For starters I have a three fingers of thick foam that is not quite pure white. The ale has an orange tint, the brew is clear with a steady stream of carbonation. The head has settled to one finger, with thick lacing left behind.
The aroma is the IPA pine and sweet citrus., not overly strong but the scent is noticeable from a distance.
The flavor is sweet grapefruit, then a bit dry, with some light hop bitterness. This is a great blend, not too sweet and not too tart.
The feel is somewhat light, this ale is very refreshing and a great nightcap after cutting several trees up on this late August evening. I know I will revisit this IPA! I think if I was an IPA guy, this would be the one!!!"
IPA,3.75,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass at Shrimp Shack in beautiful Fort Myers, FL.
Another of what I like to call ‘complimentary’ beers.
It ‘goes with’ … dot dot dot.
Taken on its own, it’s probably ‘just a common IPA’. But put it next to, say, a shrimp po’ boy, and it takes on a life of its own and makes the entire experience palpable.
And that makes this an OK sud.
Knowmasayin?"
IPA,3.65,"Look...a clear copper with a thin off white head.
Smell...A hop floral spice dank. hints of caramel malt.
Taste...A sweet resinous grapefruit with pine, a bitter resin caramel with a segway of fruit to a
dry finish.
Feel...An ample mouth full that makes this beer taste bigger than it is. slick and lip smacker
Overall...A beer I have yet to try in so many years and all of the other beers I have had from Lagunitas. A good and solid beer I would have again and hope it to be fresher than 2 months old. I feel this beer woudl be a little better fresh just like most IPAs. Anyways very solid"
IPA,3.6,"What a crappy, floral, disgusting IPA. Somehow people not only drink this, it is immensely poplar. Usually I think the customer is always right, but in this case I question my subjective experience and wonder if others are tasting what I am tasting."
IPA,4.31,The sweetness on the palate makes this IPA a real winner for me. Still hoppy as hell but the palate would win over most IPA-ters.
IPA,4,Pours a clear amber. Thin foam. Big hop aroma. Juicy hop body. Good sweetness without distracting from the hops. Medium bitter finish. Really solid IPA.
IPA,4.25,Poured into a 16 oz pint glass at Red Robin (yummm) in Saratoga Springs. Pours tan yellow - opaquish - with two fingers of head. Nice balance of malt back with hop forward front. Very refreshing and solid beer.
IPA,3.81,"Notes of grapefruit. Deep gold color. Very hoppy flavor. Overall a good IPA for less than $2/bottle, and it's available at most gas stations. Hard to be upset with this beer."
IPA,5,"Pours a nice golden color with a 1” white head. Lacing is very nice. Drinking my 2nd one of these for the night…the 2nd is even better than the first. I’m a huge fan of Lagunitas and love several of their IPA offerings but never had tried their original IPA; I figured it was time to. The head and smell of this brew is so delightfully refreshing and tantalizing. This is definitely the most balanced IPA I’ve ever drank. It’s not hop loaded nor malt loaded…it’s just a very balanced, mild IPA, with an overall nectarine/peach flavor to it. Definitely a wonderful session IPA that I will drink again."
IPA,3.78,"Pours a clear, coppery-yellow colour. A one finger head bubbles down into a spotty yet creamy cap.

Incredibly unique aroma that I have not encountered in the 73 beers I’ve reviewed so far. Earthy, grassy, floral and a bit savoury. I’m thinking this is due to the crazy amount of hop and malt mix in here. Hoping there is a nice mix in the palate rather than a haphazard one. Biscuity malts and straw, pine needles and dried fruit leaves.

Pleasant malt biscuitiness on the front of the tongue and a light pleasant bitterness on the back end that is mildly piney and just a bit citrusy. Grapefruit mostly. Pleasant mix of both and the malt and bready flavours shine out quite well.

Lightly bitter body that is pleasant with a bready aftertaste, this leans towards a lighter body with medium carbonation that is pretty classic.

43 hops and 60+ malts, wow. I’d say this leans to a more homogenized taste but it’s still nice and subtle and varied. Definitely not homicidally hopped, maybe at one point when it first came out. But it’s great to have it to remember what benchmark, typical IPAs tasted like, both years ago and historically. They were nowhere near as hopped as they are now, and this provides a great benchmark for what IPAs, and even APAs in reference to IPAs should/used to taste like.

It’s great and classic, very enjoyable. Our taste buds might be scorched by modern beers these days, sort of like how hardcore smokers with tarred up palates would drink the most peated, explosively fiery scotches and claim they barely taste it! It’s still very classic and enjoyable, much more than the average beer."
IPA,3.56,"Pours a semi-clear amber color with off white head and good lacing. Smells of biscuit, malt, dried fruit, very fresh with no skunkiness. Tastes of malt, biscuit, hops, and dried apricots with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel to me is very luxurious, with some carbonation and hops that lightly covers the tongue. This is a really good beer!"
IPA,4,"This is the IPA that turned me onto IPAs. Before Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada Pale was my ""IPA."" I liked Lagunitas so much, that's pretty much all I drank and scarcely ever touched Sierra ever again... I tried everything from Lagunitas, Little Sumpin, Maximzizer, etc. and their seasonal selections. I drank it all until I literally couldn't anymore. I started to hate beer. I couldn't go back to Pale or Lager or anything. If it was beer, I literally couldn't drink anything but Lagunitas. So I switched to whiskey and it was perfect and I lost like 30 pounds from not drinking beer and I didn't look back for a long, long time, maybe 2 years. By the time I came back around to beer drinking, there was this whole new world of craft IPAs that were almost all better than Lagunitas. Lagunitas had become the ""IPA"" of Budweiser. I still enjoy it once and awhile and appreciate it--but much like I can hardly ever drink a Sam Adams ever again, I will be the same with Lagunitas now. It opened me up to a entirely new world of beers, but at the same time, I think the industrialization of it ruined it forever..."
IPA,4.38,"This signature lagunitas IPA defined IPA for me and I absolutely love it!

Look: Beautiful clear amber-golden appearance with a medium off white head and leaves some lacing.

Smell: Light malty-ness and bready-ness with the classic piney hop presence.

Taste: Classic flavors of pine, citrus, moderate hop presence with a medium mouthfeel and a crisp dry finish.

Overall a very pleasant beer with 6.2% ABV and 51.5 IBU"
IPA,3.77,"No discernible dating. Might be old, might not be. *shrug* - It's what's out there. (& why I haven't had this til now)

Short version : basic old-school WCIPA, well-done. Nothing special, ""just"" good.

The usual orangey-amber, with one finger or so of off-white head. Smells & tastes of pine and bitter citrus, with moderate, moderately-sharp carbonation bite , and medium feel."
IPA,4.34,It’s a stellar ipa. Taste and feel are there. Look is good enough. Smell is meh but who cares. As far as hip heavy IPAs go this is a home run. I came in a skeptic left a believer. Good stuff at Lagunitas. I wouldn’t call it homicidally hoppy bc I didn’t puke from the overly bitter taste covering up a poor product. Instead this quality brew made me laugh. Drink this and laugh.
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.9,"Another classic. Actually quite enjoyable. I went to college in Boulder and don’t fully understand why this became so popular everywhere, but it it helped usher in the craft revolution and is a whole lot better than bud light."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.33,Malty with nice mellow hoppy bitterness.
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.51,"it tastes ok, but there is this odd after taste, that goes with the smell like the pine from an ipa"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,4.13,poured from a 12oz bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a light amber with a finger of off-white foam head. toasted malts on the nose with the taste following. it’s got decent mouthfeel. a little bland but it’s readily available and it’s no terrible.
Fat Tire Amber Ale,4,"obviously a successful beer, and very crushable. balanced and functional. not exciting, but very solid choice in a pinch"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.75,"Draft. Good drinkable amber ale, not bitter, would drink it again."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.87,"Nice amber color, fairly clear and pulls a alright head, not amazing but its something. Smells alright, nice hit of toasted malt, caramel and floral/citrusy hops. A tad bit of the yeast comes through on the nose. Taste is pretty good. Its very crisp and refreshing. The toasty malt hits you first, then you the hops, but not alot of bitterness. The finish is good, crisp and you dont get any alcohol. Overall great mainstream beer."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,2.25,"A very light tasting beer that isn’t bitter. Middle is average, not exceptional. I can’t help but feel a watered down taste at the end"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.53,"This review is mostly from memory from last night, couldn’t review it properly but not a big deal as this beer is pretty much just a straightforward, inoffensive amber.

No appreciable head on the pour but it is a gorgeous crystal clear, darker orange-amber colour. Genuinely amber. Very nice. Aromas of grassy but most flora hops, lightly toasty caramel malts. And the taste is identical on the palate. Not much else to say. I didn’t notice any ashy or burnt qualities personally, which for my palate might’ve actually been a nice spin (though burnt malt notes get you a little out of amber territory)

Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly prickly on the tongue, very crisp

It’s an average amber, better than any macro, underwhelming by modern craft beer drinker standards"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.52,"Pours spot-on amber. Amber amber. Tiny bit hazy. The head recedes quickly and leaves spotty lacing for whatever that's worth. Smells quite decent, orchard fruit, maybe apple, not too far off what you'd expect from a British amber ale. There's also a very subtle toasty aroma. Unfortunately it smells better than it tastes. The flavours are understated. More of that orchard fruit, but unfortunately none of that quintessentially British marmalade flavour. There is some gently bittering hops to balance it out. There is also a strange ashy flavour. Other reviewers described this beer as very biscuity, but I don't find that. It tastes somehow slightly burt and, well, ashy. That is subtle but not very pleasant, and the more you focus on it the more it irks. The mouthfeel is all right, no complaints. Overall it's not a bad beer but I'd only consider it one or two steps up from the average American macro swill. At least this has a bit of character."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.52,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by April 10th yikes a little old but I'll adjust scores.

On the pour a white 2 finger head forms that quickly recedes back down to a 2mm head. Color is about as spot onto amber as you can get and there's a decently lively carbonation. No haze. Light lacing.

Smell is a bit old, but beyond the light skunkiness it reminds me of what I can only describe as belgian light beer. All I can really detect is the old hops and yeast not a lot of malt character here.

Taste is quite similar to the nose. There is some sweetness coming from the malt but it is mostly covered by the yeast character which is quite bright and belgian tasting, but not as strong as traditional belgian beer. Some malt aftertaste as would be expected from an amber. Not a bad flavor but slightly boring.

Feel is a bit light for the style. Definitely can see that it was competing with macros back in the day it's slightly heavier than a lager but it clears the palate fast and has a slight drying effect.

Overall this beer is better than I remember it but the flavors are quite subtle. Apart from the aged hops there's nothing off or offensive about this and it's very easy to drink but only a step or two up from traditional American macros. In Colorado this almost feels like a local macro. I wouldn't seek it out but I'd choose it over a few beers for sure"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.64,"It's just not New Belgiums best imo, and it's not the greatest amber ale I've endulged into at the same range. I'd state an average at best."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,4,"Look: Nearly clear reddish amber with a creamy looking head that retains well and eventually settles, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked bread, light toffee notes, wafts of dough, caramel, lightly toasted grains, and some malt sweetness
Taste: Caramel-dipped bread and tons of it starts things off as some doughy notes and toffee filter in behind. These components continue to develop and deepen along with some toasted grains and closes how it started
Mouthfeel: Full, pretty smooth, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and smooth finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic in its own right and a tasty and well-made Amber ale to boot. Probably not too exciting for some but it’s a great no-nonsense, easy-drinking, malty beer that is nice to have readily available pretty much anywhere and inexpensive to enjoy"
Fat Tire Amber Ale,4.21,"Great tasting beer. Smooth, malty, good carbonation, and really nice flavor."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.97,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at roughly 50 - 55 degrees. One and a half finger light tan head on an aggressive pour. Clear amber-brown color. Some lacing that fades.

S - Sweet malt up front. Creamy/buttery scent. Some light bread as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet buttery caramel malts. Light Biscuit. No bitterness, all straightforward flavor. A bit of toastiness as it warms up.

F - Good buttery medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation.

O - This is a good straightforward beer. The flavors are a basic caramel/biscuit malt, and there is no bitterness. This is a very pleasing beer that I would always choose ahead of the American mass market beers. In fact, I would classify this as one of my standard beers. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to everyone."
Fat Tire Amber Ale,3.72,"Color is a dark amber that is translucent. Pour was nice with a small head that dissipated really quickly, leaving little bits of disconnected lace on the glass. I noticed the aroma instantly while pouring with the phenolic aroma characteristic of a Belgian style ale. Taste is very crisp, and notably well balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and yeasty flavors. For a bBelgian style ale, it is somewhat muted, but in a way I think works very well for an easily drinkable rendition of this style. Overall, a very solid beer, I think the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because the style in general is not one of my favorites."
Double Stack,4.28,On tap @Seattle Georgetown location.
Double Stack,4.4,"Pint can received from @snaotheus in Bif14

Brewers notes: Double Stack is our Imperial Breakfast Stout fermented with an irresponsible amount of maple syrup & aged on whole bean Sumatra from our friends at Clutch Coffee.

Pours a black motor oil ,one finger brown foam cap recedes to a ring

Aroma is maple syrup, fresh roast coffee

Taste is fresh ground coffee, maple syrup , roasted malts

Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, hint of coffee acridness, bit of booze

Good beer"
Double Stack,5,"Pours a deep brown/black color with a thick tan colored head that sticks around and has some nice lacing down the glass. This beer smells like maple pancakes and a cup of coffee from a serious distance. Up close it's fresh maple, a great cup of coffee, and somehow the sweetness of pancakes. Taste is a smooth coffee, roasted malts, toasted pancake followed by sweet maple and finished off with a sweet coffee finish. Smooth, full feeling, perfect amount of carbonation. Incredible."
Double Stack,4.95,"Yummy! Coffee, maple syrup, abv is very well hidden."
Double Stack,4.6,"16 oz can dated 01/06/2021
Oh Holy Father the aroma as i cracked this open!
Natural maple syrup, pancakes, honey and sweet coffee.
Wow.
And it aint a bad looker either. Black body and beautiful inch thick creamy tan head.
Taste not as sweet as one ( me) would expect but it has all the taste profile of a down home old style diner pancake feed.
Mouth feel is thick and silky. Not one to have multiples off.
Great beer for the style"
Double Stack,4.54,"Smells like delicious pancakes. Tastes complex and intriguing, with hints of coffee and maple. Really smooth and creamy. If I changed anything, it would be more maple and less coffee, but then, I LOVE sweet stuff. Overall a great beer!"
Double Stack,4.63,"Look: dark, almost black ,small tan head with good lacing
Smell: I get the coffee, then maple, lot's of maple
Taste: sweet, day old coffee, followed by maple with hints of vanilla and roast
Feel: full, smooth with a touch of carbonation.
Not really a fan of maple stouts, but this is quite good."
Double Stack,4.47,"Beer #1600 on BA is another beauty.

Brew #8 from the Hop Culture Juicy Brews box, a 16oz can poured into a glass coffee mug.

A: Moderately thick black pour; certainly dense and opaque but not the thickest stout ever. Capped by a creamy mocha head.

S: Delicious, decadent, rich coffee and maple syrup character. Chocolatey notes as well. The coffee isn't acrid or bitter, just smooth and rich and plays well with the maple syrup sweetness.

T: Yeah, so easy to drink - this is literally my wheelhouse. Just enough sugary maple syrup to be rich and decadent without being cloying; roasted malt profile bolsters up that sweetness, and the fresh coffee shines through with a breakfast-y feel to it.

MF: Again, not the biggest stout I've seen or tried but big enough, and the body stands up to the adjuncts.

O: Just delicious and darn near perfect for a maple syrup coffee stout."
Double Stack,4.46,"Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour.

Smell - Maple syrup stood out in the nose but there was some bitterness to lend a sense of balance.

Taste - The maple was huge, complemented by a dry bready backbone. A bit of charred dark coffee lent a sense of balance. The sweetness fades in the finish leaving a light coffee bitterness.

Mouthfeel - The body seemed a bit thin for a sweet stout, but it had stickiness.

Overall - The nice thing about this mapled stout was that it was not too heavy."
Double Stack,4.49,"Brownish black with two fingers of brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: huge maple syrup from the local diner with coffee bean, mild chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Reminds me a lot of Mikerphone's imperial SLBS extra maple variants. Feel is lighter and not syrupy at all though, roasted and malty if anything, amazing given the huge maple presence. Would love to try this in a barrel! A classic that is worth the hype for a great maple fix without saturating the palate with sweetness"
Double Stack,4.56,"Huge sugary maple nose, like someone spilled a bottle of Syrup. Full bodied, super slick & smooth mouthfeel. Taste is significantly more coffee-forward than expected, with the maple really coming through on the finish. Hides 11% ABV incredibly well."
Double Stack,4.59,Maple bomb for sure. Can get overwhelming if you are killing a 16oz on your own.
HefeWeizen,5,"I loved it! Delicious!!!! I had it on tap at Duddley’s Draw in College Station, Texas. Very smooth— I would but again. Lovely!!! The taste was exemplary and defining of Hefe style beers. You cannot go wrong with this Texas beer."
HefeWeizen,4.45,"Wow - this one hits like Mike Tyson in a tutu. I mean, it has power like one of the greatest, but also restraint and smoothness like Robert Mitchum courting Jane Greer in “Out of the Past.” Live Oak HefeWeizen is beyond complex thought; it’s a sunset… where there should be nothing to think about - only to take in the beauty that it is.

Oh."
HefeWeizen,4.51,Hefeweizen pours cloudy with a big head and is strong smelling of spice. The taste is very nice. The clove and banana are strong and very good. Mouthfeel is very easy drinking. Goes down smooth and you'll want some more. Overall I would have these in the fridge all the time. Still not available in the DFW area. Friends brought some back from San Antonio. Thanks Steven.
HefeWeizen,3.53,"I try, but hefeweizen's just aren't my style. That's not the beer's fault though, so I defer to others on how good of a hefeweizen this is. Definitely taste the banana, clove, and some wheat. I look forward to trying it on tap in person in Austin, though."
HefeWeizen,4.88,"Literally, this is perfection in a glass. Perfectly balanced. Wheat, banana, and clove flavors in the correct proportions. None of the flavors dominate, they blend in harmony. Not just world class, it's Texas class.

Tip: if you fly into Austin, the brewery is just across Highway 71 from the airport. Worth the trip to get this one fresh on tap, and get a 6 pack, or case to go."
HefeWeizen,4.08,"12 oz can, poured into a weissglass at ~40 degrees F. Canning date 12/8/21, enjoyed 2/18/22.

L: Pours a cloudy, nigh opaque straw gold, where I can still see the shadows of my fingers on the other side of the glass. Formed almost no head, even with an aggressive pour, though the can did have a mild dent in it.

S: Ripe wheat, bubblegum, pear, and banana waft out of the glass. A rather promising aroma for a hefe.

T: Not unlike the nose, and yet it is. Wheat bread mingles with clove and vanilla, with some bubblegum and pear in the backdrop as support.

F: Opens full and fluffy, but experiences something of a watery breakdown at the finish.

O: Quite a solid hefe, especially for a US-brewed one. I get the hype, though sadly due to said hype, I find myself slightly underwhelmed. This comes in second to Dancing Man for me as legendary US hefes go."
HefeWeizen,4.34,Draft pint in the Austin airport Saxon Pub. Bright yellow gold with minimal tight bubble white head. Aroma of clove. Soft mouth with a spicy finish. Taste is banana and clove. Very refreshing and highly Bavarian. Lovely beer.
HefeWeizen,4.67,From a can. Cloudy golden color with an inch of foamy white head. Smells of bread and cloves. Medium body and creamy feel. Bready flavors with the characteristic banana and clove notes. Mild bitterness on the finish. One of the best all-around Hefeweizens I've had. Would probably guess it was German if tasted blind.
HefeWeizen,4.5,"Well its that rare time of review: When you get to write a review for the single beer you think is best in style. Here we are.

Pours a cloudy dark yellow with full on 1"" of white head. Looks more dense than your typical hefeweizen. The aroma hits nicely, light bubblegum, less vanilla and even less banana, plenty of creamy wheat. All that bullshit spice rack is yeeted back to Europe.

Taste is a flavorful yet easy going brew. Chock full of wheat, a hint of straw and vanilla, man the mouth feel here is ultra smooth. All the best wheat and yeast notes combined at last. Carbonation might be lower than normal, but it suits this beer just right. Huge fan of when a beer is quite light and easy to drink, but then has copious amounts of desired flavors.

You won't believe how quick 12oz of this goes down. Its better than anything hefeweizen I've had from Germany or anywhere else in the world. This is an every time purchase when I come across it."
HefeWeizen,4.41,"Review 1553
I have enjoyed this beer from Live Oak, excellent Heffe. I had 12 cans; this is the last one. I served beer in a wheat glass at 44 degrees. An off-white creamy and foamy head with excellent retention was created from the pour. The slow head dissipation left no lacing on the glass. Pale gold with a straw yellow hue charting around SRM 4. The clarity is somewhat cloudy; I was expecting more cloudiness.

I first detect wheat, cloves, banana, and straw. Nosing further, I recognize crackers, biscuits, a touch of floral, and white pepper.

I taste wheat, cloves, banana, straw, floral esters, white pepper, crackers, and biscuit.

The mouthfeel of the beer is creamy and a touch of hops spiciness.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-low carbonation, and medium finish.

This Heffe is excellent. I have enjoyed consuming this beer and look forward to trying their other products. A must-try for any beer lover."
HefeWeizen,2.14,"It could of just been the two pcks I grabbed at the Store but the smell of the lid of the can would make me gag every time I began to drink, I closed my nose and actually wouldn’t have the smell taste on my mouth, I am truly sorry for a Bad review because your Hefeweizen brought me back to times in KITZGEN!!!"
HefeWeizen,4.5,DLD - 5/18/2019
HefeWeizen,5,A Hefe done right. This beer makes Texas proud
HefeWeizen,4.27,"Canned on 10/5/20; consumed on 12/20/20

Pours a cloudy, pale lemon yellow body topped with multiple fingers of pillowy, white foam; good head retention leaves a chunky half-finger of cap, a large, frothy collar, and webs of soapy lacing circling the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with bright clove sporting a fervent minerality underneath while bubblegum esters accent; hints of vanillin over the middle guide toward honeyed straw on the back end of the bouquet into stale white bread, fresh moss, resurgent clove, and delicate bubblegum sweetness to close.

Taste features honeyed white bread, clove, and a drying straw character upfront; a crisp, wheaty mid-palate deepens subtly with light bread crusts, grassy tones, and peppery vanillin on the finish; vanillin, clove, and white bread intermingle and linger long past the swallow.

Mouthfeel brings a light-medium body lifted with ample, fluffy carbonation dying down with a generous spritz over the mid-palate, where more drying, light, and flaky characteristics show into the back end; a textured 'snap' highlights the finish.

An almost savory clove overtones a detailed bubblegum and vanilla-laden sweetness, drying to a crispness fully unifying these elements in simplicity; the result is a hefeweizen as deeply flavorful as it is endlessly sessionable."
HefeWeizen,4.48,"This lager satisfies the longing for a real toasty wheat with a bite to bark about. The aftertaste doesn’t linger; quickly reverting to a sweet orientation.
Doesn’t float Guiness; my real test for a lager; but makes up for masking itself as a light wheat in the pour. Just one in many of beers lined up for my October Fest Review for 2020."
Dark Lord,4.42,"Pours a deep dark brown with moderate cappuccino head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin ring around the edge of the glass.

Big aromas that burst from the bottle upon opening. Sweet milky coffee, dates, stewed fruits. A little charred food sits in behind.

Sweet vanilla hits the tongue first. It’s followed by coffee, much milder dates/figs/raisins. The sweetness stays for the duration, but isn’t over the top or unwanted. Again, in the background there is a charred food/ashy quality that I like. Not boozy in the least.

This is a big bodied beer. Thick without verging too far into syrupy territory. Long finish.

I really enjoyed this beer I’ve heard about for so long. Very glad to have tried it."
Dark Lord,4.34,"2015 maroon wax. Black with small head. Nose has umami notes, charcoal grill in a good way. Taste more chocolatey and sweet, molasses, booze, fig, cocoa powder. Big body and low carb. 7 years old and amazing."
Dark Lord,4.59,"2016 version - one of the best stouts I’ve had in a long while. Smooth, a unique taste, and a perfect mouthfeel. I immediately want to put out my own feelers to get more variants to try, and some fresher versions to compare with this most excellently 6 year aged version."
Dark Lord,4.38,"2019 vintage.

An aggressive pour resulted in a small amount of short-lived head that once gone left behind a cool looking swirl. Nice legs. Color is dark brown with a hint of light showing through around the very edges.

Aroma is fantastic and bursts from the glass. It's sweet with plenty of vanilla. There are some underlying notes that I'm having trouble distinctly naming, but they add a nice depth to the aroma.

Taste is really nice, and quite complex. There's a roastiness that wasn't apparent on the nose, with the vanilla & sugar present but well balanced. Hints of fig lurk in the background. Overall, it's plenty sweet but hovers just under the threshold where it would be too much. Feel is medium full. Very smooth, and low carb. An easy sipper.

Overall, this is excellent."
Dark Lord,4.24,"2020 Vintage

Pours pitch black, oily and viscous. A thin, weak mocha colored head forms on the beer momentarily before dissipating leaving no residual head behind. The head retention is not great, but otherwise its a nice looking beer. The aroma on this is interesting. Initially I got dark fruits when I poured it - lots of prune, raisin and even some port, along with a lovely vanilla note. As Im sitting here sipping it, I am getting much more of this umami, almost soy sauce aroma on this one. Now that I have got that on the brain I cannot shake it. That being said, there are some notes of roasted malts, barley, coffee, and vanilla. There is a certain sweetness to the beer that is clearly present on the nose.

The taste is very complex with a lot going on with this beer. So there are the notes of roasted malts, with notes of dark fruits - prunes, raisin, port wine - all coming in. There is a surprising level of sweetness to this beer that accentuates those fruity notes. As those move across the palate there are notes of fruity coffee, and some piney hops. The finish is where that umami/soy character on the nose comes in on the flavor. The finish then has that umami soy with a slight salty note - although that may just be my mind playing tricks on me from that soy flavor. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish as well with some light piney notes. Feel is medium bodied but rather viscous. Moderate carbonation.

Overall a complex and delicious Russian imperial stout from Three Floyds. I can certainly see why this beer earned the reputation it enjoys in the craft beer community. That being said, I can also see why it does not have the same cache it once had. Its an old school beer that just does not seem to fit in the current stout trends. Thank you so much @ovaltine for sharing this one with me."

Dark Lord,4.86,"Green with sparkles wax - 2017 - enjoyed July 2021.
Poured pitch black with a burnt coffee color head and lacing. The aroma was milder than expected but still very good; malts and coffee and dark cocoa, no hops found.
The taste was able to meet my elevated expectations. Of stouts I have had, I don’t think that I have had one better and I’m not sure I’ve had it’s equal. All the malts and coffee and cocoa (flavors from the malts and hops as no additives were used to my understanding) merge into a flavor that fills your mouth and makes you want more.
The feel was excellent, a bit thinner than I expected but that was when I still thought it was BA, which it apparently isn’t.
OA - outstanding stout. The only knock is that it’s so freaking hard to get."

Super creamy, full body, tons of chocolate and roasted malts. Coffee note is mild in both aroma and taste. No soy sauce anywhere; super smooth, thick, oily and full body. No alcohol burn but a nice warmth on the finish. This bottle was only slightly aged but I still have a 2nd in the cellar which I'll age for many more years ;)"
Dark Lord,4.76,"2020 bottle purchased from a private collection for $25. Super excited i found it. I like the mystique surrounding this beer. Only available once a year. Only available at the brewery in Indiana. Rated super highly. Many derivative versions that are also rated highly, if not higher and single bottles that trade for hundreds of dollars in private circles on the internet. The multicolored waxes that adorn each year's vintage. The black wax that adorns mine. It's my son's birthday, so that seems like a good occasion to drink it.

Poured out a heavy dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy one inch head that dissipates into a ring around the glass. Scents of dark raisins and other fruits, a bit of vanilla. The smell isn't very strong, rather on the weak side so i had to swirl my glass several times to release the aromas. Upon sipping, I'm greeted by raisin and rich sweet chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Perhaps a chocolate covered cherry. Notes of char and leather are present. Coffee is used in this brew but it's not too strong. The brew is mostly a sweet wash, with just a little bit of bitterness to balance it, hovering on the back end as it washes down my throat. Dark Lord is thick and syrupy, just the way I love my stouts, and sticks to my lips, sweetening them long after the swallow. Overall this is a beer to enjoy as a meal in and of itself, as it is hearty and rich, bold and strong at 15%ABV.

I've read that this stout was there before stouts really came into their own, and that the overall field has risen to meet the standards this beer once set. It's better than some stouts, like i like it better than Old Rasputin, but in fact it is comparable in overall savory flavor to some Hoppin Frog stouts like TORIS. So while once upon a time some may have journeyed far and wide to experience this flavor, i think one can obtain beer just as good as this without searching too far from home. However, what an experience! And I feel like I've now joined a secret club. The Dark Lord club."
Dark Lord,4.22,"Bottle, 2009 vintage, kindly shared by gunnar. Black colour, hardly any head. Aroma of heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee and liquorice. Intense flavour of roasted malts, coffee and liquorice."
Dark Lord,4.16,"Thank you eppie82 for this one!

2019 Vintage (purple/glitter wax) poured into a balloon stem at 50°F.

Pours a deep cola brown - fairly fluid, abd sitting coal black in the glass, with no real head. A swirl forms a dark brown collar and some cling along the glass.

Nose: Big, bold roast lends some baker's chocolate, cacao, burned toffee, brown sugar, and a deep, almost savoury character. Yes, I understand where the ""soy sauce"" descriptor comes from. A bit of a meaty character, with some char and marmite, but this seems to be a product of the heavy roast. Some underlying dried cherry dark fruit. Definitely unique.

Palate: Before I start, I will say that the savoury soy sauce note is strictly limited to the aroma. It doesn't show up here. Moving on. A few things stand out first. One, this stout is sweet. Very sweet. That unique concentrated cane flavour of the Indian sugar is present, along with the sweetness. Lots of sweet, tarry molasses, brown sugar, and even a blackstrap rum thing going on. The vanilla is definitely lending character, but not like a ""vanilla stout"" - it's tame, identifiable, and well-balanced. I'm not getting any coffee. The malt itself is so classically Russian, with big, super dark roast, earthy char, and all those bold roasty notes. The hops are also very old school, with earthy, leafy bittering hop character meshing with the roast. Approaching the finish, vanilla fades, and the blackened roast and earthy hops take over, pushing some sweetness out, lending some earthiness and char, but very little bitterness. The finish highlights this, with a touch of molasses.

Mouthfeel/Body: While it didn't appear so on the pour, wow is this one fudgy. Full-bodied, heavy, thick, and chewy, while not crossing the line into syrup territory. It isn't close to BBT or Assassin thick, but it's certainly in that same vein of luscious and fudgy. There's actually some nice, fizzy, albeit fine effervescence that pokes through a bit. Definitely some residual stickiness.

Overall: This is an interesting stout. Today, we're inundated with all of these mega pastry stouts brewed with half a bakery. While there are ""adjuncts"" in here - vanilla, coffee, and Indian sugar, those flavours are dialed way back, to the point of almost feeling like a plain stout. It's the sweetness that really stands out. On top of that, it's the only dessert stout I've had that retains that classic Russian Imperial flavour profile, and that's unique. Picture a dessert Russian Imperial Stout. If that sounds good, then this will likely deliver."
Dark Lord,4.29,"Very solid Russian Imperial. Definitely not the whale I chased, but very solid either way. A bit of an odd aftertaste, but enjoy the front forward and solid."
Dark Lord,4.71,"I love this beer. The old school whale. I still want to drink it and I still open these up for special occasions. I do think it's not the best fresh, so it's always nice to have older years on hand to drink."
Dark Lord,4.61,"Some people call this Soy sauce, which I cannot agree to at all. Even the bass beer itself is really really good. Tons of everything and obviously very great balance. (having said that, you oughta try one of the DL variants!)"
Dark Lord,4.73,Finally got my hands on a bottle this year. As good as expected. Surprised by the amount of dark fruits
Dark Lord,4.38,"2020 vintage sampled day 2 of availability. Nose is prominent malty roast and dark chocolate, light coffee. No soy notes like some people mention in previous years. A bit thinner than past years, but still oily thick in feel and appearance. Flavors are actually discernible when fresh: char, malt, molasses, vanilla, coffee on the finish. Not a sugar bomb like it has come to be known for."

Anabasis,4.85,"Drank this right after trying DO ADWTD. This one is clearly an American barleywine after having something much sweeter before it. Although it is still sweet, you can taste a hoppiness in the background. The barrel character is perfect and the body is thick, but not syrupy. World class!"

Bud Light,1.97,"16 oz draft pour at a Twins game. Looks like a light lager. Smells vaguely of hops and malt. The flavor isn't terrible, but it is very watery. It was free. I drank less than half of it. No interest in revisiting this half-beer in the future."

Bud Light,2.78,"Poured from a 25oz can best by Oct 27th 2022

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest."
Bud Light,2.2,"how i have been waiting for this day. in ireland, bud light is a relatively new addition to the market, and where it is sold it’s usually sold in 4 packs. now im hardly buying 4 cans of most beer, let alone this, but sure enough today in my local shop there were loose cans, i didn’t really know what to expect from this to be honest, and to be honest it really isn’t as bad as i was expecting, there’s nothing particularly astringent about it, that being said it is some pretty cruddy lager, it’s just a vacuum of flavour, white bread malt and a faint sweetness, no bitterness, medium to high carbonation, reasonably drinkable but incredibly thin and watery, yeah it’s not good, but it’s not the worst either"
Bud Light,1.11,"if you have to drink a mass produced light beer, this isnt the worst one of the bunch... but that isnt saying much."
Bud Light,1.18,Absolutely terrible
Bud Light,2.85,"The first time I had a Bud Light, I wanted a Bud Light Lime. You can do worse in terms of beer, I know folks who treat this drink with anathema. The fact of the matter is that you can consume a Bud Light and drive sober by the time you've finished a savory Mexican dish."
Bud Light,2.27,"Pours light golden with sparkling water like tiny carbonization fizz in lieu of frothy head. No complex taste, aroma or flavor to note. Not complaining since we are chilling and vibing at the Simi Valley Happy face Music festival with this “free” bottomless light lager “beer” include with admission. Better than water? Cheers!"

Bud Light,1.43,"No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass. There's no head, no glass lacing, almost no aroma and it's one of the most transparent amber colors you'll ever see. There are vague taste references to yeast, malt, hops and alcohol, without any discernable hierarchy. There is some decent carbonation and it's blandly drinkable. Still, it's not worth the time, calories or expense, unless it's free. In that case, reread the other two reasons not to drink it."
Bud Light,2.86,"I decided to pick up a can at the LCBO in Ontario 473ml at 4% in Canada brewed by Labbats brewery.

Bud Light,4.16,"Very enjoyable.
Good for those days when I want to drink 3 or more beers without ""paying the price"" the next day.

Finestkind IPA,4.24,"You’ve been in class all day; tissues, pathways, mechanisms ring through your head with no sign of slowing soon. Its 7:30pm, and the sun has already near set across the Somerville sky. Brain exhausted and eyes strained, you close out your last Zoom call, shut your laptop and make your way to the balcony outside for some fresh air. To your immediate surprise, instead of the typical metro humidity and busyness, you’re met with a cool, crisp, natural breeze. Fall is here. The North is calling. You immediately know what to do ; you traipse back inside to their fridge and crack a Smutty. The Finest Kind. Notes of pine and grass complete the symphony; the briskness of arriving autumn tapered by the flowing IPA approaching your extremities... warmth. You don’t just feel home, you ARE home. That is what Smuttynose’s Finest Kinda does for you, and for that reason it has earned a spot in my fridge. Cheers."
Finestkind IPA,3.84,"Pours... well I don't know. I had 3 of them within their own cans. The aroma is hop-forward with a hint of citrus, maybe pineapple?

Finestkind IPA,4.03,"Appearance:
A misty, dark yellow; the color of a sunflower’s iris. Proffers up a big, soapy, head of white that skips town before the party starts. Leaves no trace of lace.

Bouquet:
A hushed duet of semi-sweet hops and tiny speckles of pineapple. Fresh citrus cuts in front of these quiet performers, playing a lurid yet catchy jazz solo which nearly tunes them out.

Feel:
A slick, medium body with a nearly impalpable booze finish that has the gentle warmth of a springtime sunrise. The carbonation plays a subtle yet imperative, supporting role.

Taste:
A drizzle of pineapple syrup over a fistful of tangy, citrus hops. Any potential acidic bitterness is bumped out of the picture by a biscuity, malt backbone."

Pale Ale,3.73,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50 degrees. Pours a clear amber color with an off-white 1/2 finger head on a tame pour. Minor lacing that doesn’t stay. Head quickly reduces down to a light film.

S - Pleasant pine hops and citrus zest. Very nice light flavor scents overall.

T - Taste follows scent. Sweet fruit zest paired with piney and floral hops. Very light and refreshing. There’s a nice sweet flavor that I can’t pinpoint that comes through as well. On second thought, it’s grapefruit. Very nice addition.

F - Not a lot of carbonation and a lighter mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a solid beer. Very good for regular drinking, and a standout for outdoors and camping. The sweet and bitter flavors provide a nice mix. I am by no means a hophead, but this is a nice, acceptable amount of hops and bitterness. It’s in my regular rotation and I would definitely recommend it to others."
Pale Ale,4.74,"Sierra Nevada pale ale was introduced in 1980, this is a historic craft beers of the world that helped shape the craft beer game that we know & love. This is also one of the first beers I've ever tried and the review will be a bit biased as a result.

Look: Thin 1.5 finger - off white/ cream color head and a cloudy orange in color.

Smell: Smells wonderful - citrus, barley malt, sweet piney aroma (I wish I could make a perfume out of this fragrance).

Taste: Very refreshing - hop forward with a punch of citrus and pleasantly bitter hops, piney and grapefruit notes, mild caramel-like sweetness and crisp clean water.

Feel: So smooth - Medium soft & fluffy ale body with a mildly sweet and semi-dry finish.

Overall, it's an exceptional beer!

ABV: 5.6% | IBU: 38"
Pale Ale,4,A perfect every day beer.
Pale Ale,3.9,"Pours a deep-ish golden-orange, with a nice finger and a half, foamy white head. The head has lasting impact in my glass, lasting the entirety of the drink, well over 15 minutes. Long lines of bubbles run up the glass. Looks amazing. Thick generous lacing lines the entirety of the glass as it empties.

Smells of wheat, bread, floral hops with a touch of bitterness. It’s clean and fresh smelling. Some piney notes, notes of grassy straw. General zesty citrus in the background. It’s as clean and classic as you can get.

Some have described SNPA as a mix between an APA and an IPA, but this is just straight up APA for me with mild balancing bitterness. Gentle floral hop, grassy flavours wash over the tongue before revealing straight up sweet caramel malt, some tasty bready wheat notes, and the citrus I notice here, mostly grapefruit. Gentle but tasty. It’s so straight up clean that it almost feels more complex than it is. SNPA has never been described as the absolute boldest, biggest smash your face flavour beer, but it isn’t any worse for it. When you want that clean, crisp, yet flavourful and subtle APA, this is the taste you think of in your mind. It is your classic example personified in an actual beer.

It’s well carbonated but not super strong; resulting in a nicely smooth, mildly creamy sip. Subtle medium long finish, that leaves just a hint of bitterness and lightly roasted grains on your tongue. Finishes clean and semi-dry. It’s so easy drinking and clean I’d consider this light bodied myself.

When thinking and comparing this beer to others, I want to give it a higher ranking than I ultimately put here. There is more aspects to some beers than just the categories here. SNPA is a work-horse, a beer that can be easily drank all night, be enjoyed by quite literally every single beer drinker no matter what style preference you have, and is a super clean straight up benchmark of the style."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.59,"Poured from a 12oz can best by 11-30-2022

On the pour a thre finger head forms in my spiegelau IPA glass. The head has very good retention and becomes slightly rocky after a few minutes. Carbonation is fine and highly active.

Aroma is light woth the huge head Overton, but a slightly resinous and dank hop is present with a nice big fruity compliment. Some fermentation notes are present bringing a bit more funk.

Taste follows the aroma with a bit more fermentation, but overall this is a super drinkable hoppy ale, almost dangerously easy to put down. Very light bready malts come out at the end shrouded in the herbal and bitter hops that have lost a lot of the fruity notes once actually drank.

Feel is almost surprisingly light and drinkable. Palate is left with a dry feeling and the hops do stick around for a while, but the malts are much more present in feel and finish despite the lightness at first.

Overall this was decent, amd a nice intro to the happier side for beginners, but for some reason I was expecting a bit more outta this. I probably shouldn't have had their G13 IPA before this one though."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.85,"Poured a clear light golden color with a white foamy head. The smell was of malt and hops. A decent middle of the road pale ale that's a good thirst quencher, especially on hot and humid days."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.62,"Poured a golden color with a good foam head, some retention.
Smells of citrus and herbal notes as well.
Juicy with melon, apricot and oranges.
Decent carbonation, clean finish."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4.52,"420 EPA is my go to. Good taste of hops easy to swallow even at 9 am after you've caught that 40"" snook. Low bitterness."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.68,"Picked up a can when I was in Milwaukee last month. I guess they're part of the Miller/Coors/global portfolio now. Works for me.

Pours a dark golden color with a light amber aspect to it. Midnight wheat? Is that what gives this a slightly darker SRM hue than your average pale ale? (Much less ""extra"" pale ale) 1/4"" white head. The aroma is straight up C hop throwback mode. I appreciate it. Standard citric bitter rind and pine. Sure its sentimental.

The taste smacks similarly, although the malt bill is a smidge less ""thick"" or hefty than the appearance would suggest. Its a by the numbers C hopped pale ale that goes with a lighter non crystal malt aspect to separate it from the master that is SNPA. It really does tap into that Sierra Nevada vibe, somewhere between their historic ""maltier compared to contemporary beers"" and classic C hop crispness. I'd certainly pick up 6 of these every summer if I had the option."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.69,"Pours a slightly chill-hazed light gold. Excellent fluffy white head and lacing.

Aromas are a mixture of pale and caramel malts and citrus. Just a touch of grassy and floral hop.

Pale mildly tart malts at the start and in midstream. Some biscuity character, along with lemon and orange. Then some grass and pine arrive, but never get to IPA volume. Very balanced. Maybe a touch watered.

Medium light bodied. Just this side of crisp. Very drinkable.

This is a solid APA."
420 Extra Pale Ale,3.72,"Appearance: slightly hazy gold with fluffy white head, good retention.

Aroma: Light citrus, grassy

Flavor: Citrus, lemon and oranges. Restrained bitterness. Dry.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Short try finish.

Overall: This is a very light beer made for mild flavors and aroma. Not the boldest Pale Ale, but not really supposed to be. Tastes good. Crushable."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4.03,"Best by August 22nd 2022.

Bought at Liquor Shed in Casper.

Pours a fairly clear pale gold, good puffy head of foam, lacing is ok.

Smells of citrus hops, toasted malt, an overall balanced nose. Can conditioned, says it on the can. Believable.

Nice balance between the citrus hops and toasted malt. Some sweet notes for sure, very much hoppy notes and a dryness that usually accompanies a beer that calls itself Extra Pale Ale. Think Sierra Nevada Torpedo.

Good mouthfeel, very good drinkability.

Nice to have this option in town."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4,"Look: Light orange in color and the pour yields a huge billowing white head that eventually settles to a pillow, leaving behind great lacing
Aroma: Navel oranges, lemons, lime, floral hop notes, some sweet malt, candied dried fruit, and some grassy notes
Taste: A rush of assorted citrus fruits opens it up and as the hit subsides, floral and grassy hop notes follow suit – I get some Koreanspice viburnum, winter daphne, and Hall’s honeysuckle. Malt is there but light in presence and closes with more lemon-lime-led citrus fruit
Mouthfeel: Full but light, pretty clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and finishes clean and slightly soft with zero dryness
Overall: I’m digging this one. I’ve heard of this beer for years, mainly here on BA, but never had it so when I heard they were distributing in Oregon, I had to try one and it’s tasty. It’s a fine Extra Pale Ale with a lot of unique citrusy, grassy, and floral notes that set it apart from many others already available and I can definitely see myself getting and keeping this one in rotation as we move into the warm months."
420 Extra Pale Ale,2.6,Can stamped best by 6/18/22. Wondering if something happened since there's a decided funkiness in both smell and taste not consistent with an APA (or most other reviews here) present in both cans so far.
420 Extra Pale Ale,2.12,The new version of 420 is like drinking an IPA poured through an ashtray. Gross.
420 Extra Pale Ale,4.54,"Had this on tap at a local restaurant. Smell was somewhat floral. The head was about 1 finger, but lasted really well. Carbonation was just about perfect. Really easy drinking that went great with my meal (brisket). One I'll definitely get again."
420 Extra Pale Ale,5,"I know it's technically not an IPA, but as far as pale ales and IPAs go this is by far my favorite. Absolutely great flavor, easy to drink, nothing wrong with it."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4.21,"Golden with a 1.5"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is floral, pine, orange, grapefruit, grass

Taste is pine, orange zest, grapefruit, caramel, resin.

Medium body, lively carbonation. Dry finish.

One of the best Pale Ales."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4,"12oz can EB date 4/28/22 into a 16oz pint glass.
L: Pours almost clear bright light gold, good carbonation with a 1.5"" soapy white head which recedes to a thick skin. Some sticky skeletal lacing & light banding.
S: Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon rind, caramelized malts and a suggestion of spicy peppery hops. Gently dank & citrusy overall.
T: Lemon zest, grapefruit, pineapple, orange. A hint of non-resinous pine. It is mildly bittersweet, well balanced and finishes cleanly.
F: Semi-juicy, crisp, med-light bodied mouthfeel with a med-fast finish. It has a pleasant & affable flow.
O: Hop frwrd w/out much of a malt profile, I am pleasantly surprised by it's easy drinkability. A very tasty & well balanced AEPA that is inviting and refreshing. A really good any day of the year beer and it is excellent in it's style."
420 Extra Pale Ale,2.73,"It pours a transparent straw color, with a white head, and sharp hoppy nose. The taste definitely has the traditional sharp hop flavor, but there's a funky flavor that's overpowering everything else. I'm not sure if it's intentional, or if this bottle was skunked. The palate eventually clears, with a small hoppy finish. I would want to try this from another source to see if this is an accurate example."
420 Extra Pale Ale,4,"Has about average carbonation with about the same for the body
Aroma is grqpefruiy,grapefruit, fruit and peel,mild pine,earthy honey
Taste doesn't stray too far from the aroma, very mild malt sweetness with citrus peel bitterness balancing it out.
Very flavorful and enjoyable beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
It Was All A Dream,4.37,"Pours very dark with minimal head, has occasional coconut floaters. Aroma is metallic coconut, boozy bourbon barrel, chocolate. Flavor is dark chocolate, loads of coconut, sweet vanilla, boozy middle, gentle coffee finish accompanied by a pervasive sweet maple flavor. Very thick texture, light carbonation adds to a creaminess. Overall a delicious BA adjunct stout.

It Was All A Dream,4.75,12/9/2020: Poured into a snifter. Nicely thick. Coats my tilted glass. More maple and vanilla than coffee and coconut but this is very very tasty.
It Was All A Dream,4.56,"Batch 1, delicious. Maple and Coconut take the show, Coffee and Vanilla more in the background. So glad to be able to have this great stout. Thanks Tim!"
HopDevil,4.05,"Pours out an amber color with a nice thick head. The taste is somewhat fruity and truly different. Some notes of fruit, like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish. All in all a great tasting beer."
HopDevil,3.73,"Maybe I'm drinking from a mis tapped keg, but this was too malty and dark for me. Wanted a hop bomb, got a malt grenade"
HopDevil,4.1,"Tasty traditional IPA from Victory, this might be my favorite from the brewer. Great balance of hop bite and malt backbone. Would look for this fresh again."
HopDevil,4.15,"This beer pours a clear dark bronze color with significant effervescence and a moderate head that dissipated quite slowly . As expected, there is a strong, fresh, hoppy aroma. The taste is very pleasant; dry and hoppy with caramel undertones. The mouth feel is a bit syrupy, but still refreshing."
HopDevil,3.78,"Good beer, but not my fave"
HopDevil,3.9,"Clear copper leaving a finger of off white head. Aromas of coffee, citrus, and bread. Taste is bold and spicy. Hints of citrus and toffee with a very strong malt backbone. Just a touch of hops and pine. This beer is full bodied and creamy. Nice feel. Overall this a quality offering from Victory. Just a touch too malty for my preference but a solid brew nonetheless"
HopDevil,3.41,"This beer first appeared on my beer radar very early in the game. I didn't even drink yet. It was the summer before college, we were at a buddy’s house and all the Bud Lights were gone. So, my friend stole a Hop Devil out of the home owner’s basement fridge and proceeded to then hurl it across the room. Full beer went smash. Big mess. From that day on the Hop Devil has always been memorable. That being said, I never actually had one until this week. Like Sam Darnald who lurks in the background, it’s an average beer. Solid pine notes, not overwhelming, but a little heavy. Took a little while to get through, but overall OK."
HopDevil,4.31,"Clear copper, nice off white head, excellent retention, great lace. A good looking beer!
Grapefruit, pine, floral, caramelized honey aromas
Grapefruit and caramelized honey flavors
Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation
A real blast from the past. I've started to miss these old school East Coast IPAs."
HopDevil,4.21,"Pours amber with a 1"" cream-colored head, which fades to a wisp. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is citrus, toffee, hay, caramel.

Taste is grapefruit, pine, spice, caramel. Resinous.

Medium bodied, light carbonation. dry, resinous finish.

This is another good Victory IPA."
HopDevil,3.74,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.7%. Clear deep golden to amber to orange colour, moderate white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, but not overwhelming. Hints of orange marmalade. The flavour is surprisingly well balanced and harmonious for something called ""HopDevil"" - hoppy of course, but no devil is at loose here, rather a benevolent HopAngel. Me like!"
HopDevil,4.26,"This set a standard for the East Coast IBU race of a decade ago.
Still a fantastic dank ale."
HopDevil,4.2,"Deep bronze color, good sized head and nice lacing. Citrus aroma with a distinct melon quality. Spicy hops dominate the flavor , but there is balance in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish. This has been consistently well made over many years and remains a personal favorite."
HopDevil,4.44,"A go to of mine for years. A nice deep copper color with reasonable head and lacing. The mouth feel is as good as there is outside of NEIPAs. What makes this one special is its delivery of both malt and hop tastes. As it should be, the slightly sweet malt is up front, followed by a lingering earthy and hoppy finish. This is a really good IPA that I've been drinking regularly for years and I never tire of it."
HopDevil,4.05,"Appears, amber with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a nice cap and lacing.
Smells dank, citrusy, orange, grapefruit, piney.
Taste follows the nose and very hop forward.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a very nice IPA that I would definitely want to drink again."
HopDevil,4.68,"I reviewed this beer about 18 years ago. One of the originals. One of the best in this style. The beer that put Victory on themap.

Copper color with great lacing. Dank hop smell with malt in the background. Slightly piney hops balanced with caramel malts. Still the best balanced. Nice bitter finish.

Still reaching for this quality beer after all these years."
HopDevil,4.34,"I liked this beers. An interesting mix of hops, earthiness, dank, not going for super floral and uber fruit, I'd like to have it again, it was in a mix pack, I remember being surprised."
HopDevil,4.17,"Cloudy copper on the pour, some head that dissipates quickly and lots of lacing. Aroma is very piney, with some fruit and malt. Taste is very hoppy with lingering bitterness as well. This is a very good IPA, but I'd rate some slightly better......like Bell's Two Hearted, Ithaca's Flower Power and Sculpin from Ballast."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.87,Hands down the best beer I’ve ever had!
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.6,"Pours a deep, black with a thin mocha-colored head that dissipates quickly. The aroma gives notes of charred oak, bourbon, dark fruits, dark roast coffee, and vanilla. The flavor is less sharp, and more rich with notes of dark chocolate, espresso, chocolate chip cookie, and oaky bourbon and vanilla. The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors. The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish. Overall, a very flavorful and drinkable beer. One of my favorite BBA Stouts I have ever had, very well balanced flavor and mouthfeel. Highly recommended."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.7,"Uh, nearly perfect"
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.67,"2021 Release - Jet black with considerable tan head on an aggressive pour. Smell of bourbon barrel and light char. Taste is incredibly balanced between barrel and chocolate, no burn. Thicker than I expected on the mouthfeel. Classic Hill, world class BA non adjunct stout"
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.26,"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.

Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.

An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.5,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with some chocolate notes and some vanilla and woody bourbon notes. Taste is a great mix of roasted malt with some black chocolate notes with faint residual sugar notes with some woody bourbon notes with light vanilla, Body is full with a good oily texture and good carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Solid barrel-aged imperial stout with good flavors balance."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.49,"500ml black waxed bottle poured into HF white etched logo Charente glass (aka wine stem ""bulb"" glass).

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.

bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.

Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.

Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke.

Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time.

Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture."
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),4.43,"Consumed 4/27/21

Note: April 2016 batch

Black with some deep, dark brown around the edges, opaque, pours with a small tan head, fades to virtually nothing (not shocking after 5 years)
Deep spectrum of chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet chocolate, brownies, chocolate cake, caramel, molasses, some dark fruit, nice balance with the bourbon, woody notes, oak, some vanilla, lingering sweetness balanced with some barrel dryness
On the light side of heavy, smooth, low carbonation

I believe I have had this beer as many as 3 times since April 2016, but I never reviewed it. Better late than never, and I may never have this beer again. Shocking news: this is an amazing beverage."

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.59,"Canned 11/23/20 and enjoyed on 12/02/20. Pours with some moderate effervescence with some moderate head retention and lacing. Color reminiscent of orange juice. Complex scents of pine, mango, pineapple, fresh cut grass. Similar flavor profile- lots of tropical fruits, orange zest, with some noticeable hop bite. Soft, fluffy mouthfeel. Nice oily bitterness that lingers on the palate. I really enjoy galaxy hopped beers and this is a solid one that drinks bigger than it is, more like a DIPA. Really big and bold flavors."
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.77,"This beer seems to get better and better every year. Trillium will always be my favorite haze brewery, and this is one of their best."
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.18,Grassy with a bitterness spice finish.
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.75,"Can dated 9/15/20. Poured into Trillium tulip shaped glass. Looks like dirty orange juice. Great smell of hops, but not so much as other Trillium DDH varieties I’ve had. Taste is really well balanced — not overpowering with citrus — with a long, ever-so-slightly bitter, lingering finish. Doesn’t stand out in any singular, exaggerated way, but a very nicely balanced IPA. Nicely done."
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.56,"Pours a 1/4” head and lacy suds on top of hazy yellow/orange body. Nice refreshing mouthfeel and the double dry hops comes through in the taste, and just a touch lingering afterwards. Tangerine, kumquat, pineapple, and sweet citrus aroma."
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.4,"L: Super Hazy yellow with a tint of orange and a bubbly head that dissipates leaving modest lacing.

S: Bright and resinous tropical fruits. Mango, peach, and pineapple. The malt showcases itself surprisingly well with some candied bread.

T: Firm bitterness, moves into a huge hop flavor of mango, peach, and pine resin. The malt provides a decent backbone with some candied crystal malt presence.

F: Dry, but somewhat creamy from a generous dose of wheat or oats.

Overall: A stellar NEIPA, insanely hoppy. You must try this beer if you are a hophead."

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.32,"Sweet pineapple, bready/biscuity, and tropical hoppy nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and juicy, slightly malty, tropical hoppy bitter finish. This has really nice depth and mouthfeel for a single! This is good!"

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,4.57,"Look (4.75): nice frothy one finger head. leaves lacing. Super hazy yellow
Nose (4): not sure why, but not very strong from what i can tell. Smells citrusy and bitter/a little dank

Taste (4.75): Citrusy, but can't tell exactly what ""candied"" fruit. More bitterness and hops. Bit of dankness. More dankness than typical NEIPA

Mornin' Delight,4.74,"2022 Variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. Overpowering maple on the nose, and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor.

While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour. Glad I have a bottle left."
Mornin' Delight,4.77,"2021 bottle split 3 ways, was fortunate enough to win this in a charity raffle and wasted no time enjoying it

Look - an aggressive pour into a tulip glass looking like oil with a nice two finger mocha colored head

Smell - the maple, oh the maple! While it dominates, also get some notes of vanilla, toffee and chocolate

Taste - The maple sweetness definitely hits at first bit there is a good balance with some roasty coffee and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Outstanding

Mouthfeel - it's thick, syrupy and coats the mouth nicely

Overall - just an absolute world class beer, my only wish is I would've had some waffles or French toast for brunch to pair with it"
Mornin' Delight,5,"Look: Motor oil. Perfect looking.

Smell: Heavy caramel, butterscotch, maple syrup, chocolate cake, vanilla. Definitely the best smelling stout to ever grace my nose. Amazing.

Taste: Buttery smooth. Maple syrup and caramel notes up front. Soft marshmallow and vanilla. Fades away into nothing. Best stout I've ever had hands down.

Feel: LIke walking on a could.

Mornin' Delight,4.45,"2021 vintage, growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck

Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme

In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat

This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing"
Mornin' Delight,4.06,"Had both 2020 and 2021 on draught. 2020 - the coffee faded quite a bit, the maple is dominant to the point of being a maple bomb. If you like maple in your beer its great. 2021 had lots of coffee on the nose and the flavor. I definitely preferred the fresh one as it had both the coffee and the maple. Good beer."
Mornin' Delight,4.99,This is the perfect blend of maple and coffee. It is very difficult to get the maple syrup correct in a beer. It has the perfect thickness and is probably my favorite non barrel aged beer.
Mornin' Delight,4.98,"#80, so good!"
Mornin' Delight,4.98,"5oz pour at Carmine Street in NYC.

A NEW BAR HAS BEEN SET.

I’m not sure how this is so perfect. Warm without being boozy, sweet but balanced beauty. With all the extras, the backbone is a well developed stout. This is a magic experience.

I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
Mornin' Delight,4.99,"Pure black pour with a huge maple nose. Lots of maple flavor balanced with coffee. Thick, velvety mouthfeel that leaves syrup stickiness. Just a great beer!!"
Mornin' Delight,4.85,"Just a little too sweet for a perfect score, but make no mistake I keep a 4 pack in my fridge at all time !"
Mornin' Delight,4.72,"Had a fresh ten ounce pour on tap into a tulip glass. The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.34,This years batch taste a little different.
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,2.76,"Uninspiring when compared to Gold Standard Spaten. Malt flavor weak, beer clean taste. Hope fine but just No Oompah!"
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.48,Pours a solid golden amber color with finger or two foamy head. Smells of a toasty caramel scented malt. Tastes the same with smoothness similar to a Irish red but slightly different. An absolute fall classic and is loved by most. There is a reason this is a common draft amongst establishments in the fall. Boston does it well with this Sam Adams seasonal.
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.68,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint shaker and had to pour in stages as the head was so aggressive. The color was beautiful copper with the manilla colored head, looks enticing.
The aroma was ideal for a Märzen style, the malts and caramel and touch of spice, oh, this smelled good.
The taste was okay, a letdown after the hard sell- the aforementioned malts were there but rather undefined. It was curious after the aroma was so spot on and the taste just dropped off. Weird.
The feel was excellent, no worries there.
Smooth and so easy to drink.
OA, very strange, parts of this excel but somehow the flavors can’t back the rest up."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,1.18,"Did I just get a bad batch or do I need a tastebud transplant?

It doesn't even smell or taste like beer. I can't even tell you how it tastes as I can't find the words to do so.

I was drinking Bell's Octoberfest last week. Enjoyed it very much.

Thought I would save a few dollars this week, but ending up throwing away $12.99 for Samuel Adams.

Ugh."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.14,"I returned to SA Octoberfest after about 10 years away, and I can't say that the time has done it any favors. I remember a good quality Marzen with a nice flavor profile that, yes, sometimes had its off years, but on the whole was a steady performer in the American O-fest scene.

The only constant from the beer I remember is the great look, a beautiful dark amber. The rest just seems muddled. For me, the taste is a bit off, with a flat malt expression that doesn't have much character or depth, and too much bitterness on the finish. Maybe they've increased the hop bill to meet current tastes? Well it doesn't suite my palate. While nicely medium bodied, it has an unfortunate tendency to syrup-coat your mouth after the swallow.

Would I choose this over a lot of other standard party/bbq offerings? Absolutely. But with so many great, small craft options these days, it might be another 10 years before I buy SA Octoberfest again."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.79,"Had on tap (alledgedly tapped yesterday) at Hoffbrau Bar and Grill in Westminster, CO

On arrival a fine one finger head was present that relatively quickly dissipated to a ring around the rim and very light covering. Carbonation is lazy and fine in a reddish brown amber body. No lacing.

Aroma has some nice lightly estery Germans tyle lager yeast with a very low hopping rate. A nice nutty roasted malt is peeking its head through pretty aggressively.

Taste is similar to the aroma with a low hopping rate, and a surprisingly flavorful but pleasant German style lager yeast that plays a big role here. Once the fermentation character passes a big wave of nutty roasted malts takes over.

Feel is insanely drinkable with a medium body for easy drinking but a bit more body for that oktoberfest. Very soft and smooth. Not the sweetest but the malts are mouthcoating. On the medium finish it starts drying out a bit.

Overall this is a very nice malty oktoberfest. Flavorful and it tastes German. Very light hops as per style, but it doesn't go great with hoppy amber lagers as I just found out."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,1.52,"Created an account just to say that I agree with the review posted by ABeingWhoDrinksBeer in Dec 2021.

Overly malty and enough sweetness to ruin the brew. I also get a hint of chocolate, which doesn't work for me in a beer.

Looks good, but that's about it.

Unfortunately, the Pacific Northwest is awash in IPAs, which makes it hard for someone like me who's not a huge IPA fan to find a decent craft beer that isn't an IPA. I spotted this in Costco and figured, ""I like Sam Adams, how bad could this be?"" and proceeded to buy a case of 36 (!) bottles.

I sure hope one of my buddies like this... I can't bring myself to dump it down the drain."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.75,Equal to the great lakes Oktoberfest
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.93,"An ok entry level Oktoberfest style beer.
It's missing the malt complexity of a true German beer of this style, but overall it's not bad. There's better by far."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,2.83,"I mean, it's just regular Sam Adams but somehow worse"
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,3.93,"Bought pint of draft at a minor league ball game, so I paid way too much for a beer. Rich golden, reddish, tan color with off white foam that diminished after a few minutes. Pleasant aroma and taste was malt leading with a smooth finish. Enjoyable brew, would buy a 6 pk for a better deal."
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,4.68,"I saw this at the store today and had to buy the 12 pack. Excellent beer—good head, medium carbonations, malty with hints of sweetness and slightly bitter."
Triple Sunshine,4.44,"Canned on 11/30/21
L - Pours a hazy golden with a one finger white head. Nice lacing.
S - Tropical combination of grapefruit and orange. However, nothing really overpowering., which is good.
T - follows the nose a bit. Juicy hops. Kind of a hop “pow” at the end but no lingering aftertaste.
F - medium mouth feel and fairly smooth. Some carbonation.
O - A really good beer. I’m glad I had it."
Triple Sunshine,4.5,Pours a hazy gold. Thick foam. Dank aroma. Big hop oil and tropical fruit flavors. Finishes sticky sweet. Slight bitterness. Definitely tastes like sunshine. It certainly brightened my day.
Triple Sunshine,4.75,"Fantastic beer, right up there with Double Sunshine. The only fault here is I think the beer is too big. At 10.5% ABV it's a bit of a commitment. That being said it's a beautiful, flavor packed beer. I really enjoy the Lawson IPAs and I appreciate they don't try to follow the hazy lactose trends. yb"
Triple Sunshine,3.83,"From the can, it pours a slightly hazy gv orange-amber color with a nice white head that lasts and leaves some lacing as you enjoy it. The nose gets a whiff of orange rind and malt. No alcohol extant in the nose. The mouth, gets a double whammy of malt and hops, with a kick. It leaves a light bitterness in the mouth.

A sipping beer."
Triple Sunshine,5,Saw this in the store being a fan of Sip Of Sunshine a golf course favorite. This is amazing. They have out done themselves. At 10.5% it packs a punch.
Triple Sunshine,4.34,"Canned 11/08/21. Let sit out for 15 minutes , before opening.

Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center.

Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma .

Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears.

Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.

Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :)

* Brain Bucket, from Water Street Brewing (Binghamton,NY, not the Milwaukee brewery) . That one lives up to name - Your brain will be in a bucket when you're done with it - all-too-quickly . ;)"
Triple Sunshine,4.96,"Pours a hazy, almost opaque, amber with a thick creamy head that slowly dissipates into a foamy ring. On the nose, tropical fruit, melon, with hints of pine and dank. On the palate, lots of citrus and tropical fruit balanced by a solid malt backbone. Very full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel due to the moderate carbonation. The high ABV adds a warmness on the finish. This is a sipper that develops nicely as it warms. Overall, this is a genre defining beer that might be the best example of an imperial IPA I’ve ever had."
Triple Sunshine,4.74,"Canned one month ago. Poured into a belgian snulip style glass

L: 4.5. Deep amber-orange. Nearly opaque. Thin, creamy white head. Leaves behind alcohol lacing.
S: 4.75. Viney. Resinous. Grapefruit. Pine. Everything you want.
T: 5. This is a style defining beer. Great bitterness. Piney hops. Sweet, malty bite that becomes more apparent as it warms. Nothing negative to be said. Fiver.
F: 3.75. This is where this beer looses some points as it is quite heavy. There is a lite burn. Sip slowly and enjoy.
O: 4.75. This is worth traveling to find. The hype is real for Lawson's. This may be their crown jewel."
Triple Sunshine,4.28,"Look...Light copper yellow with little haze and thin carbonated head.
Smell....Smell of melon and over ripe fruit with pineapple also on the nose. light smell of citrus dank. Candied pine
Taste...Melon sweet hop some burn, yum, A fullness of taste that has a piney resin with bitter sweet after. A complex and rich poignancy that lawson""s brings with the yeast.
Feel... Suck a thick fullness with the carbonation making it not appear sweet in the back. Excellent.
Overall...This is very good just not the sort i seek out, so my bias is somewhat inherent in the review I suppose. Clearly that bias reflects somewhat in the score but ""Whata You gonna do"". I don't gamble on triple IPAs too much but this was worth it, and the caliber of brewery truly pulled my hand towards the purchase."
Triple Sunshine,4.46,"Slightly opaque with some particulate matter in suspension. Inviting aroma of tangerine and honey malt. Rich flavors of tangerine, floral notes, and ripe stone fruit. Even mouthfeel, a tingly finish. Alcohol is well hidden, just a bit of warmth in the cheeks in the finish. Good beer."
Triple Sunshine,4.01,"pours a lightly hazy golden with white head. That familiar Sunshine nose of Mango, Peach, some papaya as well. Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish. I think beer of this alcoholic magnitude should show the booze (so people aren't pretending how alcoholic this is), this does, but it does detract from the overall experience."
Triple Sunshine,4.44,"Pours a semi clear orange yellow color with a thick one finger white colored head leaving a nice amount of lacing down the glass. Smells of sweet toasted malts, citrus and floral hop aromas. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy and floral hop flavors and a bit of a boozy kick at the end. Heavier feeling than it looks but smooth and balanced, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall excellent beer!"
Triple Sunshine,4.05,"From a 12 oz. can dated 12/01/2021. Sampled Dec 30, 2021.

A more traditional looking golden appearance rather than hazy under a modest, fading white head.

Bold aromas of tropical fruits, citrus, dank, and resinous characters along with toasted bread crust and a hint of booze.

Medium mouthfeel.

Sweet and then those hop characters really jump forward and overtake everything. There is a slight booze burn at the finish and the booze seems a little more notable in the taste. Lingering finish."
Triple Sunshine,4.31,"12oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/2/21, so just over 3 weeks old.

Faintly hazy deep amber body. The loose bubbly head does not retain at all, hence no lacing.

Strong tropical fruit aroma.

On tasting, bam!! Big grapefruit, pineapple and other mixed fruit flavors. Solid malt base adds a sweetness. Warming from the abv.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a sweet warm citrus bitterness, grapefruit leading the way.

Overall, while all the parts may not be stellar, the overall effect is very good indeed. It is also dangerously drinkable, so sipper beware."
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.64,Enjoyed this in Brussels. Love raspberry and the Lambic balance was excellent. The beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared. Love this as a desert .
Lou Pepe - Framboise,3.5,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp."
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.75,"2015 vintage. Tart raspberries with typical funk. Had the 2012 Kriek and the 2013 side by side. The kriek was a touch superior, followed closely by the framboise."
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.68,"Today our fence is being repaired after a Tornado ripped through the neighborhood almost three weeks ago, so I am celebrating by drinking Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise (2015). It was among the best Lambics that I've ever had.

Look: dark red with an inch thick off-white head

Aroma: raspberry, white wine.

Taste: The flavor is tart raspberry, lots of raspberry, lemon, oak, white wine, and there's a very long and pleasant tart and dry raspberry after taste.

Body/Overall: medium body"
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.5,"750ml bottle at share. Ruby colored pour, head is a light pink. Raspberrries. Period. Huge berry aroma and taste, normal lambic funk. Slight barrel eleemnts. Great stuff."
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.13,"Beautiful red slightly pinkish color with a thin head.
Sour aroma with notes of raspberries, horse mantle, lemon drops and nice funkiness.
Flavor with notes of lemon sourness, raspberries, white wine, mild sulfur, lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with practically no residual sugar.
Light body with mild carbonation. It is not flat as in Lambic.
This is how a Fruit Lambic should be. No sugar residues with the raspberries fruitiness that is an extension of the natural Lambic flavors."
Lou Pepe - Framboise,4.44,"Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.

Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.56,"16 oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a nice head. Nice peanut butter backbone running through this, to compliment the overrriding chocolate flavor. Reminds me of an imperfect peanut better cup. Very enjoyable stout."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.59,"6 months old. Can to tumbler.

Look: Pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. A lot of very fine floaters visible.

Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.

Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.

Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.

Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.34,"Viscous and oily looking with light brown foam that settles into a thick ring with a few patches of lacing. Chocolate malts, lactose, Cocoa, and a bit of dry roasted peanuts. I’m not a huge fan of lactose in general, but here it does ok. Well carbonated and creamy. Overall really tasty, but not mind blowing in any way. I would definitely buy it regularly if it was available in my area."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.67,"16 oz can poured into a tulip pint glass. Pours pitch black with a surprisingly large mocha head. Good retention. Aroma and flavor feature dark chocolate, creamy peanut butter, dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, vanilla, and some earthy hop presence. This has to be the perfect peanut butter cup beer: not too sweet, real peanut butter flavor, not too strong abv-wise. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and not boozy. Overall it's a shockingly good beer and a real treat to drink."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.34,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months.

Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.

Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.

Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.

Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.

Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.52,"16 ounce can in a tulip stout glass. Exactly 30 days since canned.

Opaque black crude oil color with a near 3f dark tan cap. A ring remains and leaves splashes of lacing. A beauty.

Smoky roasted malt aroma with peanut butter, chocolate, and fresh roasted coffee.

It tastes like a peanut butter, chocolate, and roasted coffee mix over a campfire. Nice.

Palate friendly full body and flavors. No sign of its 7.6% abv. Very rich and roasted.

Before opening, I let this sit for an hour after removing from the fridge. The temperature enhanced its aroma and feel. Rich and creamy peanuts and chocolate. Not built for every day drinking but so good."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.83,"Excellent, but Treehouse does offer some slightly better stouts lMO."
Hold On To Sunshine,3.92,"A very rich beer. Pours black as motor oil, about the same consistency as well. A finger of dark brown head reducing to a ring of bubbles, leaving no lacing. Nose is peanut butter, chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses. Taste follows suit with peanut butter upfront and the rest taking a back seat. Very decadent beer but not overwhelming. Feel is full, creamy, and thick. I liked it and would drink more."
Hold On To Sunshine,4.38,Can courtesy of yllib.
Hold On To Sunshine,4.79,"Sweet and smooth. Dark pour. Loads of fresh-roast coffee on the nose. Dark chocolate on the tongue. An amazing beer!

Can / Nonic pint glass / No food pairing"
Hold On To Sunshine,4.5,"Pours very dark, pretty viscous, decent mocha head that slowly fades. Huge peanut butter aroma mixes with minimal chocolate. Very nice peanut flavor, light chocolate, espresso rounds off the finish with a light bitterness. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very tasty imperial pastry stout, love the low 7.6 ABV.

5/9/21
16 oz can dated 3/19/21
4.5 rating"
Hold On To Sunshine,4.83,Pours a deep onyx. Nice peanut butter aroma. Taste of perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. One doesn’t overpower the other. Smooth palate coating mouthfeel. Definite winner from Treehouse. The 7.6% abv a bonus.
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.82,"This beer is way more balanced than your typical IPA. The first note was more malt than hops, which was interesting. Bread and toasted malt. Then the hops. Floral, slightly earthy, a bitnof pine. Balance is the big word here. Super drinkable. A go-to beer for sure."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4,A lighter IPA that I think works well as a tasty refresher.
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.87,"12/11/14:
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.

Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.

Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.

A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.

Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

What's the paper on the bottle say? ""Rebel IPA is brewed with 5 varieties of West Coast hops: Cascade, Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook & Amarillo, It's everything we love about West Coast-style IPAs, Big citrus & grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful, refreshing brew."""
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.83,"Pours golden yellow with A 3/4 inch white head. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is grassy, piney, fruity, cedar.

Tastes of pine, grapefruit, earth, resinous.

Medium bodied, light carbonation. Semi-dry finish.

Lower carbonation than I expect from an IPA. Bottled 12/19. May be past its prime. still a good beer."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4.3,"Wow!
Starting with the look is good with abit of flatness. Smells great! Hoppy and truly aromatic like an IPA should be. Taste is amazing with abit of bitterness kick towards the end. Too say its fruity, it is definitely not, sweetness is very well balanced with bitterness. It will definitely play tricks on your taste buds. Definitely worth a try"
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.5,"Picked-up a six pack of bottles at Long Ridge Wine & Spirits for about ten dollars. Have had many brew from these guys before. This is decent, very malty. More of an English IPA."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.24,"This beer pours a very pale golden color with a bitchin foamy white head. The smell isn't overly hoppy, but they are there. Small hint of pine notes with maybe a little flower to it. The taste is very clean & this beer goes down easy, decent amount of hoppy bite to it. I would consider it a session IPA. It's more flat than it is carbonated, very light on the palate. This isn't a world class IPA, nor should it be, I think this is a very approachable IPA & one that could definitely be crushed while grillin or chillin. Anyone looking to get into the world of IPA's could start with this brew!"
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.83,"16oz can, pint glass, best by June 2020.

Crystal clear goldenrod with a whopper of a head! Two plus fingers of cratering new parchment foam rise and linger, dissipating slowly, becoming more craggy as time advances.

Clean, biting grapefruit rind, a trace of pineapple, some caramel peeking through as this nears it's drink by date, and Cascade floral-ness.

I get a dose of biscuity caramel that's quickly doused by a hit of grapefruit and bitterness. Pine and mango develop and pass into a medium bitter finish that's mostly clean, but sports a little soapy pith. It's really quite a hoppy one.

Medium bodied, though with more viscosity than normal for the style. The carbonation is medium-high and stands up to it.

I come away almost embarrassed that I've always discounted this beer, so much so that I hadn't tried it until this monstrous deal of a case of 16oz cans for $12 landed in my lap. I have my vacation pool beer now. I appreciate Sam's homage to the classic American, almost West Coast, IPA. Even when almost six months old the hops are very present."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,3.63,"Found this one locally at Lucky's Supermarket as they are now having their going out of business sale. Not bad, not great but very drinkable. I wish I could have found this earlier."
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4.35,Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. It poured a honey color with a 3/4” head and had a subtle hoppy aroma. Taste was very good with typical bitter-hoppy we expect from a mass marketed beer. This beer is very drinkable and would purchase again.
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,4.27,"(12 oz bottle, enjoy by DEC 2019; purchased single off shelf... poured into Spiegelau IPA glass)

L: brilliantly-clear, medium-amber colored liquid... fortunate pour brings tight, crystalline, rocky foam from midway up the bowl of the glass to the lip... chunky, messy head holds like a champ till the bottom; several thick streaks of lace

S: potent hop aromas immediately upon crown removal; in glass: pineapple, grapefruit, maybe a touch of mango... moderately bold, lasting intensity

T: toasty crystal malt and bready pale base jumps out immediately in its foundation, relatively dry, while peppery, spicy-citrusy hops cut over the top... aftertaste has a bit of pine and herbal-grassy bitterness, moderate peppery spice humming along... crystal malt builds in aftertaste as it goes, but the hop static continues to weigh it down

F: clean-cut, dry; delicate residual resinous and boozy streaks left across palate, slow flame builds a little warmth

O: never tried this; have only found old, out-of-code bottles in my hunt for it as of late (discontinued?), so surprised to find one in-code and with some life left in it... it's a classic WC IPA, as billed, with a relatively crackin' execution, if not particularly distinctive in taste... would very much enjoy having one again if it was my best option (1570)"
Apex,3.37,"August 16th, 2016 - Bear Republic's Apex predator is a trip to Glacier National Park in the glass. It panders to the bear theme, but also offers some good citrus pine notes, plus the decidedly NOT Park-like pineapple note. I also get tastes of raw tomato and watermelon. The flavor is milder and tickler than the aroma implies, with a stickiness, some dank touches, ginger and orange candies. It's a little too sweet for me, but not far from where I'd like it to be."
Apex,3.53,"From a 22 oz. bottle with no date or code.
L. Dark-orange and hazy with a mammoth off-white head which reduces to a bubbly cap in minutes.
S. Oranges and pineapple, honey and bread, apricot, nectarine, a bit dank, not bitter.
T. It tastes like it's past it's prime, but it ain't bad. Caramel, honey, woody bitterness, some grapefruit, over-ripeness.
F. Full body, a bit less than average carbonation, somewhat resinous finish.
O. The hop forward flavors and bitterness are barely a shadow of what they probably once were. Still an ok beer. Cheers!"
Apex,4.42,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip

A: Pours a golden amber color, slightly hazy, white head that was full, nice retention, and lots of lacing with a nice streams of bubbles, nice looking beer.

A: Lots of fruity, tropical aromas, oranges, tangerines, citrus peel, nice balance of caramel, toffee, sweet malts, no alcohol on the nose.

T: First impression is balance, not overly hoppy or malty, subtle tropical notes like guava, pineapple, and peach skin along with light sweet citrus notes, bitterness is moderate with orange and tangerine peel-like flavors, finish is malty, caramel and toffee, lingering notes of citrus peel and slight pine, very tasty.

M: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation leaving a prickly feeling on the palate, very dry finish, citrus peel-like finish.

O: A great balanced IIPA, just the right amount of hops, bitterness, and malts, drinkable that makes it easy to have two or three without leaving that raked palate feeling. I'll look to this each year."
Apex,4.32,"a) Pours a hazy amber with a dense head with lots of lace and retention.

s) Brassy tropical fruit tones with ample citrus and creamy caramel. But too faint.

t) super complex, drinks bigger than 8+%, malt creamy caramel base layered with multiple fruit.

f) Tangy full body with moderate carbonation, and a creamy, saucy mouth feel. ABV in evidence in a good way.

o) fruity complexity, apex of their fine IPA craft indeed."
Apex,3.2,"12oz bottle into snifter

Looks great, amber-orange with some good retention and lacing. Smell is malt and dry leaves. Getting the dry leaves in the flavor, too. Chewy malt, drying booze, grass, flowers and leaves.

Not a huge fan of the hop flavor in this one, maybe I'm spoiled"
Apex,4.15,"Had it on cask at George Keely, NYC.
Pours a dark amber color with a moderate head. It recedes into a silky film that retains well throughout.
In the nose there is a malty sweetness characterized by toffee and caramel. This is balanced by light tropical fruit and herbal hops.
In the mouth the first thing that stands out is the low carbonation due to it being cask conditioned. It is on the high side of medium bodied with a mouthfeel that is both soft and chewing; it makes for easy drinking. Malt forward flavors, especially caramel and toffee, as well as a hint of brown sugar that adds to the sweetness. A balanced combination of citrus and tropical fruit adds some zest. There is also a touch of soft alcohol. However, despite the sweetness, there is a bold herbal, grassy and pine hops taste that develops in the middle palate and adds a nice stinging spice to the mouth.
This DIPA hit all the right notes. I enjoyed it a lot. A fine brew by the consistently solid Bear Republic Brewery."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.59,"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.72,"This is my review of the 2021 edition of Utopias. I regret missing missing the previous editions, this is my first. With much anticipation I waited for my local Total Wine to show it in stock & rushed over to hesitantly with $240. I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish. There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price? Probably not. Will I try another in future? Probably, at least one more. Besides, it matches my furniture."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.54,"Is this a beer? Convince me! I bit the bullet when my local brew shop procured a trio of these for customers with more cash than sense. I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.

Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.

I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.

It's probably not fair for me to call it ""overrated,"" and given the expense of brewing it, I can't quite say it's overpriced. But the experience was more costly than it was worth for me."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.1,2021 with cherries. Total meh.
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.43,"2021 vintage, much more complex than my previous vintages, this ""beer"" only gets better with every year"
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.94,"2017 bottle. So interesting. So challenging. So complex. So tasty. Might not be for everyone, but it is for me. Think BA barley wine on steroids."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.82,"Just has the 2021 Utopias at the Sam Adams Cincinnati taproom.
I am not sure is this should be called a beer. Drinks like a port wine or Sherry.
Bold notes of dark fruit and hints of licorice.
It was a nice experience but a am not sure of buying a full bottle of it.
Maybe when I win the lottery I put one of these babies on my shelf."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.15,"L:. Pours a a brilliant chestnut brown with no carbonation and no head, looks more like a hard alcohol than a beer.

S:. Leads off with a sweet nose of molasses and maple syrup, quite reminiscent of whiskey, with a note of vanilla and cinnamon, some notes dark fruits and a light cherry, does remind me of a barley wine. Booze is noticeable.

T:. The strong booze coats the tongue first, followed by mounds of sweet maple and molasses, becomes quite reminiscent of whiskey, some notes of vanilla and a light cinnamon, don't get a tone of the cherry but a very slight note of them. Once again the booze is noticeable and drinks a lot more like hard liquor than beer.

F:. No carbonation, creamy smooth, strong heat from the alcohol

O:. This is a very interesting beer and very good, but too me it doesn't quite live up to the price or the hype."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.37,"2019 vintage

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up

Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs

It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey

This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa

A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet

This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!"
Samuel Adams Utopias,3.91,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have."
Samuel Adams Utopias,4.97,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021.

This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV.
The nose is out of this world. In a way, to me, it smells like a fine bourbon. Very boozy, first off. I get tons of caramel, toffee, chocolate, raisin, plum, and so much more that I can't fully describe. This is an outstanding aroma.
Taste - I know I won't do justice to this - Chocolate is up front, as is the raisin and plum. It then goes to the back to toffee and caramel. I'm also getting vanilla in the mix. This is really only a small portion of the flavors I'm getting overall, but I just can't put words to them.
Body - Up front there's a bit of a burn from the alcohol, but WAY less than the ABV would suggest. It then turns to a smooth, almost creamy feeling, that is so smooth and easy drinking.
This is worth the hype, and I'm so happy I got the chance to get a bottle. Being in the liquor business now, I'm going to try to get another the next time it comes out, just to see the difference between vintages."
Maudite,3.69,"Pours an opaque deep tan, soft 1.5"" head that thing out to a solid quarter inch, a bit on the light side; nice, streaking lacing. Nose is brown sugar, clove, allspice, banana, and some earthy hop notes as well; light roast as well as it warms. Taste leads candy, sugary sweet with only light baking spice notes to rein things in. Sweetness dissipates quickly, however, as warming notes from the alcohol become more prominent. As the beer warms, light spice and banana come through, but the dominant flavor is brown sugar, and the beer is lacking in depth. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth with mild but bright carbonation."
Maudite,4.23,"12 oz bottle, born on 5/14/21, poured into a pilsner glass at 45 degrees F:
L - copper tan with a soft off white head visible carbonation
S - clove, banana, coriander, roasted malt
T - Belgian yeast flavors of coriander, banana, clove dominate
F - lots of carbonation with a light crisp mouthfeel
O - nice, I think I liked the draft better. Perhaps this is past its prime although the bottle says drinkable to 5/2023"
Maudite,4.5,"I don’t know who or what Maudite is, but it doesn’t matter. Maybe it’s a renaissance era damsel in distress, and she’s up chilling in the dungeon asking for a ride home. Then up swoops dashing and handsome Raul, who tosses her a rope to climb down on. Yes. Maudite is her. Something so beautiful and balanced that I would risk execution to save.

Giddy up."
Maudite,4.23,"pours a hazy toffee brown body with a tanned cream froth head that has moderately high retention and leaves sheets of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a murky, full cap with thick defined halo

aroma is sweet caramel and spiced yeasty bready malt; banana, clove, and raisins are also lightly present

taste follows the nose and kicks it up to 11.

mouthfeel is medium carbonation and medium bodied. it runs smooth with a bit of grainy, prickly, chewiness

overall:
super solid brew with a slightly nuanced complexity. to boot, it comes with a certain legacy that ought to be honored, one that shines through with the overall enjoyability of this slightly high abv malt bomb"
Maudite,4.21,"#2 dubbed as ranked on beer advocate

Bottle poured into a large nonic

Brewers Notes: Without a doubt Unibroue’s best-known beer, La Maudite is inspired by abbey beers and Belgian double-style ales. It first hit the shelves in 1992 and took the province by storm with its 8% alcohol content, making it the first strong beer available in grocery stores.

That’s where the idea came to tie its name and branding to a pact signed with the devil. The illustration of the “chasse-galerie” (or flying canoe) from a belove

Translucent copper liquid crowned by a pencil thin taupe layer , recedes to a thin layer

Aroma is if caramel, malts

Taste is slightly sweet , caramel ,malts

Fizzy , sudsy mouthfeel

Good beer"
Maudite,4.02,"A near opaque matte, dull rust/copper body with an aggressive but not violent red clay tinged head. Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors."
Maudite,4.09,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH Goblet Glass

The beer pours a murky copper color with about three fingers worth of foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving some light lacing behind

The aroma is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread, raisins, plums, banana, and caramel. There is also a spicy aroma that compliments the sweetness

Like the nose, the flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread and dark fruits. Lightly spicy with some caramel and toffee that rounds it out. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a smooth finish

Overall, Maudite is a nice beer with a lot going for it. Very nice"
Maudite,4.06,"This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review.

It pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.

The smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.

The taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.

Mildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.

Overall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant."
Maudite,4.24,"Pours a cloudy, deep ochre colour in a tall goblet. Generous 4-5 inch head slowly condenses into a thick two inch head supported by the carbonation over the next 15 minutes.

Smells are lovely and complex. Overall spicy smells up front followed by gentle malts. Lots of bread, spices, peppery stuff here.

What a lovely taste. There are three parts on most of my sips. The up front — strong and peppery, coriander and Black pepper. Followed by the middle, which comes quickly after the spicy sip — malts and hop character swirl around, sweet bread and yeast followed by some grassy, clove-like bitterness. It ultimately finishes with the strong malt, yeast backbone, and the coriander and orange citrus notes can absolutely be noticed here.

As the beer warmed and I continued to sip I noticed a tiny bit of candied plum flavours in the finish, which again, was strongly malt forward and relatively sweet.

Beer is medium-ish bodied, smooth, nice carbonation, the alcohol doesn’t present a strong bite here anywhere. Finishes sweet but mostly dry.

This is overall quite a gorgeous beer. The one time I’m happy to be in Canada when it comes to beer is being so close to Unibroue. We can’t import international beers, and our offerings are tightly controlled by the government liquor boards, but we always always always can get the first pickings of Unibroue’s beers. Their winter collection is awesome. Maudite is an excellent beer and it has been 10 years ago when I first tried it, and is excellent to this very day."
Maudite,4.27,"Cloudy deep amber, nice off-white head, good retention and lace

Maudite,4.3,"Appearance: Opaque copper body under a large off white head that left moderate lacing.
Aroma: Ripe fruit swirling around yeasty, spicy, malty goodness.
Taste: Dried fruit, spices, some sweetness but not at all cloying. Hops not a major factor.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with lush carbonation leading to a lingering finish.
Overall: Enjoying the complex. multi faceted dimensions of this style."
Maudite,4.43,"Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.
Poured from a 12 fluid ounce bottle into a pint glass.
Looks deep Amber with a very nice tight foamy head that lasted.
Smells bready, spicy, coriander, yeast.
Taste follows the nose nicely, complex melding of flavors make this really nice.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall one of the better Dubbles that I have ever had and I would definitely order again.
Cheers!"
Maudite,4.25,"A classic. From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This excellent dubbel pours
a amber tinged brown with a nice head of white foam that settles to a
thick ring, thin dusty layer, and shows off some nice light lacing. Nose of
clove, coriander, dark candy sugar touches, dates, figs, and spicy yeast
notes. Flavors follow nicely with dark bread, spicy yeast, herbal balanced
hops, dates, fig, candy sugar, and coriander. Nice mouth feel;
medium body, light soft carbonation, and a balanced sweet and lightly
spicy finish.

Of note, with warmth some white pepper comes into play.

Overall, a classic that is just as good as when I had it
in the 90's!

Cheers"
Maudite,4.25,"Smells fruity and dark with malts sweetening the scent further.

The taste is balanced. It's mostly clean malts with funky Belgian yeast in the background.

The mouthfeel is fantastic. It's medium bodied with a lot of bubbly carbonation to feel like silk. The finish starts bitter and then gets fruity.

It's a really phenomenal double. One of the best Belgians I've had. I give it a 5.1 out of 6."
Maudite,4.07,"Pours a hazy dark brown color with a beige head which is short-lived and turns to lacing and a few floating islands. Spice on the nose especially some cloves, cinnamon. Taste’s great with spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg with some sweetness of caramel. The brew is perfectly balanced."
Maudite,4.2,"L: dark amber brown. Two finger pillowy head that sticks around for awhile. Nice lacing.

S: sweet malt, caramel. Maybe some figs. Faint fruit.

T: Sweet malt again at first. Brown sugar, caramel. Clove and spices as well on the middle to back-end. Dark fruit, prune. Some bread. A little hops and sweetness at the finish. Pretty dynamic.

M: Medium-full bodied, towards the higher end of medium bodied. Very nice carbonation.

O: Balanced with a lot of notes. One of the best for doubles."
Maudite,4.23,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. I picked this up at a local beer store recently to keep checking off Beers of Fame!
The beer pours a fairly clear amber to mahogany color with a fluffy beige colored head of about 3 cm. This foam fades slowly leaving some sticky lattice on my glass.
The aroma has some light caramel malt and a bit of cloves and light cinnamon. No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style.
The first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer.
Flavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow.
This is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness."
Maudite,4.55,Another home run. It’s amazing how balanced and well crafted this beer is. It’s even better than actual Belgian dubbels I’ve had. Just please don’t tell the monks
Taddy Porter,4.24,"12oz bottle coded SC10V1 (March 10, 2022) poured into a nonic pint glass at just above fridge temp, no ABV listed on label. The beer pours dark brown with little light penetration and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin cap and wide, continuous band of lacing. The aroma is mild & earthy, with tangy dark chocolate. The taste is semisweet, tangy chocolate with an earthy, mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, very good for the style."
Taddy Porter,3.48,"It’s okay. A little sweet for me, and I can’t stop tasting rust. Seems to leave the scent of blood on my lips. Probably won’t have it again, but a pretty easy drinking beer."
Taddy Porter,4.25,"Poured from an undated 550mL bottle.

On the pour a very impressive 4 finger khaki fine head with a very slow dissipation formed. After a very slow pour I got the whole bottle in my spieglau stout glass and eventually the head was just a ring around the glass. The body is not quite black but is a very dark brown with limited light coming through. Some very vague lacing.

Aroma has some relatively dry English ale notes backed up strongly by a chocolatey sweet roasted flavor. Not a lot of hops. The yeast is very traditionally sam Smith with sweet esters that work very well with the super chocolatey malts.

Taste follows the aroma but the malts carry a lot of depth that mixes very well with the light stone fruit esters of this yeast. The flavor is all definitely malt yeast and super light earthy british hops that carry almost no bitterness. Taste is super sweet and drinkable not to the point of milk chocolate but like a nice nutty dark chocolate toffee. Super tasty.

Feel is both rich and very drinkable at the same time. It isn't too heavy but feels sort of like a dessert. A very drinkable dessert at that. Mouth coating malts but at the very end the mouth feel dries out a bit to keep it from getting overwhelming. A very soft and nice beer.

Overall this is like a liquid dessert more literally than a lot of imperial pastry stouts. Very sweet and nicely malty while being very inviting and super pleasurable and easy to put down. Not sugary and flavored and super fun what they did with malt hops and yeast."
Taddy Porter,4.86,"I tried many, many porters amongst the many categories and nothing seemed to fit what I was looking for. Then I tried Taddy Porter and it just clicked.

Very smooth, well balanced flavors of chocolate and light coffee. The flavor is relatively light for a porter but that allows me to enjoy the characteristics of the beer versus the large smack of flavor that most porters bring. If I feel like dessert then I usually go with this one."
Taddy Porter,4.13,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a large, foamy, and sticky tan head that lingers. SRM of 23-24. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of chocolate and that strong roasted black malt upfront. Then some roasted oats and barley. More black malt. Slight leathery licorice and molassess. Dry and roasty. (4.25)

Flavor: Moderate to strong smokey flavors upfront. There's hints of chocolate, cocoa, before a smokey and roasted black malt and barley note. Finishes with more treacle, roasted black malt, and smoke. Malty, but light enough to be dry. Slight astringent smokey note lingers. (4.00)

Feel: Lighter-bodied. Low carbonation. Finish is creamy, soft, and slightly smokey. (4.00)

Overall: A really nice English porter here. Pours beautifully. Complex flavors for such a drinkable and lighter-bodied beer. It has a distinct smokey and roasted black malt note for the English style. Some complexity of licorice and leather. What really makes this beer is the softness and drinkability. Extremely drinkable and right-on for the style. A cigar would go well with with this smokey English Porter. (Rating: 4.13)"
Taddy Porter,3.88,"L: Poured from an undated 12 oz bottle into a Guinness pint. Very dark brown with a one finger tan head.

S: Sweet malt, molasses, cocoa. Very sweet smelling. A little too sweet for me.

T: Rich, toasted malts with a bit of hop presence. Very glad the taste doesn’t follow the nose as this is very balanced between sweet and bitter.

F: Light bodied, lively carbonation, dry finish

O: Another good one from Samuel Smith. Everything from this brewery is top notch!"
Taddy Porter,4.56,"Molasses, dark chocolate hops, burnt toast and that gunpowder smell of a kid’s cap gun.
Finishes with a slight twang."
Taddy Porter,3.71,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany amber with no head and no lace. The scent had subtle sweet malt. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and very subtle dark fruit presence . The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer."
Taddy Porter,4.76,"Appearance: A very dark brown almost black color with some ruby peaking through towards the bottom. A small cap of light tan colored head. Nice retention.

Smell: Iron, rusty nails, bread dough, dark fruits, light roast.

Taste: Dark fruits up front like the aroma, dark bread body, very nice balance between sweetness and bitterness. Roasted malt towards the finish with notes of cocoa and coffee on the finish.

Feel: Medium bodied, somewhat creamy with a refreshing bite from the carbonation.

Overall: In a world full of beers that appear to have the whole kitchen sink and then some thrown into the mash I'm thankful I can still find a select few that are still brewed with only malt, yeast, hops and water. This is a proper beer."
Taddy Porter,4.77,"Poured into a tall pilsner glass. Solid two finger brown head. Rich sweet malt notes on the nose, nearly completely black in the glass with ruby red highlights when held up to the light.

Surprisingly dry on the palate, mostly malt, brown bread, medium weight, good carbonation. Finishes dry, with just a hint of Hop bitterness. Really good, absolute epitome of a good Porter. The whole Samuel Smith lineup is top rank, and this is almost the perfect definition of a Porter. ABV is 5, so if you feel like crushing a second one there's nothing stopping you... Leaves excellent lacing all the way through the glass. I had not had one of these in quite a few years, and was pleasantly surprised that it was actually better than I remembered.

I have been revisiting some old favorites here in the past few weeks and boy howdy, this may be the ideal Porter, I've got to pick up a sixer of Anchor Porter next as that was the beer that was my gateway drug to porters many years ago. I'll do a back-to-back comparo and let you know.

Update January 30th 2022: Kind of a funny story... Friend showed up unexpectedly today...had not seen this gentleman in quite some time, he was passing by after a morning of black powder shooting... ""Hey would you like a beer, I got some good Porter in the fridge""... He said ""oh you know, I used to love Taddy Porter, I don't even know if they make that stuff anymore, I haven't had it in 20 years""... Well today's your lucky day my friend... We sat out under a crystal clear blue sunny sky here in Florida, unusually cool at 58°... And we enjoyed some Taddy Porter... Always tastes better with some convo and a good friend."
Taddy Porter,4.25,A Cold front in the lower midwest has set in. So I jogged to nearest dispensary to get a fine porter. Though I can drink this almost year round. This bottle from the 4 pack was a bit off. Overseas shipping? But was worth the trip into town on this cloudy cold reminiscent english winter day! Cheers
Taddy Porter,4.83,"This is in the running for the best porter I've ever tasted. The only other one I liked as well was at a nano-brewery, and that was one of their many, usually good to great, experiments. As what nI consider a major benefit, it has an abv of 5%, so you don't have to stop at one bottle as with a really hi-test beer. Good porters and stouts are much under-rated, and the trend towards very high alcohol variations is not helping. The aroma is pleasing and it has a nice look and feel, but its real killer is its taste."
Taddy Porter,4.5,"The taste is malty, nutty with dark roasted coffee & chocolate notes. It’s smooth with a medium/full body. Clean finish and tasty. Another well done brew from Samuel Smith."

Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.18,I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.

O - good, settles down nicely a bit after being decanted, the bourbon fades a bit and coffee and molasses flavors become more prominent"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.3,"2021-12-17
12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. No date that I can see. Received in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14 from @Whyteboar.

Pours black, opaque, thick-looking but not syrupy, with a fairly small but fairly persistent head. Smell is extremely rich, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dates, tons of anise.

Taste is super chocolatey, lots of vanilla, anise is more on the back end, hoppy/roasty bitterness coming a bit after that. Building up, giving me burnt toffee character.

Mouthfeel is medium to thick, bit of a chalky texture. This is a very good beer."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.9,"#86, yum, yum"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Plead the 5th barrel aged variant is a fantastic stout from Michigan. It is well rounded, comes in 12 oz cans, and heavy on the bourbon. Super sticky and a lot of fruit notes. Impressive from Dark Horse."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.75,It’s really difficult to get better than this when it comes to Russian imperial stouts. You can see why this is listed as such a respected brew. One I would get again for sure.
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,"2015 edition. Poured from a wax-topped 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Inky black pour with a finger of mocha colored head. Solid lacing.

S: Rich and roasty... big time cocoa , coffee, and grains plus bourbon/booze.

T.F: Just like it smells. Loads or roasted malts and burned sugars. Vanilla/bourbon... dark chocolate, espresso, and chicory. Toffee and molasses with a bit of oak and earth. Dark fruit and a hint of licorice. Medium to thick bodied... warming... boozy but not as much as expected. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

O: An elite BBA RIS. Fantastic flavor... and a great sipper. One to seek out."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.68,Quite a good Bourbon barrel aged beer if anything I guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has. Plus I think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is I picked up a couple cans for under $4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment. Sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout.
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.44,"2015 Vintage, 12oz waxed bottle

L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black.
S - Very sweet aroma of chocolate, molasses, and possibly root beer?
T - Not at all like it smells, and I can’t quite put my finger on the flavors. Mild carbonation, and I like it better as it warms. Not at all sweet, maybe even a bit bitter. Root beer? Char? Can’t quite tell, but unlike any barrel aged stout I’ve had.
F - Smooth, creamy, moderate thickness
O - Enjoyed this one because it’s different than any stout I’ve ever had. Def not your typical dessert stout"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.81,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth.

This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it."
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,"2013 vintage
12 oz wax-tipped bottle, into a snifter.

Crude-oil brew, viscous as hell. No apparent carbonation, no head. Nose is anise-forward, with notes of molasses and oak at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are full of licorice and root beer. Molasses, tobacco, hints of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected given the lack of carbonation. Medium finish (for the style), sweet with lingering residuals.

Wonder is the ‘top secret root’ is sarsaparilla?"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.59,"From the 12 oz can (!?!) in a snifter. This solid imperial pours a rich
coal black with a very nice head of light brown foam that dissipates
to a thick ring, thin swirling pool, and shows some nice lacing. Nose of
bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark coffee, dark chocolate, balanced char and
roast, and loads of warming, astringent booze. Flavors exceed by a nice
presentation of brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, rich oak, warming booze,
dark chocolate, faint tobacco, dark fruit notes of black and blueberry,
and a nice dash of cream. Nice mouth feel; full body, rich, smooth,
lightly creamy, coating, light carbonation, and a warming boozy finish
with a bitter malt end note.

A wondrous symphony of malt and barrel in perfect harmony!

Cheers"
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.6,"This 2021 release tastes a bit young when compared with prior years. Some 'heat' from the alcohol is evident in the first sips, and the overall taste is not as rich as I remember in prior years. Maybe this one needs some aging to reach its potential., but it's a very good beer now."
Temptation,4.04,"Poured from 12.68 ounce bottle into a tulip glass.

Look- Pale gold, very hazy, no visible particulate, sudsy white head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- White grape, oak, chardonnay, mildly brett.

Taste- White grape, chardonnay, sour finish.

Feel- Thin body, clean finish, very dry finish, sourness induces saliva, gentle carbonation.

Overall- A wild ale with an abundance of chardonnay characteristics. This is a large descent from the beer styles I typically drink, but was an enjoyable new experience."
Temptation,4.2,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 1-14-21; consumed 4-7-22.

Beer poured deep golden with a pretty good white head.

Nose is very nice, a nice combination of horse blanket, white wine, and a touch of sourness.

Taste follows the nose with a light but fairly substantial malt base that initially comes across as a sweet tart but has some funky leather. Finishes very dry and oaky.

Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with each sip.

Overall a sour that is very well done and does not obliterate my sour sensitive palate!"
Temptation,4.15,"Pretty color with a nice head on an aggressive pour. Smells fruity, tastes sour and dry. Comfortable feeling in the mouth but a little after bite"
Temptation,4.32,On tap at Iron Abby in Horsham PA. Pours a hazy gold with thin white head. Smells of grapes and oak. Nice tart flavor and finishes with a little tartness on the tongue. A very nice sipping beer.
Temptation,4.28,"Bottled 1/14/21

Oh man, it’s about damn time I get to try some of the Russian River Wilds! I managed to wrangle up 4 different ones, and plan to try them in order of lowest to highest ranking, starting here just short of the top 250 at #310. I’m too excited so let’s just get into it

Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper

The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather

A light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes quite dry and funky

This one is very good, but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit. Still, it’s masterfully done, and I can’t wait to try the rest"
Temptation,4.27,"Had a 2014 on tap in 2022
Look - Clear golden color with a nice white head and slight lacing. Shocked it looks this good
Smell - grainy tart citrus. Guessing the aging brought it to this smell but still fantastic
Taste - floral tart with a slight citrus
Feel - medium body with a crisp carb
Overall - really great beer. Would love to try fresh and see the difference"
Temptation,4.76,"Had this right after PtY, been wanting to try this almost as long as Pliny. Certainly one of the top sours I haven’t been able to try. Fathom Bistro & Bar on Shelter Island, San Diego. So much funk and delicious barrel character. The definition of a sour blonde. Wayyyy to easy to drink. Wow!"
Temptation,4.46,"Golden color, nicely hazy, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is green grape, lemon, oak, and da funky Brett.

The taste is very refined, with the green grape and funky Brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate, with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious.

The mouthfeel is bright and fizzy, per the style. An excellent wild ale, IMHO."
Temptation,4.62,"Bottled 3-27-2020. Poured in Tulip.
Excellent chardonnay aroma with slight earthy notes. Chardonnay is the main note in the taste followed by some apple and pear. Very dry and bitter. Tasty."
Temptation,4.88,"Definitely taste the chardonnay, good stuff!"
Temptation,4.38,"Bottled 6 months ago.

Pours semi-hazy sunshine orange with a persistent off-white head.

The nose is lemon, peach, pineapple, oak, and light cheesy funk.

The taste follows. Lemon, pineapple, orange, and oak. Low to medium tartness.

The mouthfeel opens medium and finishes dry. A touch too dry in my opinion.

Overall, very good. Delicate and complex. My one knock is that it leans bitter and dry on the finish, which undercuts the fresh fruit notes that are so prominent on the nose."
Temptation,4.67,Bottled 01/14/2021. Enjoyed on 05/28/2021.
Temptation,4.82,"*Aroma: Oaky, white wine, Chardonnay
*Looks: Pale amber, lemony hazy, 1.5 finger head that sticks around
*Taste: AMAZING! What a superbly made beer! Notes of Chardonnay, but slight sour ale notes with perfect dryness, this is a truly well made, work of art! I am speechless.
*Finish: Balanced, delicious, champagne-like but sour ale! Better than most Belgian Sour Ales. And that’s saying a lot.
*Overall Verdict*: A+++ all the way. Russian River has made an instant winner with this beer at 7.5% abv, super smooth, amazing balance, amazing sour notes balanced by carbonation. Perfect style for whatever the style it represents!"
Temptation,4.94,"RR beers are incredibly difficult to find on the East Coast, especially in PA, where (according to one source) they are randomly distributed. Was very excited to discover a few dusty bottles dated 050118 at Waywood Beverage in Kennett Square, PA. Opened on 1-10-20 and poured into a champagne flute.

A: Clear straw gold. Rocky white head that settles quickly. Some lacing remains after letting the beer open up for a minute.

S: Strong lactic sourness. Vinous white wine notes followed by golden raisin. Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose.

T: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay.

M: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation).

O: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body. This is an elegant and quaffable beer, with just enough funk and acidity to be rustic and refreshing and not toilet stall and corrosive."
Temptation,4.71,Funky with a nice tartness to balance it out. Great Chardonnay barrel as well. Very solid beer!
Temptation,4.4,Great wood notes that blends well with the chardonnay and ale. Quite sour but not over the top. Low carbonation.
Foggier Window,4.27,"Canned on 7/19/22; consumed on 8/17/22

Pours a turbid, milky honey-gold body topped with three fingers of fluffy, whote foam; good head retention yields ¾ of a finger of creamy cap, a thin, frothy collar, and slight, webby layers of taut, soapy lacing lining the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings fresh orange zest contrasting a musty lime undertone, with prickly resins and underripe mango building to candied grapefruit as peach fades atop a boggy subtext.

Taste offers ripe, waxy white grape sporting a tinge of honey upfront as notes of papaya and musty agave graze the mid-palate; subtle moss enlivened by orange zest on the back end culminates with fleshy peach trending into jackfruit density on the closing impressions.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation dispersing a taut prickle into an otherwise creamy mid-palate, where resinous grit lingers to a silky back end and balanced finish sporting a subdued bitterness.

Hearty resins amplify fresh, dank overtones to a waxy, tropical potpourri; an exceedingly stimulating profile balanced with silky, bittering edges."
Foggier Window,4.56,"I had an 8 oz draft at High Side.
L - Pours a hazy orange color with fluffy white head that dissipates relatively quickly leaving some lacing on the glass.
S - Smells of tropical fruit.
T - Taste matches the smell, getting tons of pineapple and stone fruit.
F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Really great IPA. I hope we see more Monkish in VA."
Foggier Window,4.18,"Pours a milky, orange hue with a turbid clarity and a creamy, 1/8th inch head the quickly disperses towards the shoulders, leaving small, oily dollops across the surface. Nose expresses hints of pith, citrus and melon. Taste follows nose, with a pleasant, herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation. Overall, a solid example of the style."
Foggier Window,4,"16 oz can at share, courtesy of Ken.Pale, hazy pour with small airy head. Aroma and taste feature lemon and lemon peel notes, not overwhelming, but just right. Mostly citric, but smooth."
DBR,2.94,It was infected.
DBR,4.42,"22oz bottle, taken from notes of Aug 2017

Pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge. Smells of oaky bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee and light coconut. Tastes of bold roasted notes up front give chocolate and char, followed by a compliment of barrel juice, oak, vanilla and caramel. The coconut develops near the finish, as well as more roast and barrel character. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming finish"
DBR,4.31,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 22 oz bottle from the purchase at the brewery on 12/1/17 (Greatest Hits batch). Reviewed on 1/1/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Very dark brown to black, and opaque. A minimum of visible carbonation, and only a tan ring of foam. The foam stays around, but no real head formation.

S: Bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Waffle cones and tobacco. Dark roasted malts with a modest roasty bitterness. Mild oak tannins. Quite a nice aroma, especially for non-adjunct stout.

T: Bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Sticky dark roasted malts, milder coffee, Oak, tannins, more vanilla. Some drying tobacco within the tannins as well. Then more sweet bourbon and chocolate in the hang.

M: A nice heavy, thick and sticky body. Carbonation is low but fine for style. The alcohol flavors are very, very well-hidden for the monster ABV listed. Good barrel balance as well – obvious bourbon flavors but still lets the other flavors come out.

O: So…this is an excellent beer. Big sweet dark malty beer with good barrel presence and thick mouthfeel. BUT…I just had the Calusa Barrel-Aged Sworn to the Dark – and I think I might prefer the Calusa. It’s not a huge gap, and it’s rather like picking between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, since I really liked both of them. Would drink this one again in a heartbeat."
DBR,4.41,"Great Hits DBR bottle. Strong, rich chocolate. As has been my experience with many Cycle beers, the barrel is very mild and subdued - there's a light woody presence to the beer, but the alcohol is very well blended. It's soft and quite drinkable, even given the ABV. I really liked this one - wish I hadn't shared mine!"
Pumking,4.64,"Slightly hazy, translucent amber color with a creamy white head. Good retention and a little lacing.

Smells like a pumpkin pie scented candle. Sweet, buttery, biscuity, heavy vanilla notes, cinnamon and other spices.

The taste follows the nose. Sweet, heavy on vanilla cream and toasted bread/pie crust; cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice, and ginger tie it all together, and the spices balance out the rich vanilla and pie crust brown sugar sweetness.

The mouthfee is slick but not syrupy, medium-plus bodied, well carbonated, shockingly drinkable for its abv and sweetness.

I've never been a big fan of pumpkin ales, but this is still the best I've ever tried. Bravo. Liquid pumpkin pie."
Pumking,4.28,"The bottle is a bit boring.
The smell is explicitly pumpkin. Which is a good thing because that’s why I bought it.
The taste is also very pumpkin, but there’s a smooth butteriness in the aftertaste which is super nice.
The feel is also buttery smooth."
Pumking,4.05,"12oz bottle Best By 05/23/24 poured into a small mug at fridge temp 8.6% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright light amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin cap. The aroma is sweet pumpkin and pie spice. The taste is semisweet pumpkin pie filling. No bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good pumpkin beer, if you're into that type of thing which I'm not..."
Pumking,4.12,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Best by Jun 14, 24. So REALLY in date.

L---Crystal clear, light orangey amber color. Fluffy white head faded quickly to a ring and left very nice lacing.

S---Strong pumpkin pie spices. Nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon.

T---Pumpkin pie spices as in the nose, but also noteable pumpkin. This is what I want.

F---Medium/full bodied. Mild carbonation.

O---An excellent pumpkin beer."
Pumking,3.26,"Tasted artificial I didn't enjoy the after taste.
Normally I love a pumpkin beer but this one did not hit the right spice notes for me. probably would not buy again"
Pumking,4.68,"One of the beers I look forward to the most during this season. The look of the beer is what you would typically expect from the style. The nose on this beer is one of the best in pumpkin beer. It's vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie and an earthy maltiness. The flavors just explode as you drink it. The higher abv really helps bring out these flavors. If you haven't had this one, get it. You won't regret it."
Pumking,4,"This is reaching close to the max of what a pumpkin beer can achieve. The pumpkin taste is deep and natural. The mulling spices are quite nice. So if what you want is a pumpkin beer, then have a Pumking. It doesn’t surprise me at all that this is the most rated pumpkin beer on the site. If you don’t want a pumpkin beer why are you drinking it and giving this a low rating? For the style it’s great."
Pumking,3.91,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium orange color with a mild creamy white head. A strongly bubbling body. SRM of 11. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate and rich bready aromas upfront. There's bread, some smooth orange, and more bread malt. Some sweet potato and pumpkin with a slight pumpkin spice like a pumpkin candle on the finish.

Flavor: Strong bready flavors upfront. There's a pumpkin and sweet orange flavor in the middle, that turns into the pumpkin spice flavor. Finishes with a fall/autumn spice, and slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is smooth, bready, and a small bitter bite on the finish.

Overall: A pretty good and very drinkable pumpkin beer. I haven't had too many pumpkin spiced or pumpkin flavored beers, but this one was the best I've had. Sort of feels like an imperial hefeweizen, but instead of banana bread is flavored with pumpkin. The breadiness is there. There's canned pumpkin and orange. Also some pumpkin and fall spice. Well rounded and drinks well. (Final Rating: 3.91)"
Pumking,3.84,"TW////: I drank this in Mona from Genshin Impact cosplay

Look: Nice amber yellow with an orangey tint! Like if you ate a lot of carrots and then you peed! Foamy head dissipates fast but a thin layer remains.

Smell: Like fucking pumpkin pie bitch. Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and everything like a pumpkin spice candle, some apple pie smell, some how it smells like toasted crust too! really amazing.

Taste: It tastes like pumpkin pie spit in beer and yeah kinda disappointing. Good malty beer with some cinnamon and clove flavor, and maybe nutmeg?? very little alcohol taste. The smell was amazing and complex, and the beer itself, at least to me, doesn't really have much ""pumpkin"" flavor. I wouldn't be able to tell you it was pumpkin beer if I didn't know beforehand. Its not BAD, its just not pumpkin enough.

Feel: smooth, carbonated little bubbles, doesnt leave your mouth or throat dry.

Overall: This experience is not unlike being invited to a costume party and you work hard on a costume to wear to it, and turns out, you're the only one wearing a costume. Excited to go leading up to drinking it, but once I took a sip, was left kinda disappointed and ashamed. I STREAMED THIS! HOW DARE YOU EMBARASS ME INFRONT OF MY VIEWERS! I'LL GET MY REVENGE YOU BREWERS!!!!"
Pumking,5,"I will admit I was skeptical at first about a pumpkin flavored beer but I am glad I gave this one a chance. If you like pumpkin this one is a must try. Smooth, refreshing, full of pumpkin flavor and a sweet finish. Highly recommend this beer!"
Pumking,3.65,"Look: Slightly hazy yellow. One finger of thick white head with good retention.

Smell: Mild pumpkin, rye bread, a little citrus.

Taste: Sweet pumpkin pie, mildly spiced. Little to no hop flavor or bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, with good carbonation.

Overall: Nice, if unspectacular."
Pumking,3.81,"First time trying this.

L: 3.75. Nice dark golden body. Lingering head. Moderate carbonation.
S: 4. Caramel. Pie crust. Spices. Pumpkin.
T: 3.75. Getting more of the pie crust than the spices and pumpkin. Still delicious.
F: 3.75. Slow goer due to the ABV. Thin to medium mouthfeel.
O: 3.75. This is a tasty ale, but for a flavored beer like this I don't think you need the high ABV. Might save one to enjoy on Halloween, but otherwise probably won't buy again."
Pumking,3.75,"On tap.
Amber yellow. Great retention and lacing.
Smells is odd and almost off putting. Like wet cardboard.
Taste is on point though. Great pumpkin sweetness.
Full bodied. Low carbonation. Sweet aftertaste.
I couldn't drink a four pack of this. But am really glad I got to try this."
Pumking,4.63,"L- Nice, honey warm yellow. With almost no head.
S- Beautiful smell. Very warm and Halloween filled. Nice notes of clove, pumpkin spice, and oats.
T- Nice strong hit of Pumpkin Spice. Very inviting taste that is as smooth and warm as it smells.
M- Super smooth and easy like sunday mornnnnnnnnnning :)
O- Looks can be deceiving. While at first I saw a very simple and basic ale. I was instantly intoxicated by the aroma and the taste of this Fall classic. I see why this beer is ranked #7 of the best pumpkin beers out there."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Roasty, boozy, malty. Warming up helps it round out into a pretty good beer. When it’s cold, it’s a bit thin and the flavors don’t come through. Feel is a bit thick and syrupy, but I enjoy it, I heard the latest version wasn’t very good compared to the past, but I like this. And then I see I actually rated it lower than it’s score, and I guess what I’ve heard is right."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.45,"Delicious 2022 bottle. Pours deep black/brown with no head. Aroma is mild rickhouse (woody, bourbon) and roasted malts. Taste follows with nice mild bourbon notes and solid roasted malts. Feel is stellar smooth, roasty, clean, wow. Overall, if you have the means, you should experience this."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.99,"12oz bottle of the 2022 vintage. Has a strong barrel character of bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Moderately boozy with plenty of alcohol heat. Coffee is a bit hidden but noticeable. Mild bitter roast in an otherwise sweet stout. Too sweet and too hot for my tastes but I do enjoy the barrel flavors."

Taste follows. rich dark chocolate, fudge, bourbon, oak, oaky/bourbony vanilla, coffee, excellent. A bit of warming alcohol."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.36,"12oz bottle. Label identifies this as '2022' product.
Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing.
Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon.
Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste.
Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation.
This is a great sipping brew, similar to a slow sipping whiskey. Savor each sip to get the full expression."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Alesmith has one of the longest chain of variants in their Speedway Stout. You got the base, Barrel Aged, and everything in between. Here we have the 2022 BA variant; no frills and full of tangy yeast. The barrel plays lead actor and gets straight to the point. A great offering for the BA purist."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.37,"Bought from bottle craft in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. $8.5 for a 12 oz bottle

A&S: Appearance looks pretty bland. No real head or lacing. The speaks of the head that are there, are brown. The aroma is pretty amazing. Powerful bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, toasted malts, and some coffee.

T&M: Taste is pretty tasty. Slightly bitter, sweet syrup, caramel tones in the finish. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to the taste in my opinion. I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy. Carbonation adds a tiny kick, but not enough to take away from the milky tones.

Overall: I liked this beer. It was worth a try, but it falls into the category of, worth a try, but won't buy again."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.99,"This stout is hardcore. It tastes like something a witch would brew in a cauldron, or like drinking from a swamp of chocolate and bourbon. It's very reminiscent of Hoppin Frog stout variants. Rich, decadent and potent

Absolutely delicious. Goes down like motor oil. Rich like nothing else, but if you like it - you'll really like it. Also, I'm drunk!"
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.25,"Released 4/23/22; drank 6/15/22 @ the Yarchives.

Black/brown appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice dark tan head; nice lace.

Dark roast coffee bean, bourbon heat, milk chocolate & faint wood notes in the nose.

Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Dark roast coffee bean & bourbon heat flavors up front; milk chocolate & faint oak notes on the finish.

Not too sweet, but perhaps a touch too boozy. A solid barrel aged stout."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.28,"So this is a George Burns beer - we are talking 100 here and stuff. Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that. Let’s boogie."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"12 ounce bottle, 2022 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some oak, dark bready and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty good straight up barrel aged version of a classic imperial stout, really liked this one a lot! Speedway Stout is a great brew to begin with, and AleSmith didn't mess up the barrel aged version! Wish I would have bought more of this one, I know I'll buy more of it if I get the chance to!"
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.9,"Bottled 418/22, poured at 52°. Really nice looking pour, thick'n chewy almost black, a small tan head that's gone in a flash, some lingering bubbles at the edge. Snot maker detects some coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, maybe a bit of vanilla and bit of whiskey. Taste buds get, chocolate, coffee and toffee. Nice creamy mouthfell, a very easy drinker, abv is hardly noticeable."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,"Just got some bottles in via delivery, was itching to try... and i'm not at all disappointed.

This is the 2022 edition, 13.3% ABV... pours an opaque deep dark brown with quickly receding bubbles, reminded me so much of a cola... The nose is of deep sweet malts and barrel wood, coffee, cocoa, chicory... Taste delivers the promise on home, with those sweet malts and barrel leaching, tangy vanillin, brick choco, cooled coffee... not so ""hot"" in alcohol burn... Nice, comforting and appealing feel in the mouth, on the tongue and in the swallow, deep but not overly sticky. Very enjoyable and i'm sure i will be developing a real craving for the remainder of this stash.

EDIT: I'd pit this against the venerable Parabola any day."

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,3.17,"2022 version.
I came in with low expectations compared to their 2020 Anvil and Stave BBA Speedway series. Reasons being : this was available for shipping ( 2020 was pickup only) , this saw very Wide distribution(2020 didn't) , this one cost 8 dollars for a 12oz ( 2020 was 15 for 11.2 oz), abv is 13% which is 1% over regular speedway (2020 was 14.4), They didn't disclose barrel source and not importal but the label sucks.

Smell: single source well made espresso shot with shaved dark chocolate on top, very little bourbon .

Look: looks like an Imperial Stout

Feel: coats the toungue nicely and almost a bit chewy but falls short cuz feels thinner than what i expected

Taste: heres the downfall of this . It tastes lime bottom shelf milk chocolate and hardly has any cocoa, vanilla,tobacco, leather or dark fruit flavors. It has a taste of cheap ass bourbon on the backend of this as well.

Overall: glad i only bought two . This one is a letdown, but i hold their 2020 to be the standard. Save yourself some money and just buy Regular Speedway. Its the same shit.

2020 Release: i rated All 5s.
Updated this for the 2022 release.
2022 doesnt compare at all. What a let down."
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.66,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a mocha colored head.

Smell - The beer had a pleasant bourbon nose. The malts of the beer were also allowed to shine.

Taste - The profile was led by loads of milk chocolate. Bourbon was strong, but not hot or overbearing. The malts were evident as were hints of vanilla. Bourbon became a bit stronger in the finish with just a bit of sting.

Mouthfeel - This was not a particularly thick stout, bit it coated nicely.

Overall - This is a tasty, fairly easily accessible BA stout."
Upper Case,4.72,Very smooth @ 9%.
Upper Case,4.56,"Exceptional hope load. Great lupulin bitterness, but balanced. The only way I can fault Upper Case is that it seems a tad watery and could be a little hazier -- related, I supppose."
Upper Case,4.46,"Canned on 8/7/20, consumed on 9/15/20.

A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a half-finger white head that settles fast.

S: Really nice nose - a strong nose that jumps out of the glass. Dank, green, raw hops and a lot of tropical fruit: mango, some pineapple, papaya.

T: Follows the nose, with mango, pineapple, citrus pith and peel, and a bite of leafy green hops. White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ). Alcohol is noted as heat on the back of the palate. Good balance, with a nice bite of bitterness at the end, which lingers.

M: Juicy in feel, call it medium in heft/weight. Somewhat juicy up front, but lightly dry and chalky into the aftertaste. A bit of booziness.

O: Very good. A little too much alcohol, but otherwise a very well done brew."
Upper Case,4.57,"Can dated August 4 - beer share at Canton St, thanks Zack!

Phenomenal. Tons of sweet mango but so perfectly balanced against a back drop of dank, chewy hops."

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.65,"2022

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down. The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase. But, these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers. If you are curious, I say try this once. This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,5,"2022 version. I really get the Heaven Hill and Woodford Reserves notes in spades. It’s more a “stouty” barleywine to me, think flavors of BCBS swirling with 50/50 2015 Woodford Reserve. Bright alcohol bite. Caramel notes in the middle of sips and swallows. Mouthfeel is full, just below syrupy."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.85,"Pours deep, dark brown. Aroma is amazingly sweet with caramel, brown sugar, spiciness & bourbon. Taste is incredible balance of the aroma with a perfect hint of vanilla. Full bodied.
Overall, the best barleywine I've drank."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,3.65,"Can 2020 vintage. Dark brown pour with no real head. Big boozy caramel bouquet. Thin in body. Super boozy with caramels, raisins, and oak. Good mouthfeel with a thin body."

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,5,"2020 waxed can: This was a straight up 5. It's everything you want in a BA barleywine. It's thick, chewy and absolutely punches you with toffee and barrel. This was shared with about 8 people and one can was enough. It's a sipper you want to take your time with for sure."
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,4.75,Cognac sweetness balanced with oak comes through on the nose so strong. Amazing. The balance of flavors combining the barrel and barleywine is incredible. The ABV is so well hidden. Incredible beer. Complex and powerful

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.31,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.42,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.

Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.

Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.

Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.9,"#96, yummy!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.08,"2018 Vintage

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75

Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25

Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0

Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25

Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,3.75,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.34,"Look - fantastic black and thick with a great lasting tan head and rimming
Smell - you can really smell it all. First notes of smell is the cinnamon and roasted malts with a slight chili pepper followed by cocoa and vanilla
Taste - cinnamon and pepper with a slight sweet vanilla and a little cocoa
Feel - medium body light carb with a slight cream
Overall - tasty Mexican stout"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.52,"Had this in August, then the 2016 version, + have tasted a few vintages before. Incredible solid imperial stout from the Floridian masters here! Super RIS"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.62,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.

2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.54,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.26,"To me this will always be the beer that started it all. Delicious, dark cherry and cinnamon taste. Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel. Tried it with some older folks who never had a craft beer before and they were sold!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,4.12,"L: Pours a brown-black with a perfect deep mahogany head which does not dissipate too quickly.

A: slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness

T: Fudgy up front followed by a perfect spicy chocolateness and really a great mole character which I what I think is their goal. Almost taste like a cinnamon graham cracker in the beginning.

M: Slightly thin for a beer of this stature, but the medium body is welcome with the spice complexity.

O: Finally glad I got to enjoy this one I’ve been seeking for years. It’s a well crafted beer and one of the best spiced beers I’ve had."
Devil Dancer,3.96,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point. Enjoyed this in the middle of the afternoon on a day with no commitments outside the home, and that's probably for the best! Thank you for getting this to me, Craig! It's one I've long been wanting to try!"
Devil Dancer,4,"Amber hues and sticky sweet. Booze and pine. Caramel malts. Noticeable lack of citrus on the nose and in the taste. Musty hops and dark fig fruit. Bubbly to the finish. Outrageous bitterness becomes more pronounced as it warms, rounding out the flavor profile and improving the taste. Overall quite nice. And at 12% ABV, it will do the trick."
Devil Dancer,4.05,"Appearance:
Pours the color dark wildflower honey, a deep amber with sunny hues of orange.

Bouquet:
Syrupy sweet hops, mango, citrus, and pleasing, earthy yeast after-notes.

Taste:
Ye gods, hops! A spectacular symphony of hops: musty herbals, bright florals, and sharp citruses. All riding in on a lush wave of lavish treats, like butterscotch, caramel, and raspberries. Finishes with a clean, powerful heat.

Feel:
Full-bodied. Satiny molasses with a bubbly bite. The treacle-like qualities don't overstay their welcome, but the bright, effervescence lingers like a miniature fireworks display, as its tickling bubbles burst brilliantly in all corners of the mouth. The contrast is delightful.

Reviewer's Notes:
Bottle aged for 3 years at 42 degrees Fahrenheit, no exposure to sunlight. Bottling Date: 05/10/2016"
Devil Dancer,4.22,"Boy this one’s good. Whew. Powerful and strong yet flavorful and clean. So-called “triple” IPA obtained fresh from Founders via growler. Purchased on 9/6/19. Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery."
Devil Dancer,3.92,"Look: Oooooh. Almost brown-orange. Easily the prettiest of the four IPAs I ordered as a flight at the Founders brewery. Persistent lacing and continuous bubbles.

Smell: It smells wet, the way that yeasty Belgians can, but in a way that I know it's not actually going to taste like that. It's weird; honestly it smells a little ""off"", but the taste is fine.

Taste: Astringently hoppy (which I like),

Feel: tingly, foamy. Thick and resinous but so effervescent, so quite a contradiction in mouthfeel

Overall: compared against Founder's 12 Feet Under, I'd say I prefer 12 Feet Under. Maybe it's just because I have a fond place in my heart for things like Dogfish 120, or because barrell-aing anything is a great way to my heart. This is fine, and very hop forward, but doesn't have the depth of 12 Feet Under. Dogfish 120...12 Feet Under...120 Feet Under? I smell a collaboration in the future. Get on it, Founders!"
Devil Dancer,4.84,"Bottle from the cellar. Bought in 2012. With a cabinet full of barley wines and belgian darks, this is a real standout. Low carb, low to no head. Deep copper/red color. Slight warmth. The aromas and taste of this one are why I put these beers away for years. Hats off, founders."
Devil Dancer,4.1,"Even at two years old, this packed a lot of good flavor."
Devil Dancer,3.75,"Bottled 5/24/15; drank 6/28/15 @ the Yarchives.

Semi-opaque ruby red appearance.

A rough pour produced a nice tan head; nice lace.

Grapefruit, mango, booze heat & faint caramel notes in the nose.

Thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Caramel, raspberry & strawberry flavors up front; a brutally bitter, dry alcohol heat finish.

Good flavors lurk beneath a punishing finish. Too bad."
Devil Dancer,4.34,"Smell of butterscotch. Taste starts as butterscotch and slowly fades to nearly the taste of the last sip of a sweet bourbon Manhattan. Aftertaste sticks around for minutes. Perfect mouthfeel. I really enjoy this beer, and you should too!"
Devil Dancer,4.38,Similar to 120 but smoother. Delicious
Devil Dancer,4.09,"Note: bottle date 5/4/15

This bottle was pushed to the back of the collection and just unearthed.
Pours a clear reddish amber with a billowy head that slowly fades. Lots of malt and caramel on the nose. Very flavorful, lots of caramel, malt, butterscotch, ends with a clean bitterness. Boozy, 12% abv is obvious. Thick and syrupy, carbonation is still great after 2.5 years!
Overall this is a great triple IPA, aged well imo.

I heard good things about this beer and paid a pretty price for it ($65, actually ordered it by mistake, but so it goes). Overall, this is a decent beer for the style but not something I think warrants the price paid for it.

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

This is great stuff, and a great kickoff to NYE. It's been a hell of a 2021, both on here and in my life and general. So, cheers BA, happy new year!"
Blanc De Blancs,4.3,"A 375ml bottle, blend #2, poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.

Taste: Sour, tart, vinous, white wine grapes, honey, oak, funk, with notes of sharp acidity but not overly so.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate to soft carbonation.

Overall: Solid beer with nice aromas and flavours with abv completely hidden."
Blanc De Blancs,4.49,"I received a bottle from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a Side Project Lambic glass also courtesy of @fbarber. It pours a cloudy, bright orange. It looks like Orangina. The head fizzled away almost immediately but that is typical for the style. The nose is just superb: like a fine Chardonnay; I'm smelling lemon, orange peel, and peach. It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it."
Blanc De Blancs,4.75,Poured from a 375 into an SP durobar glass. Color was vibrant yellow/orange with not much haze once dregs were poured. Aroma was unripened green grape peel and chardonnay. Taste followed with the addition of oak. Really well balanced too. Can’t believe this is 10%. Phenomenal brew. Would love another!

Pannepot,4.3,"July 30th, 2016 - A wonderful treat, here with a good friend, and an aged beer that might have soon been eligible for a museum. Complex, deep, and wonderful, it bears a striking relationship with its cousin tasted and enjoyed back in October. The smell reminds me of yakitori stands on a cold winter Tokyo night, and made deep with a muddy, rich aroma. The flavor is equally impressive, and develops as a well trained orchestra, with multitudinous tastes and notes acting in concert to a glorious crescendo."
Pannepot,3.6,"1300th review. Something £ and 'exotic' that rather missed it's high expectations.
L- Black to the eye, held to a halogen it's a super-dark red-brown. Pours with a 3mm fine-bubble pale tan head.
S- Quite bright and vinious... is this aged in wine barrels? ...
T- It definitely has a fruity/wine side to it... then I start wondering just wine, or wine plus a hint of brandy ie it's quite a pungent/'ABV%-ey' facet.
F- It doesn't taste like a typical Belgian Quad, the wine edge is prominent here. It's all in pretty pungent, one for slow sipping, esp in winter/colder months.
O- Well it's a tasty beer, but for me the wine notes are a bit too prominent. The adage from my youth was 'Enjoy the grape (wine/brandy) or the grain (beer/whisky etc), as never the two will meet'. I.e. mix them => hang-over from hell. And that seems to be true. So beer tasting of wine is a bit strange for me.
This beer is from a bottle labelled on the front 'Pannepot - Special - Reserva' in place of the '2006 - Ale brewed with spices' in the photo above.
Bottled: 24/04/2018. 330ml. Bought from Bacchanalia, Mill Road, Cambridge/UK £6.99 - Ouch!"
Pannepot,4.23,"2017 bottle

Pours dark brown, tan colored head that fades. Aroma of doughy bread, caramel, booze, clove, dried apricot. Similar flavors in the taste, starts a little sweet but finishes dry, a little oaky, and mild tartness. Medium bodied."
Pannepot,3.84,"A tad too sour to be balanced, although overall quite complex and nice. I sense apples and pears and a little berries and caramel. But that's about it"
Pannepot,4.08,"2016 vintage, bought at Bine and Vine, SD.
A good quad in its own right, with excellent smell and some depth in taste. However, there is some strange off-taste. Not an all-round quad like Roch 10 or Abt. 12"
Pannepot,3.7,"2016 vintage. Deep brown, dark amber when held against the light. The head is light tan, and dissipates quickly. Smells sweet and spicy, with a touch of booze. The taste is likewise very malty and rich and balanced with a subtle tartness, with a nice bitterness following it all.

I find at first the beer is almost medicinal and syrupy thick, but letting it sit allows it to 'calm down' a bit, thin up a little and let the tartness come through a bit more--obviously I like it when it's the latter. YMMV, but try that if you don't like it at first."
Pannepot,3.7,"Beatifull flavours. Full bodied. Raisins, a little sour? Still I think the older version are much better."
Pannepot,4.01,"2017 vintage

L -- Pours a very deep brownish amber body with a scant half finger of head produced with aerated pour. Minimal retention and a ring of lacing around the edge of the glass
S -- Raspberry, caramel, milk chocolate, prune, hint of funk. Quite complex yet mild
T -- Cacao powder, oaky tannins, wet leaves, dried tobacco, sherry, herbal hoppines, hint of dried dark fruit. Again, quite complex and hard to accurately describe. Less pronounced Belgian yeast character than many of the style
F -- Medium mouthfeel, medium carb. Surprisingly thin body for the ABV and style, but with a good depth of flavors and a nice drying finish
O -- A very unique ale that sits at the intersection of a Belgian dark ale, quad, lambic, and porter

Pannepot,2.14,"2018-04-27
11.2oz bottle served in a tulip. 2016 on the label. 2119150 12016 is stamped on the cap.

Pours a dark, dark amber or a reddish brown. Small head, slow fine carbonation. Poured the bottle completely and watched a slug of yeast/sediment slide out, but I'm ignoring that. Recommend leaving a bit in the bottle to avoid that. Smell is chocolatey, and herby/spicy -- kind of makes me think of mole. Definite date aroma.

Taste is vinegar and soy sauce. I'm not sure I can bring myself to put another sip in my mouth. I'm going to try. It wasn't worth it.

Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Overall...must be something wrong, but honest opinion of the beer in my glass is that it is bad."
Pannepot,4.3,"330ml bottle poured into a goblet. 2015 vintage, bottled Oct’15, consumed Feb’18.

It pours a deep brown liquid with thick tan silky head and semi-transparent texture that stands with pretty good retention. The head gradually dissipates to a thin lasting foamy film atop and leaves some lacing on the glass-side.

The smell consists of many layers of aroma. First, hit with dark chocolate, biscuit, and toasty breadiness. Then, sweet caramel, dark fruits in kind of prune, plum, and dark raisin as well as candy sugar, molasses, and spice.

The taste is led by big yeasty element of dark raisin, prune, and plum along with obvious spice like pepper and clove. It has big sweetness of candy sugar, molasses, and caramel but fortunately not overwhelming. Dark malt plays as a foundation with its bread and toasted biscuit. No chocolate can be found here through the palate sensation. There is some bitter kick too from its hop and toasted profile.

Medium body with low carbonation but consider proper to the style and palate, the feeling is well-rounded and just right with a pleasantly dry finish.

Very good dark ale indeed with the same Trappist’s quality, alcohol is perfectly concealed underneath the complexity of depth."
Pannepot,4.04,"Pannepot Vintage 2016, bottled on 7th June 2016. Opened 10th February 2018

Pours dark brown, almost black with no head. Smells is quite complex with spices, plums, forest fruits and hints of caramel. This beer shows of its character after it warms up a bit. When it started warming up it became really enjoyable. Light carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
Pannepot,3.72,"So this is the flagship of one of the best brewery around, capable of some masterpieces as cuvee delphine or rye quad.
I drunk Pannepot a couple of other times, but I can't remember clearly how it was so this time I will be more focused on this vintage 2015.
Nice look and a lot of beige foam.
But aroma and taste are funky, at least.
They say it has it all, toasty bitterness but even caramel sweetness.
For me it's messy.
Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a good brew, but a very strange one for the style.
Almost unpairable with bread and cheese, give its best drunk alone.
But t simply it's not my taste."
Pannepot,1.31,Surely the bottle was bad. Would try again to be sure.
Pannepot,4.62,"Poured into a Chimay chalice.

A: The body is pitch black. The head is minimal with a beige coloration. After the pour, there's literally no head at all nor lacing. It's a 10% ABV Quadrupel, so one cannot expect much, but still, some head would be great.
S: The aroma is incredibly complex: there's spices, there's fruits - blueberries, raspberries; there's even a hint of chocolate, more like milky chocolate than dark chocolate - actually, there's some sweetness that seems to come from lactose. Since the taste has some tartness, I can't help but to think there was some lactose and lactic yeast hanging around. In the end, a very high alcohol profile. You can't hide that.
T: The taste starts with a spicy touch of fruits, blueberries, raspberries with some cinnamon on top, having a weird feeling of spicy and fresh due to the fruity freshness. After the sweet tones, you're greeted with a somewhat prominent tart flavour, acidic to a very bland balsamic vinegar acidity. In the end, a roasty touch fills in the mouth finishing the ale and bringing with it the sensory feels of sweet and tart tones. Spices come around again, fruitness as well and that Martini Bianco-like acidity is brought back again like white wine grapes were also used here. Strange, complex, but good.
M: Body is medium. Carbonation is medium. Alcohol is noticed all over the beer. Bitterness is almost non-existent. Sweetness is low.
O: It's a very complex Quadrupel that I wasn't intending to find like this. Weirdly, that's what I have to tackle now. Besides having this giant complexity, I don't find this beer drinkable has it tries to make so much on one single sip. The flavours sometimes are not friendly as well. But it's a great brew and that's what I came here for."
Porter,4.19,"Totally opaque, color of black coffee, huge tan head dies fairly quickly, lots of sparkly lacing. Nose is quite muted, malt present. Flavor is great, relatively light with malty and chocolatey notes. Average feel and finish. Would drink occasionally."
Porter,4.43,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for ~20 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: Dark espresso, with brown highlights and a 3-finger, dense, tight, brown head. As it drinks, thick lacings trace the glass

Smell: Sweet malt, bready yeast, espresso, and coca predominate

Taste: Cold-brew espresso at the front, with nutty and chocolatey notes, giving way to an herbal, medicinal note in the middle, before finishing with a sweet, mocha taste. Lingering aftertaste reminiscent of that of a cup of hot cocoa.

Mouthfeel: Bready, thick, lightened by a significant amount of fine carbonation on the tongue, giving way to a syrupy thickness going down. Coats the mouth well, perpetuating that post-cocoa aftertaste, mentioned above

Overall: ""At least out loud I won't say I'm in love""

In all seriousness, though, this is a terrific beer. Perhaps a tad bit sweet at the end, but not cloyingly so, and balanced well by the rest of the flavor notes. Also, it's not so boozy I won't remember it, either"
Porter,4.09,For me this is the classic example of a standard American made porter.
Porter,4.43,"Founders Porter-dark, rich, and sexy! This 12oz. bottle was given an aggressive pour into a 20oz. weizen glass. Three fingers of creamy tan foam that lasts. As it slowly recedes there is some thick lacing left behind. This porter is very dark, there is no chance of observing carbonation.
The aroma is fantastic, sweet chocolate, caramel, malty, and a pinch of coffee!
The flavor is sweet but quickly gives way to the coffee flavors, with a dry, bitter finish.
The feel is medium, very smooth, maybe because of the light carbonation, with the dry finish I was talking about.
This looks great, smells wonderful, and each sip begs me to come back for more. Tonight this is a liquid dessert nightcap."
Porter,4.96,"If there is a better Porter I would like to have a pour. Like drinking a flour less chocolate caramel cake with an espresso dumped on top. Delicious aperitif. A world class beer, indeed."
Porter,4.24,"Poured pitch black with a mocha color 1 finger head that slowly dissipated and left no lacing. But just looking at it made me really want to drink it, looks wonderful.
The aroma was toasted coffee and baker’s cocoa with some caramel around the edges.
The taste followed- with the addition of what seemed to be hops. A distinct bitterness closed out the sips with an almost stout like malt flavor leading the charge.
The feel, well, made for sipping, it’s ideal for that!
I have had this on tap and should have rated it then, but better now (from 12 oz bottle) than never. It’s very good, but I think I prefer Baltic Porters."
Porter,4.08,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown in color, approaching black. small tan-colored head with moderate lacing retention.

Smell - dark chocolate with subtle malty notes, along with some light smokiness. contrary to the bottle and other reviews, I don't detect a lot of hops in the smell alone. the smell is well balanced and very pleasant.

Taste - light black malty bitterness hits the palate first, which builds. this is then complemented by hoppy bitterness that is very much apparent (unlike in the smell), which creates an interesting contrast. other characteristics from the smell, including the dark chocolate and smoky notes all displayed prominently in the taste profile. finish is long, with some lingering bitterness.

Feel - medium bodied, above average carbonation, and on the higher end in ABV for the style at 6.5%.

Overall - I think one of the reasons this beer gets such high marks is how clearly it fits the definition of a robust porter and how clearly it delineates from a stout (or a lighter porter). it does check off nearly every box for the style, and is an excellent textbook representation."
Porter,3.34,"Not very excited about this one. It began when I paid $15 for a six pack. It was labeled incorrectly on the shelf. There were ten people in line behind me and one clerk so, grumbling, I paid and left. Probably for the last time.
Refrigerated for 24 hours and then left to sit 30 minutes or so at room temperature. It’s 71 Fahrenheit today actually.
Poured into a wine stem. No surprises. Opaque, black beer with brownish foam.
First impression on the nose is pure hops. For me, never a good sign. Beneath that, some pretty standard chocolate and light coffee-caramel action. If you know the style, it’s textbook and uninspired.
Taste repeats the nose. Nothing special here at all, which they attempt to hide with the hops. Just lazy.
Finishes better than it begins but it’s a low bar. Pretty heavy and thick. I would have thought the ABV higher.
I have enjoyed a few Founders brews but this is not one. The high score is bewildering to me but, hey, enjoy it if you can. Cheers!"
Porter,4.34,"This is a beer I have enjoyed for many years and was surprised to realize I had yet to review it. While irrelevant to the review, I love the label art.

A big, two-inch head glistens with dark, chestnut hues. A pancake batter forms over the opaque blackness within a Harp nonic. The batter ever so slowly retreats, leaving dense patches of lace in its wake. The head never fully dissipates, rather, it forms a quarter inch of dense cream to be penetrated with each sip.

Dark roasted Bakers chocolate yields to rich, roasted coffee beans. Later, malted chocolate mixes with caramel and light hints of floral and mint notes from the hops.

The flavor follows the nose, while the roasted nuances are subdued. Bitterness edges out sweetness and both are well controlled. The hops are more like pine straw than the floral or mint observed in the aroma. This could be a savory dessert with its light umami dancing in the long, mild finish.

The light to medium body is low for the style. A smooth, fluffy texture envisions dense fur. Soft carbonation lifts the light dryness, while residual sugar builds on the lips.

This goes well with a cigar, however, it is so good on its own, that one should reserve most of it for the pure drinking experience. It elevates a ribeye. Today, I enjoyed it while reading as my wife played the harp, on a cold, wet, November, Sunday afternoon."
Porter,4.07,"Pours a deep, dark mocha-brown, giving it a brown-black hue rather than ruby. A thin, half finger tan head appears and quickly recedes.

Gorgeous aromas here, there are three stars: chocolate and rich cocoa, roasted and toasty caramel malts, and smoky coffee beans.

Taste follows the nose to a T. The chocolate is smoother here, more sweet with toffee and caramelized sugar notes than cocoa. The smoky notes are tones down, and the roasted malty, toasted bread flavours are a little more subtle. Some lighter coffee bean tastes, but it’s in the background and well integrated, which is nice and gives this a balanced flavour profile. No major appearance of hop flavours aside from a very light bitterness on the finish. The bitterness feels like it comes from the roasted malts rather than typical hoppy notes, which is enjoyable in a Porter/stout.

Semi-dry finish, with a medium body that leans to the lighter side. Lower carbonation, which results in a very smooth sip, the very very gentle bubbles roll over the tongue and lightly froth at the end creating a creamy sensation. Gentle finish, lightly bitter with nice malty and chocolate notes.

After a lot of (sadly local) poor stouts and porters, when I cracked this open and poured it and got a whiff of delicious aromas just from opening it, I got very excited! That being said, I will temper that a bit by saying I don’t think I can rate this as high as it is on BA. I definitely enjoy stouts and porters with huge, bold flavours. That said, Founders Porter doesn’t necessarily need to be powerful, holding its own by dialing up a few key flavours and melding then together in complex and subtle ways.

The line between porters and stouts is very blurry, and between a ‘robust’ porter and stout (or imperial stout), well, it gets quite confusing. Some would say (and they have!) that these porters are meant to be more subtle and complex than stouts. Since the line is so blurred I just try to take it on my personal tastes. Regardless of all of that, this is still an excellent beer. My next aim is to try this on tap (unlikely for now as I live in Canada) and trying to get a super fresh bottle. Mine was four months out of bottling so some of the flavours might have mellowed"
Porter,4.46,"Look: Dark black pour with very little foam risen to the surface.
Smell: Reminds me of a stout kind of chocolate with high malts. On the bottle it says there's a caramel smell to it - didn't catch that in my pour.
Taste: Immediate taste of malts, chocolate, slight caramel taste as well towards the end with a bitter finish. Well done! This is a really good porter - probably the best I've tried so far. (I've only tried 6 porters - more of a stout guy).
Feel: Medium to full bodied - light carbonation.
Overall: The reason I bought this beer was because I've heard about it before, and in some way it reminded me of a stout. This beer is a very good beer, definitely would buy again in the future."
Porter,3.97,"Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good-looking Porter.

Smell: Fairly moderate roasted malts and mild brown sugar notes.

Taste: The taste profile features subdued roasted malt note, some dark chocolate notes, and mild coffee notes, with some bitter hop notes at the end. The finish is fairly dry ending on the roast malt notes and bittering hop notes.

Mouth-feel: on the light side of medium bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good non bal-aged porter. The flavor profile nicely integrates all the different elements present."
Porter,2.22,"Bought a case of this about mid-2021, tasted like the label described, smooth, etc. Bought another case the other day, bottled December 2021, tastes like a campfire. Never liked that in a stout, let alone a Porter, and certainly wouldn't have repurchased if the previous batch tasted like it. Anyone want 23 bottles of burnt Porter?"
Porter,4.26,"This is a nice contrast to all the coffee-centric stout porters on the market. I want to think that this is a larger fermented porter based on it's character. Either way, larger or ale, the mouth feel is crispy, tingled froth. Nose is edge of smokey roasted, with a base of yeastyness. Appearance is strong, and fades to respectable porter carbonation. Flavor is burnt ends, charred wood, and hop balance. Dark chocolate akaline finish. Overall, a powerful player in the porter game to put balance in the force."
Porter,4.33,"Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.
Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass.
Looks dark brown almost black with a nice tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap.
Smells malty, sweet, chocolate and coffee.
Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of chocolate coffee and caramel.
Mouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish.
Overall a very nice example of a Porter that I would definitely order again.
Cheers!"
Porter,4.5,"Mmm, pours dark and lovely. Big chocolate notes. Subtle coffee, bit more bitter than I expected. What a lovely porter."

L: Deep dark brown (not quite black); coffee-colored. Light brown head that fades slowly.
S: Chocolate, just a little bit boozy. Caramel sweetness too.
T: Lots more chocolate, a little coffee flavor mixed in. A little bitterness but not as much as expected from other reviews.
F: Smooth but heavy enough for a porter.
O: A great example of the style, though not as on the mark as Edmund Fitzgerald."
Porter,4.78,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated 10-20-2021 into a 12oz Tulip glass

This is my first ever review. Here goes. Simply outstanding.

L: Black , opaque . Can’t see through the liquid black gold. Using a flashlight on my phone from the other side no light passes through. A nice fluffy tan , creamy-looking head that dissipates after a couple minutes into a nice thick ring that leaves silky lacing on the glass as it goes.

S: plenty of toasty coffee , and chocolate on the nose, some type of dark fruit maybe ? Malty. And caramel .

T: Non sweet chocolate and malt up front , and tons of toasted coffee and hops on the finish that blend perfectly . Not too bitter, but sweet actually. Roasted coffee beans linger on the finish, and the aftertaste. Simply fantastic.

F: Mildly carbonated , between medium to full-bodied on the mouthfeel. Mild carbonation on the finish that bodes well with the aftertaste . Not as silky as some stouts. Not as full bodied as some stouts. This is a porter. A fantastic example of a Porter.

Overall I give this beer a 4.75 , give or take. Fantastic example of the style . One of the , if not the absolute best Porter I’ve ever had ."
Porter,4.61,"This is a good Porter. In fact, though I don’t drink porter much, this is the top of the list. It is thick, flavorful, and smooth. It is nutty, chocolate, and coffee infused. Very tasteful and hardly any aftertaste. Thumbs up!"
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,3.23,"When I moved to Massachusetts from California two decades ago, I assumed I'd miss the hell out of Rogue Shakespeare Stout, which was easy to find in California.

I encountered Ipswich Oatmeal Stout, was surprised by its robustness, and concluded after several samples that it was a more-than-adequate substitute for the Rogue brew. The makers of Ipswich tweaked the brew occasionally over the years, always raising its richness. When I finally sampled it side-by-side with Shakespeare, I found that I preferred Ipswich. It had more of everything. I'd recommend (or rave about) this stout to others as one which had some of the richness of an imperial stout without an over-the-top ABV.

But they have changed it -- for the worse this time. It's still good, but it has been softened; it has been toned down.

Whereas the Ipswich Stout of the 2000s and 2010s had high carbonation for the style, it is now creamy, almost nitroish in texture. The earlier Ipswich Stout had a punch of Cascade hops in the palate; today's version has English hops. The earlier Ipswich Stout was powerfully rich (it was indeed reminiscent of espresso and bittersweet chocolate), today's beer has a gentle, sweet toffeeish flavor. The original Ipswich Stout was fearless and uncompromising; today's beer is soft and gentle, as if striving to occupy a middle ground between what it once was and today's hipster dessert stouts.

It's not bad. I'd never turn one down. However, today's brew is a shadow of its former mighty self."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4,"I am trying this beer off the tapper at the brewery as part of the ""Classic"" four sample flight. It poured a dark opaque with nice tan cascading head that left a spotty lace. The scent had subtle malt and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink. There was a subtle sweet roast and chocolate malt base with hints of coffee presence. The mouthfeel was smooth in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a great beer."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.25,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. I did not realize that I had not review this brew before. I have had this many times before, looking forward to trying again."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.18,"Pitch black appearance with a large, mocha colored head and lots of lacing; a real treat for the eyes. Charred malt aroma, with notes of coffee, smoke and bittersweet chocolate. Roasted malts rule the taste, but sufficient hops help maintain a good balance. Smooth, full bodied mouthfeel that is nicely carbonated. Dry, bitter, lingering finish. Very enjoyable."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.02,"Very fine beer.

Pours a very nice deep deep brown, almost black. Rich brown head.

No noticeable smell.

Very smooth taste - full bodied and slightly sweet."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.3,"Pours a black not real light getting though this baby not on a cloudy day anyway. Nice two finger dirt brown head that falls slow and laces well from an aggressive pour anyway.

Aroma is nice rich roasted malts a good dose of sweet chocolate that dominates with bitter coffee trying to sneak its head above with sweet oats and chocolate. Some light earthiness from the hops maybe and hints of smoke underneath the sweet roasted goodness.

Taste is good roasted malts not as sweet as the nose more subdued chocolate and coffee mixture in the flavor but pretty tasty. Some light smoke hints and a earthy/herbal hop bitterness to round it out and prevent any cloying. Nice smooth and favorable with a nice enough hop finish with a burst of carbonation to round it out.

Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonated at the same time maybe could use a touch less carbonation but that might be nit picking.

Overall nose is wonderful taste is better then good, surprised this little brewery has a good brew here this one would be in my regular rotation if it was available in my area. Nice little stout."

Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,3.73,"Very dark brown with tan head.

Has kind of a molasses and dried fruit smell.

Taste and mouthfeel are super smooth. Chocolate is the dominant flavor, but also getting some coffee.

Really nice oatmeal stout."
Ipswich Oatmeal Stout,4.35,"Fills a PBGC Dimpled ""Sparkles"" Mug with a very, very dark brown directly from the bottle. This is black and syrupy in the mug while a one inch, dense, creamy chestnut head eventually deposits patchy lace.

Bittersweet chocolate reaches out from the mug. Toasted malt, cashews and dark chocolate are more prevalent while sipping. All are slightly more pronounced in the finish.

Roasted malt bitterness joins with almost-burnt toast on entry. Bakers' Chocolate and nuts fill the middle while coffee joins in the finish. Mild, but lingering warmth, makes the chocolate sing and draws out more sweetness.

A creamy full body compliments the smooth texture of Jersey cotton. Mild alcohol, soft carbonation, and light astringency fill out the palate.

This Stout worked well ushering in the Spring. It would seamlessly add to any conversation, especially with a soft, nutty cheese. Thank you Louise and Rodney."

S - hits hard with lime and bread. Toasted orange peel and graham crackers. Pithy pineapple, vegetal qualities, and hop puree. Smells like choking down hops. That's a good thing. If hops were air, I could breathe this.

T - lively burst of grapefruit juice. Some serious depth of flavor, featuring papaya, guava, apricot, and bubblegum if ""hops"" were a flavor. Warming, doughy orange peel and loads of citrus pith. Oat bitterness. Full and suffocating in flav. Rindy OJ, complete with pulp. Pineapple freshness. Syrupy candy on the finish that quicky zips it up with some tingly bitterness and lingering dryness.

F - pillowy. Yes, generic description, but it's true. It's seriously full and satisfying. An elixir to behold.

O - just wow. Such flavor range. Like wringing out every last bitter drop of your favorite ball of citrus. If I lived in the middle ages, I might think this has healing properties.

Space Trace,4.07,"2018 bottle, drank March 2021 out of an oversized tulip.

Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.

Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.

Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.

Feel - moderately thick.

Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs."
Space Trace,4.56,"Og, 2016. Best batch and best coconut stout.

Coconut check . Barrel check. Smooth checkout!

Last batch had basically no coconut, very disappointed."
Space Trace,4.93,"I love coconut beers, and this is one of the best I have ever had. Again, this hits all the feels and then some."
CitraQuench'l,4.24,"Neon yellow hazy body with a white head and decent lacing. Big citra nose, pushes the citrus notes of lime and grapefruit far. Taste is much the same, decent bitters, but the middle is lighter in flavor, holding this back from meeting the hype. Feel is bright, light, refreshing with good hop cutting the body, lacks lush and full nature of the top hazy ipas but higher bitterness helps the finish. A good neipa, but no way is it the 46th best neipa in the world"

Can to snifter.

Citrus nose. Grapefruit. Tangerine. Melon. Black pepper.

Pine taste. Some tangerine in finish.


Interesting.

Changing flavors and palates as it goes. A touch more juicy as it warms; also the aroma picks up more of the pepper and pine throughout.

Poor mans Julius.

CitraQuench'l,4.48,"A beer that I’ve been looking forward to try and did not disappoint! Great, we’ll-rounded beer!"
CitraQuench'l,4.1,"Was really excited to try the allegedly best IPA from NC. Not a bad IPA at all, however it has a hefty price tag and I would rate this Resident Culture Pleasant Dank 8% above this Hiest beer. It just really didn't punch me in the mouth with flavor the way i thought it would."
CitraQuench'l,4.43,"Picked up a four-pack at TW-Greenville SC on 9-8-21 for $21.99. Canned 7-29-21; consumed can #1 10-12-21. Cold stored since purchase.

Beer poured a hazy golden orange with a very nice white head with the original pour.

Nose is very nice as the citrus and tropical fruits are front and center.

Taste is spot on as the moderate sized pale malt base takes on a solid dose of orange, lemon, and mango wonderfully. Finishes with a nice rind bitterness; 6/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light bodied and very refreshing.

Overall a very nice NEIPA, full of flavor and refreshing!"
CitraQuench'l,4.59,"Citraquench'l is a long-time whale. I bought two packs today in Durham, NC. canned on 7/1/2021. Poured into a pint glass. It pours an opaque, tangerine color with a half finger of foamy, milk-white head and thick, soapy lacing. Its smell features bright lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, and some delightful, floral notes. Wow, the taste is something else! The Citra offers huge, sweet citrus: lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, and ripe honeydew melon. It just pops. It's amazing that all this flavor comes from a single hop. The mouth feel is moderately creamy with near perfect carbonation, and at 7.1% ABV it's readily drinkable. Overall, Citraquench'l is everything it purports to be and more! It's absolutely delicious. One of the best New England IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink. Just terrific!"
CitraQuench'l,4.5,"Juicy, heavy, bold hazy citrusy/tropical IPA. Super enjoyable and bold."
CitraQuench'l,4.71,"1pint can dated 3/25/21

Golden murky yet luminous haze, no floaties, three fingers fine white head, full lacing curtains and cap.
Strong pineapple, orange, grapefruit, guava, yeast, seashore aromas.
Peach, grapefruit, tangerine, candied orange peel, light pale malt flavors.
Smooth full mouthfeel, light hop tingle mid swallow. Lasting carbonation. Nice bitter aftertaste and dryish finish.
Top tier NEIPA."

Head Hunter,4.56,"Tasted from a 16 oz can acquired in Ohio.

L - Light gold color with very slight haze and constant, mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer. Huge, pillowy, frothy, off-white head that lasts and lasts.

S - Big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange, but with another earthy note, similar to pineapple. There is a bit of bready malt in the finish, very restrained, like a saltine cracker.

T - Strong, citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately, with navel orange, grapefruit and pine. The hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. Exceptionally clean fermentation, with no yeast fruitiness noted.

F - Medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect, yet somehow the finish feels dry. Moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. Hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. Alcohol presence fairly high, which matches the listed ABV, but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.

O - This is a world-class American IPA, on the aggressive end of the style's spectrum. It slams your senses unapologetically, and I love it for that."
Head Hunter,4.96,"Head Hunter has a thick, ivory head and a bubbly, gold appearance, with moderate lacing. The aroma is of white bread crust. The flavor is of intensely-bitter hop resins and sweet, white bread crust. Head Hunter has a high-medium body and a drying finish.

Head Hunter,4.23,"Traded one of my fav hazys for this one….nice trade! An awesome and well crafted American IPA!! I will look for more… Taste has it all. Upfront malt and hops.

T: Caramel malts, light & firm pine resin, over ripe orange and lime zest, plentiful bitter hops that gush, enthusiastically rich & moderately sweet, a suggestion of bread crust, peach cobbler.
F: Crisp, rich, smooth, fairly assertive but soft & delicate, moderately juicy as well,. Medium bodied w/a lightly drying soft lingering finish.
O: Aggressive and poetic all in one. Profound and ardent levels of flavor. Very well balanced, hop forward and extremely easy drinking for it's higher ABV. Beautiful tasting with a brilliant feel. It is world-class in it's style and well deserving of that distinction."

Head Hunter,4.46,"CANNED ON 06/04/21 on bottom rim of can.

A: Light amber hue with 2-finger off-white frothy, rocky head with excellent retention and crusty thick lacing.

S: Absolutely delicious aroma of pineapple, guava, passion fruit, pine, and grapefruit with a hint of medium caramel

T: The dank, piney, resinous aspects of the flavor are much more prominent but blend well with the fruitier qualities of grapefruit, pineapple, and guava. The caramel character is a bit stronger than I like but it works fine with the resinous character. Bitterness is strong. Clean, minimal ester profile. Alcohol is evident on the aftertaste.

M: Medium-bodied, creamy feel with a very dry finish.

O: A well-crafted WCIPA -- less caramel malt character in the aroma and flavor and this is a top 5 overall for me."
Head Hunter,4.46,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a tulip glass.

Beautiful straw color with a finger and a half of white head.

Smell of pineapple and stone fruit.

Taste follows the nose, with a nice bitter bite on the end.

An almost perfect example of a West coast IPA.

I can not recommend enough!!!"
Head Hunter,4.83,"Pours a beautiful clear orange color with two fingers of sticky white head. Incredible lacing.
Aroma of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange peel and caramel.
Taste is very well balanced between malt and hops. Orange, grapefruit, mango. Caramel sweetness. Finishes piny and bitter. So many flavors working together.
This is a beautifully crafted beer that is one of my favorites."
Head Hunter,4.4,Golden straw yellow look. Leaves about one finger of white head and nice lacing as it goes down. Smell is resinous pine and tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose. Pine and citrus with a nice cracker like finish. Feel is medium body with medium carbonation. Overall this beer is world class. It’s reputation is well deserved
Head Hunter,4.34,"Poured into grip shaped goblet: color is gold, transparent, head is off white with fine bubbles, presenting 1 finger thick and then dissipating to thin top with some lacing.

Smell is big hop notes of pine, grapefruit pith, lighter tropical fruit, then toasted malt not overly sweet but present and backing the hops.

Taste is pine, grapefruit, mixed tropical fruit, toasted malt, pale malt, lighter notes of orange and caramel with some warmth.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, firm bitterness, slight drying.

Overall an excellent ipa with great malt/hop balance for an ipa and notable pleasant hop/malt flavors."
Head Hunter,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Appearance is a clear copper color, with more than a finger's worth of white head. Good retention and lacing.

Aroma: pineapple, mango, citrus and a hint of pine, caramel, orange, grapefruit, and honey.

Taste is hoppy, piney, and fruity. Really tasting the pine and grapefruit, and the sweetness is mainly from the oranges, mango, honey, and even tasting some tangerine. Body is medium and somewhat chunky."
Head Hunter,4.99,First ever can yesterday. The smell is amazing and intensifies when poured. The look is what you would expect with a lovely head. Taste is amazing all the way thru the glass and mouthfeel spot on. Overall OUTstanding ipa.
Head Hunter,4.27,"poured from a can dated 2/22

Appearance is crystal clear copper/amber thick fluffy head that reduces to a thin veil light lacing

You can smell the fruit aroma as it's poured, pineapple, mango, citrus and a hint of pine

Taste is full, hoppy and fruity as the nose, notes of pine and floral

mouthfeel is big, medium carbonation, it runs prickly to astringent to a dry finish that hangs on in your throat,

Overall this is a crisp clean refreshing beer, not a sipper"
Head Hunter,4.74,"GREAT beer. Copper/caramel color. Head is typical white, with great lacing. Nose is pungent with hops. Taste is delightful. Slight citrus with even more slight fruit flavor. Feel has a nice bitter bite and aftertaste that almost grips the backside of tongue."
Black Gold,4.53,"Not getting much bourbon, but the barrel wood is really coming through. At first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic, but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that.
Very easy to drink. Solid all around. Thirty minutes out, there’s more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe. The base stout is,
for lack of better description and palate, a savory type, not sweet or chocolatey. Buy it if you see it."
Black Gold,3.82,I don’t get any bourbon barrel character whatsoever. Extremely roasty character.
Black Gold,4.49,"Very excited about this one. Poured from fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with almost no head. It looks thick!

Nose: Beautiful. Roasted malts and dark fruit jump out immediately. The bourbon is definitely there, adding nice vanilla and caramel notes. Chocolate notes come through nicely. The nose is generally sweet, with no detectable bitterness. Molasses starts to get noticeable as it warms.

Taste: Wow. What a nice marriage of roasted malts and sweet bourbon notes. Dark chocolate, charred oak, toffee, vanilla, dark berries, raisins, dates, a touch of leather, earth, and brown sugar. This is just a fantastic barrel-aged stout. Each sip makes me want more.

Mouthfeel: Not the thickest stout in the world, but definitely creamy and silky. Just amazing. Overall, a huge winner in my books. I hope you track another down at some point."
Black Gold,4.25,"2020 vintage; consumed on 9/18/21

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.

Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.

Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display."
Black Gold,4.76,"11 August 2021 - Beer #247 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade
Current Rank: #98 on Beer Advocate

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 4 - I'm not getting much barrel here. Smells like a straight up imperial stout. Good thing I like those.

Taste: 5 - yeah, definitely more barrel here. This tastes like Bourbon County's little cousin who's a bit rough around the edges. Just a tad bitter.

Mouth: 5 - silky smooth. Slightly thick, but like velvet going down.

Overall: 5 - really world class. My only gripe is the slight bitterness

Cheers!"
Black Gold,4.11,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla.

This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.

This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.

There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be."
Black Gold,4.5,"Appearance - The beer poured a fuzzy black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence.

Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger.

Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely."
Black Gold,4.4,"Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.

And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.

Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness."
Black Gold,4.52,"Pours a deep black with more than head than expected, thicker than I remember last year Lots of nice barrel on both nose and taste. Very smooth and no heat. Love this one and will seek it out every year."
Dortmunder Gold,4.26,"It's malt/caramel heavier, that for sure. But it's a good one. Based on what the style is, I would say this beer is good at evoking the pilsner side of things. Very well done for such a widely distributed brew. A notch above the average highly distributed lager. Heavy yet quick finish, very unique and makes me want to seek out more from this style."
Dortmunder Gold,3.86,"Bbe 09/12/22 around 45-55 degrees F

L: copper body, white 2 inch head. Healthy lacing.

S: lighter malts, pepper and spice, a little hop

T: follows nose, good balance. A little heavy on the pepper imo.

F: too heavy for a light summer lager, more of an Oktoberfest beer.

O: my first beer of the dortmunder lager style, I probably should’ve drank it at room temperature. It went down a little too heavy for a lager when cold imo but It tastes like a quality brew."
Dortmunder Gold,3.1,"Found a nice assorted variety pack waiting for me in the fridge when I arrived at the camp this afternoon. We had the Great Lakes IPA a few years back and it was solid. Wondered into the craft lager space a bit this afternoon and while this isn’t a sandbox I love to play in, I took a swing. This is thick, heavy and an absolute loaf of bread in a glass. It has a nice taste, but it’s not something I want more than one of. It’s Boston Lager that’s too heavy and trying to do too much."
Dortmunder Gold,4.05,"Poured a clear orange/copper color with a pale orange head. The head was moderate immediately after the pour and dissipated slowly.

This beer has a fresh aroma. The most notable smells are malt and yeasty bread.

I really like the taste! It is predominately a strong spicy flavor, mainly cinnamon, and quite malty."
Dortmunder Gold,4.52,This lager when poured from Tap has a half inch foamy head. Clear amber color. A sweet hop aroma. A Carmel hop sweet flavor with a slight bitter hop tase over the pallet to counter the sweetness . Great Lakes has a strong winner with Dortmunder Gold Lager!!
Dortmunder Gold,4.05,"A - Pours out a clear orange. A white head, with a full persistent cap after the fade. Lots of fine line lacing on the glass as I drink.

S - Strong hit of sour grain, grassy hop notes, and a bit of minerality.

T - A lovely honey note over a soft, undefined apple or pear flavor, with steeped tea acidity and limestone as the sweetness washes away, then a bitter close that skirts the line between pith and aspirin, staying on the right side fortunately and finishing clean.

M - This beer is so drinkable, despite the fairly challenging flavor profile, because it lands light, closes dry, and leaves you looking for the next drink.

O - The style is not one I seek or particularly enjoy, but this beer illustrates why a good lager of this type can be an enjoyable experience that people want to consume while downing pretzels and sausages. Prost!"

Dortmunder Gold,4.04,"Grabbed a Great Lakes variety pack and this is the first one I tried.

It’s golden to amber in color with a limited amount of foam, moderate carbonation, and clear appearance.

The smell is not too strong for me but the malt does come through. There seems to be a hint of citrus as well.

It’s an enjoyable, easy drinking beer that packs a bit more punch than a traditional lager. It has a medium body with no hip bitterness. I’m looking forward to another one."
Dortmunder Gold,4.12,"Golden-orangeish color. Fresh aromas. Excellent balance of bitterness and sweetness. Very smooth and creamy. I actually like it more on the warmer side, though not quite room temp. Super lager."

Medium orange, with some caramel and amber overtones, in the appearance. Slightly sweet, medium caramelized malt aroma, with a touch of sweet spice and a tiny noble hop note. Very smooth, touch sweet, lightly spiced, moderately roasted and caramelized malt, with a very subtle, floral, noble hop aspect. Medium, creamy mouthfeel, and a caramelized malt and touch of hops, for the finish. Really good!"

F: Extra smooth semi-randy med-heavy mouthfeel with a clean, high-gloss medium length finish. It is lightly drying.
O: Light bitterness stays on top of the broad malt wave to complete a very full flavored clean drinking and overall semi-sweet American Dortmund Gold Lager. Rich and smooth it is very excellent in it's style."
Dortmunder Gold,4.81,Amazing classic Lager that has it all. It's been around since Great Lakes opened its doors and remains a top contender in this category.
Dortmunder Gold,4.1,"Pours a ""beery"" looking yellow with a white head that fades quickly leaving a lightly laced glass. Malty aroma with some mild hops, flavor follows with some ""bready"" notes. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied. I didn't think I'd care much for this one. I was wrong."
Dortmunder Gold,4.55,"Flavorful and refreshing, a long-time favorite summer beer for me. A year round fav, actually. Clear golden color, low to moderate carbonation, nice head dissolves pretty quickly, pleasing lacing, not too much. Moderately alchoholic, high fives. All in all, a superb, restrained brew, that doesn't cry out for attention. But you realize that it deserves attention: perfect balance of malt and hops, (for a lager, that is). To me, the equal of some of the most enjoyable lagers I've had in Germany."
Dortmunder Gold,4.09,I tended to avoid this because I thought the style was boring compared to others but sometimes you learn to appreciate a well crafted beer of any style.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.9,Coming back to this fabulous beer and writing a great review of this true standard of this style.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.45,Smooth and creamy.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,2.04,"World's oldest brewery? Really? I'm sure I have had the world's oldest brewery beer before, and it wasn't this...

I used to love weissbier when I was about 20...but recently I haven't really liked it so much, anyway let's give this a go. I used to have an Erdinger glass at home.

Very typical bananaey aroma...heavy...sweet like a desert...not really inviting to me. Very smooth head and deep orange colour, looks great in the glass.

Taste is unique for sure. Very different to other weissbiers I have tried, such as Erdinger (my favourite beer around 20 years old). This is much lighter and ever so smooth. And not as sweet as the aroma makes you believe...but for me it's a bit too smooth, and a bit too unexciting...there is no complex mouth feel or bitter hop aftertaste of a Radeberger, West Coast IPA or Belgian tripel. Or the mystical smoothness of a Chimay Bleu. This is kind of simple, pleasant...and easy to like. I'm definitely not a fan of wheat beer, though I kind of understand why people would like this, though...in the same way people like ice cream. It's just not for me."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,"The standard against which all Hefeweizens are compared. I honestly cannot find any fault with this beer. My favorite beer of all time, nothing comes close IMHO. Thank you Weihenstephaner!!! Prost!!!"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange with thick, high head.

Smell is fruity and yeasty with notes of banana, banana camdy, citrus, wheat dough and ginger.

Taste is fruity, yeasty and a bit sweet and estery. Notes of banana, cloves, banana camdy, peach, wheat dough and rye.

Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with good carbonation.

Overall, a terrific Hefe, maybe the best one overall."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.42,My favorite Hefe Weissbier by miles. Complex flavors that are well balanced and I like the amount of carbonation. A deep experience but also refreshing.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.89,From bottle at a pub in Germany. Lives up to the high rating. Looks perfect. Smells absolutely amazing. And the taste follows. Smooth as butter. Banana is the keyword here. Banana in both smell and taste. But not overpowering. Simply amazing!
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.46,"Beer poured from tap.

The body pours an orange gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention and lacing. A handsome beer especially in the right glassware.

Nose is the banana-bubble gum aroma for which the style is famous. Hit-or-miss for some folks, but a big hit for me. Add the familiar clove and I was a happy guy.

Taste substantially follows nose with the clove stepping up a bit. A bit sweet but a modest hop flavor is present helping balance the beer.

Good carbonation and mouthfeel make it an easy drinker."

Bottle Date: 6301
Consumed on: 2022-july-26
Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp:


Look:
Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass when I hold it up to a light. 3-finger pillowy and creamy off-white head slowly dissolves to a 1-finger consistent and creamy cover. When I opened the beer, it slowly started pushing up out of its bottle. Some yeast looks to have remained on the bottom of the bottle, indicating that this sample will not be as opaque as 'normal'.

Smell:
All kinds of banana along with some sweet fruit that has been lightly sugared. Balancing this is a nice clove note. Wonderful nose.

Taste:
Similar to the nose but with the addition of wheat notes that come across as very slightly bready or perhaps doughy. There is also a mineral note. Everything is very nicely balanced. The finish is lightly sweet and clovey.

Feel:
Smooth, soft, and creamy. The body is not quite medium.

Overall:
A great Hefeweizen from a top-notch brewery. Quaffable, balanced, and refreshing. This is the benchmark for the style and has been so for decades. One of my favorite Hefeweizens, along with those from Andechs, Ayinger, and Schneider."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.94,"Truly amazing beer. Definitely a must try and must have on hand beer. One in my regular rotation. It seems that cans are fresher than bottles where I am in the U.S.

Strong flavors of banana and cloves. Wheat lingers at all times."

On the pour a 1.5 finger fine head just over the glass that slowly receded and became rocky and creamy looking. Color is a dark gold with standard hefe haze. Carbonation is light enough that it's hard to see through the haze. Some lacing forms if you drink it fast enough but not the best lacing ever.

Aroma is full of banana esters and a bit of acetaldehyde but not anymore than is expected of the style. Aroma is relatively light and not a lot of the malts come through this is all yeast on the nose.

Flavor is similar to the aroma with a certain lightness to it followed by a nice hit of traditional hefe flavors, once again a little tarter than I'd prefer, but nothing overwhelming or out of character for the style. There is a definite minerality to the flavorfollowed by some light bitterness and grassiness from a light dose of noble hops. Followed up by all that a sweet wheat maltiness does creep in making for a nice finish with a bit of sweetness after yeasty slightly bitter flavors.

The feel is once again a bit light and astringent, but the head retention on this makes for a relatively balanced light feeling making it not watery. The finish is relatively long for how light it is and in the chest you can feel the alcohol warming sensation a little bit.

Overall this is a good example of a traditional hefeweisen and a bit drier than the hofbrau hefe but without the citrus notes of an americanized hefe or traditional American wheat."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.55,This is the standard that all other Hefeweizens are judged.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,It’s hard to find anything wrong with this.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,"LOOK: Golden orange/yellow, semi-hazy, two fingers of very fine foam.
SMELL: little bit of clove and hops, lots of banana.
TASTE: exactly like it smells in a snifter. Directly from the bottle, it’s 100% banana.
FEEL: very smooth and refreshing with medium body and medium-light carbonation.
OVERALL: This is, to me, a perfect beer. It’s insane. It’s refreshing with just enough body to it to be rewarding without feeling bloated afterwards. The tastes are lovely and perfectly balanced, and there’s a variation in flavors between the glass and the bottle that are both wonderful in their own way. The best part about it is that it’s not even expensive, either. It’s like $11 for a 6pk at my local liquor store. That’s only $2 more than a 6pk of Heineken for THIS."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.59,"Poured golden amber, not transparent but not cloudy either. Unfiltered?
The head was nearly white and fleeting but that may be due to the age of the beer.
The aroma was mostly cloves and, oddly, banana. At least the impression of banana.
The taste, wow. Cloves are prominent but not overwhelming, banana is more an essence than flavor, and the malts are balanced, tasty and rewarding. So good, I think I need more of this one for the summer.
The feel was smooth as the carbonation was slow and sparse, but present. Didn’t detract from the experience at all.
Not sure why I waited so long to try this, it’s really good!"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,5,"Wow. Poured at ~43 degrees F into a pint glass. Cloudy golden nectar with very fine bubbles in the finger of head that reduces to a film and a ring around the glass. If there was a banana Wheaties, this could be the mascot. Smell is, of course, banana, clove, nutmeg, as is taste, but more importantly, this beer does not include any of the previously stated foods as actual ingredients. This beer is brewed under the Purity Law of 1516, meaning it uses only malt, hops, water, and yeast. This philosophy of brewing has led to a masterpiece that lingers on the palette like you've just had a bowl of Cream of Wheat. Mouth feel is velvety creaminess; CO2 level perfectly present and fulfilling. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Very smooth going down with a a slightly less than medium mouthfeel. Super easy drinker even on a hot Texas day. Easily the best wheat brew I've ever tried."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.4,Good beer but I would still Choose Francisckiner over it but not bad for IvanBrew1 beer garden
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.45,Herbal and mild spice. Unfiltered liquid gold. Poured on tap in Philly in 1L mug.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.52,"A: cloves, nutmeg, yeasty, malt aroma
L: hazy golden, good head retention, creamy foam, medium lacing
T: banana clove heavy, medium to heavy bodied, crisp carbonation
O: very smooth, drinkable, essence of hefeweizen"
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.62,"Poured from 330 ml bottle into pint glass. Thick pillowy white head, mild lacing, hazy golden orange color. Aroma of banana, spices, yeast rolls. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Flavors of clove, cinnamon, banana, bread, herbal hops. Overall: excellent in the style."
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,4.17,"Poured from a 500mL glass bottle to my Weihenstephaner hefe glass, just about a finger and a half of dense foamy, uneven head appears. Cloudy orange with a tinge of yellow.

Strong bubblegum aroma hits me first, followed by banana. Gentle spices, of which clove is the most noticeable. Wheaty and gentle yeast ester smell, maybe the palest or grassy funk.

Of all the hefe’s, I have always found Weihenstephaner to be strongest on the bubblegum and banana, which it does not disappoint on the palate here. Of the sweet malt it is crackery like wheat dominated, rather than the doughy malt of Belgians. Great cereal grain taste on the finish. Cloves and mild white peppery like spices wane in and out. A bit of mint was apparent as well.

Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation of the effervescent kind, tight small bubbles create a mild prickliness on the top of your tongue and a semi foamy sip. A gentle finish, not dry nor wet, which leaves an essence of banana bread and grains on the tongue.

Two things here: firstly, I don’t think my bottle was the freshest. I am going to revisit this review down the line and do a side by side comparison. Secondly, Weihenstephaner is and always will be the first beer that got me into drinking good beer, foreign beer, and craft. Once I had it, I never looked back. It was not my gold standard for Hefeweizens, but beer in general. As stated, I have my own Weihenstephaner glass I drink all my wheat beers out of.

That said… I think in the years that have passed, I can’t really rank it as a 98 like it is on BA. It’s legendary with a strong backing, but in modern times I’ve had too many wheat beers that were so complex and just as good, I think the beer coasts just a little off of its legendary reputation. Keeping in mind, I do believe the beer is the standard bearer/gold standard of the style. It’s the absolute most classic, straight up example of the excellency of wheat beers. For most of its existence it might as well have been Zeus compared to all other beers. In modern times, however, many others have climbed Mt Olympus and taken their place beside it. I say all this despite unending nostalgia for the beer and being it’s biggest lover for well over a decade and a half. This is still a phenomenal beer, best of the old guard. I look forward to revisiting the review with the freshest bottle I can find!"
Racer X Double IPA,3.96,"A: crystal clear; copper in color; 1 finger finely pored light tan head that receded to a wispy cap; nice rings of lace;

S: very ripe pineapple;

T: follows the nose up front and at the end; in the middle, there's an added floral component; mild bitterness on the finish;

M: medium to full bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish;

O: a little too sweet for my taste;"
Racer X Double IPA,4.68,"On tap. Pours with a clear copper with creamy tan foam. Moderate retention, excellent lacing.
Very malty aroma with caramel and lemon hoppy notes.
Malt backbone carries strong grapefruit golden caramel and grahm cracker flavors running into a pleasantly bitter finish.

So nice to run into a west coast brew in the the overwhelming NEIPA market. A truly superb ale with outstanding balance. Drinks dangerously well and going back for another sip before they run out!"
Racer X Double IPA,4.25,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Surprised that I had not reviewed this before, have had several times. This is a great brew, don't think that it is distributed in MA anymore?"
Racer X Double IPA,4.25,"BB: 04/11/21
Consumed: 02/02/21

L: Pours a pale to medium amber with a medium chill haze. An aggressive pour yields a nice off-white 2 fingers of head. It has ok retention, but what's left is sticky and leaves nice webs of lacing as the beer recedes in the glass.

S: Citrus rind (grapefruit?), Citrus pulp (orange?), a bit of pine, and prominent caramel malt.

T: This is a hop bomb all right! I get blood orange on the front end flowing into the mid palate where it mixes with sweet caramel malt and sweet Valencia orange. The caramel malt continues and mixes with waves of pine resin bitterness on the finish. At first blush the sweetness is being balanced very well by the bitter finish, but as the beer warms the sweetness starts to win.

F: Medium-full body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit sticky with a dry finish.

O: This beer takes a bat made entirely of hops and smacks you in the face while simultaneously shanking you with a sharp malt shiv....old school to say the least. To me it is actually closer to some of the proto-NEIPAs or what we used to call East-coast IPAs; i.e. a nice strong bitterness, moderately sweet, and a nice dry finish. To me, though, this is a bit sweeter than an East-coast IPA. As the beer warms it becomes a bit more unbalanced as the sweetness starts to become more prominent in both the nose and palate. For me that detracts from the palate more so than the nose and it loses .25 to .5 in the taste column as a result. As it warms it is not as balanced as it's younger sibling. Either way, this is a great IPA and a safe harbor in a ""Locust Reign"" of NEIPAs. You should try it if you get a chance."
Racer X Double IPA,4.59,"16oz can, best by 4/11/21, into a Gandhi-Bot tulip.

L: Pours a clear, striking copper body beneath two fingers of dense, creamy tan foam. Moderate retention, excellent lacing. Beautifully old-school.

S: Balanced aroma of caramel malts and citrusy hops. Simple and classic.

T: The taste takes me straight back to my formative years as a craft beer drinker, massaging both hops and malt into a perfectly balanced, thoroughly assertive river of flavor. Grapefruit, pine, caramel, and biscuit are all present in equal measure, with everything wrapping up in a solidly bitter, resinous finish with just enough lingering caramel to keep things smooth. Delicious.

F: On the full side of medium-bodied with ample, velvety carbonation. Sticky in a good way.

O: Simply splendid, and not just for nostalgia’s sake. The hop/malt/alcohol balance is dialed in just right, with every component singing clearly and nothing dominating. Great stuff. Beers of Fame tick 202/250. Cheers!"
Alpha King,4.84,"Citrus and caramel aromas , with tastes of malt followed by a hop profile that doesn't overwhelm. Excellent classic APA."
Alpha King,4.07,"Look: It pours copper with an off white head. Head retention is excellent.

Smell: There are citrus aromas up front with some caramel. There are some pine notes in support with dried apricot notes.

Taste: It has a definitive malt presence with caramel and citrus. The balance is nearly even with a slight tilt towards the hops. In addition there are pine and dried apricots.

Feel: It has a medium body with strong bitterness in the finish without being harsh.

Overall, a very good pale ale that is slightly balanced towards the hops."
Alpha King,4.46,"No canned on date…
Appearance: Pours a dark orange copper, almost red in color. About a finger of white-yellow foam with good head retention and lacing down the glass. Translucent, but I think that is a more due to the color, there isn’t any floating sediment.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and bready caramel malts with a subtle sweetness. Notes of apricot and tangerine are also present. Prevailing sweetness is present from the middle to the back with caramel, rye bread, and slight toffee malts.

Taste: Bitter hops on the front end with pine, grapefruit, and orange rind that adds to the prevailing sweetness. I also get hints of apricot, tangerine, pineapple, and maybe some mango. Caramel and bready malt profile provides a solid back bone with a bit of rye spiciness on the back end.

Feel: Medium carbonation gives the smooth mouth feel and enhances the malt profile and flavors. Thicker than I remember and maybe that is because it is slightly older. Minimal alcohol warmness and overall enjoyable.

Overall: I think this beer is a bit on the older side, but certainly hasn’t gone bad. Malt flavors are a bit more pronounced, and the edge of the hops is taken off slightly but still enjoyable. Classic beer with great hops and beautiful supporting malt backbone. Always happy to enjoy this beer and I will definitely keep buying it."
Alpha King,4.16,"Amber with chill haze, dense white head, nice retention, awesome lace
Big pine (verging on aspirin) and grapefruit zest aroma
Flavor starts grapefruit zest, heads toward pine, then u-turns back to grapefruit rind
Medium-light bodied and appropriately carbonated
A well made WCIPA."
Alpha King,4.35,"Pours a slightly hazy light brown with a persistent fluffy head and lots of lacing.

Smells of slightly dank piney grassy hops with some citrus.

Tastes of hops and malt first followed by slightly tart citrus with a slightly bitter finish.

Medium light body with light prickly carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.

This hoppy ale could be considered to be a slightly lighter West Coast IPA. Very drinkable and well made."
Alpha King,4.26,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle. Copper in color, transparent, small but foamy head with decent lacing retention.

Smell - a balance of dried fruits, malts, and some sweet/syrupy notes. some hops also present, mostly pine and a bit of citrus. this is a complex one.

Taste - the taste is as complex as the smell. hop forward, but only moderately so. smoothed out by a wave of malts and syrup like sweetness. the hops come back in the end and leaves behind a long and slightly sweet finish - the kind typical of an exemplary IPA or hoppy ale.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderate in ABV at 6.66%.

Overall - for a flagship beer, this is remarkably complex and pretty damn tasty."
Alpha King,4.25,Pours a reddish brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of roasted malts. Taste starts slightly sweet but finishes with a hoppy bitterness.
Alpha King,4.94,I pretty much have had the best beers of my life with all of the 3 FLoyds I have had
Spotted Cow,3.27,"Pours a foggy yellow, nice white head collapses to a ring, some spotty lacing. Bready and grainy aroma. (are those real words). This is just one of thos beers that don't work for me."
Spotted Cow,4.39,"They call this a Saison, but think of it as a cream ale. Pale color and very unassuming nose, though the malt character is very nice. This beer really leans on its smoothness. Subtle fruit, toffee candy. Very soft and kind of foamy in a good way with barely an aftertaste. Ales like this aren't necessaily incredible, but they are incredibly hard to find in the other 49 states."
Spotted Cow,4.16,REFRESHING SAISON CLEAR CRISP SLIGHTLY MALT
Spotted Cow,3.97,"While I found my original review to be amusing, it was too dated to remain in light of my current notes, so I am starting fresh.

Barely foggy straw yellow with a white foam head of moderate height settling to a softly persistent blanket and wavy ridge.

Like a mild, floral hefe on the nose, and closer to a Belgian wit in taste--even including a hint of orange peel and wheat--this is such an enigma (not to be confused with their very own Enigma)!

The medium body has a fine froth that comes to a tingly semi-dry finish.

No wonder it has such staying power, there's nothing like it out there, yet it's still quite drinkable."
Spotted Cow,3.63,Proliferates all over Wisconsin but objectively tastes pretty bad. New Glarus makes good fruit beers but this one I could do without.
Spotted Cow,3.89,"Got this given to me by a guy who went to Wisconsin for family and brought home beer.
Poured amber with active carbonation and an off white head.
The aroma was faint for me, I think it had some malt or other cereal.
The taste was cereal and malts first and foremost. Nice enough, but a saison should have some funk or tart, right? Not sure if any are here. The taste is great, just not a saison flavor.
The feel was good, not viscous and not watered down, just nicely quaffable.
Glad I finally got to try this, cheers!"
Spotted Cow,3.9,"For the style, pretty darn good. Chris, refreshing and all you expect from a farmhouse style ale"
Spotted Cow,4.55,"Great beer brewed in my state. Classified by the brewery as a farmhouse ale, the flavors are not intense yet are tangy and refreshing. Tastes of grain, malt and yeast. Easy to see why it is absolutely everywhere in Wisconsin."
Spotted Cow,3.84,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Looks very good. Glassy yellow body with a generous white head. This maintains throughout, leaving scattered lacing.

Nice light belgiany aroma, a little yeast.

On tasting, light and clean, very easy drinking, has all the hallmarks of a saison, but very much subdued.

Mouth between medium and full, finish slightly grainy and a little yeasty.

Overall, a very nice light saison on a warm Pennsylvania evening."
Spotted Cow,3.93,"12oz can stamped I2221003 poured into a vintage footed bar glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on label. The beer pours just clearer than hefe-hazy in a medium amber color. The head is off white and settles to a ring and island after a few minutes. The aroma is mild with fruity and farmhouse esters. The taste is semisweet pale malt with mild clove and relatively minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent everyday beer. I don't know that I'd stretch and call it a farmhouse ale, but I'd drink it anytime it was offered."
Spotted Cow,4.05,"(Enjoyed on tap in a pint glass. Rated within the style)

L: Golden straw appearance, decent lacing and a medium lasting milk white head

S: biscuty, malty and non offensive

T: smooth sweet and airy. Bread and biscut flavors with well rounded hoppy earth bitterness on the back end

F: light medium mouthfeel medium heavy carbonation and it doesn't taste like a very dry beer, which is nice

O: Very common where I live so its cheap but overall its an excellent local craft beer"
Spotted Cow,4.13,This Ale is very easy to drink and has a wonderful malty-nutty flavor.
Spotted Cow,4,"I rated this 4 because I rated it a 4 on Untappd (so sue me,ok). It's a good, crushable beer. The description says they leave some yeast in it. The one I just had has more rustic/barnyard funk to it than the others of this I have had I suppose becsuse of the bottle conditioning. I never really have thought of this as a farmhouse ale, even though that's what Dan Carey calls it. It's a good beer, but certainly NOT the best beer New Glarus does. My overall issue with this beer is that with as many good beers as New Glarus does do, this one is the most ubiquitous. It's EVERYWHERE in Wisconsin. There are more beers I would rather have from them if Spotted Cow wasn't taking up so much shelf space."
Spotted Cow,2.66,"Looks slightly cloudy light gold, medium loose white head.
Has an average aroma of malt and mineral water, No funk or barnyard you expect from saisons.
Tastes like a kolsch, slightly malt forward, very average beer. They state on the can that they use German ale yeast, not sure how they can expect it to magically turn into a saison.
It’s not bad tasting, just not anything resembling a farm house style ale."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,"2019 version poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Morning Delight tulip glass. Toffee aroma. Taste is sweet malts, molasses, barrel. Smooth, sweet and boozy."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.26,"Bottle from Bottle Barn. Mahogany pour, fluffy head fades to tiny ring. Woody, toffee aroma, hint of booziness to come. Taste is sweet malts, molasses, barrel notes. Smooth, sweet and boozy. Wonderful."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.5,"Dark cloudy brown with lightly fuzzy hPead and lacing. Smell is boozy, malty, dark fruit notes, molasses, and brown sugar. Taste is boozy bourbon, sweet brown sugar and molasses, light dark fruit and vanilla notes. Medium bodied, mouth watering, and yes, boozy. Very good."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.56,"Opaque medium dark brown with a thick khaki ring. Huge barley with big fig dipped in toffee, bourbon, molasses, and supporting sugar plum, brown sugar and oak. Let it warm up as you sip and be amazed by the aromatic depth! Taste is just a powerful, though more booze and barrel centric. Same cast of characters from the nose, but more raisin now instead of fig with a touch of cola. Feel is warm to almost hot, robust with barley yet smooth with the malt textures, not syrupy but certainly viscous. Glad I finally got to try this beauty, sip and enjoy on a cool day. The wife liked it"
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.18,great tasting barley wine -malty with hints of bourbon
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.18,"Had on tap at Special Brews Lynnwood, WA"
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,3.75,"A little bitter, probably because it's young, but decent barleywine when warmer. Will probably age my other 2yrs. I enjoyed all other Midnight Sun beers more than this - Termination Dust, Tundra Wookie, Berserker"
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,1.79,"I shared a bottle with my brewing buddy it was one of three bottles I purchased. It is from 2019. The color was deep brown and very cloudy like sludge and a thin light tan head. The aroma was sugary sweet with a malt background. Very low hops as to be expected for an English barleywine. No fruit. Hot alcohol nose, fusal. The flavor was residual sugars and cloyingly sweet. Very low hop flavor, some malt but the strong sweetness over powered everything. Hot high alcohols. Full body, fat and flabby. Overall impression, what happened at the brewery in 2019? I purchased this beer due to the wonderful reviews of the earlier batches. The 2019 is very under attenuated or the mash temperature got way out of hand. It is under carbonated, fat and very undrinkable. Guys, clarity is important. I poured mine out, my buddy chocked his down so I asked him if he wanted the other two bottles, he said NO. I might try one of the other bottles on the off chance that one bottle had a problem but I doubt it."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.56,"taken from notes

2011 22oz bottle poured into a snifter, drank in 2015

Pours deep brown in color with a one-finger creamy off-white head that has short retention. Smells of caramel & toffee, molasses, brown sugar, earthy tobacco, leather, figs, raisins, wet oak, vanilla & bourbon, some sherry-like vinous notes and a hit of herbal tea. Flavors follow the nose with bold caramel and toffee notes, as well as a sherry-like sweetness, earthy tobacco and peppery oak, a variety of dark fruits on the finish with more caramel. Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and slightly warming finish. Simply an outstanding English Barleywine"
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.35,"Pours an opaque, dark copper brown. No translucence. Appearance is similar to apple cider. A finger of light khaki head. Medium lacing.

Nose is bourbon, caramel, and dark fruit. The bourbon really shines through here. Melding with caramel/toffee notes. Booze as it warms.

Taste is bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, toffee, moderate hoppiness. Starts with bourbon, hop flavor comes in after, then the smooth caramel which slowly fades into the malt finish. A very layered brew. It unravels more than it mixes with each other. It takes time to show each flavor, then it moves on to the next.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth with mild to medium carbonation.

A smooth delicate brew, with some bite to it. Hop quality and big booziness combined with bourbon and caramel provides a slow sipper to be respected and enjoyed."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.49,"2019 12 oz bottle poured aggressively room temp to a tulip. Head is three finger light tan tight-bubble that burns down to a thin persistent ring. Murky caramel color. Nose is sweet caramel and a faint bourbon if you stick your nose way down in there. First sips are a balanced hoppy/caramel twang up front, lots of booze but on the mid palate, and leaves a lot of flavor on the back. Mouthfeel is medium thick. It’s already warmed, so the profile isn’t changing much. Has a nice leather nose on each sip. Very quick hop to caramel to booze progression in the swallow. Booze is pretty hot, but never passes too much. Malt backbone keeps it solid and balanced. Reading the description, I can pull in the wine barrel vibe way down deep. Good drink!

2022 version update: Alcohol is much hotter up front, blunting the caramel notes but enhancing the stone fruit notes. Oak barrel is present, bringing wood notes and a drying mouthfeel. Price was raised significantly since last time ($12 to $20) for 375 ml. Considering how much it doesn’t bring, IMHO, it’s not worth that new price of admission."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.06,"Dirty, murky amber-brown body topped with a 1/2 finger-thick creamy head. Rich, malty aroma; caramel; phenolic; musty; boozy. Strong oak flavor nearly overpowers the rich caramel and toffee taste; a nudge of vanilla; pecan. Heavy body; thick and chewy; sludgy; warm.

Well, this one is a beast. In many ways, in hindsight, I would like to have tried this aged for at least a year or so. I think the wood barrel notes undercut the rest of the beer's fine points. I see where another reviewer (ref. @Benish, Oct 02, 2017) the beer was aged in bourbon barrels vice oak. I agree. The oak comes across too raw with this, but like I mentioned earlier, perhaps some judicious cellaring might tame the roughness. Well, it still has its high points..."
Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4.74,"Nice representation of the style. I keep looking for that 2013/2015 Great flavor in the English Barleywine style and this is the closet yet. The biggest difference is the mouthfeel. Great has this smoothness that honestly cannot be replicated. Despite that, I think I have found a more regular option to suit my needs in between the 4 year wait for Great."
G'Knight,3.99,"draught
Nearly clear, medium dark orange, with the slightest auburn tint. Nice, allspice tinged, medium dark toast caramel malt, with a bit of fruitiness, to the aroma. Some sharpness upfront, lightly astringent, bit of allspice/coriander type sweet spice in the background, with a bit of a floral note to the taste and finish."
G'Knight,4.25,"Appearance - The beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head.

Smell - The smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style.

Taste - The malts backbone was huge, leaving a trail of sweetness. The dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. Nothing was overpowering, and a dry finish left me thirsty for more.

Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the aftertaste to linger.

Overall - It has been too long since I had this one."
G'Knight,4.27,Terrific red imperial ale!!
G'Knight,3.12,"Too hoppy for my taste.
Otherwise a very solid beer for the style, but not red.
More of a slightly darker honey.
Old Chub is much better!
To me, this tastes like the rest of the IPA's in this style."
G'Knight,3.95,"12oz can.
L: Hazy, red/amber colour with two fingers of off-white suds that leave rings of lacing.
S: Malt and some subtle cinnamon spiciness.
T: Red liquorice, orange and caramel. Unusual. Alcohol heat follows, as does moderate hop bitterness.
F: Full bodied with slick mouthfeel.
O: A decent Autumnal red ale that also delivers a boozy hit. Not very subtle, however."
G'Knight,2.95,"Chilled 12 oz. can poured into a chilled mug. Canned 08/28/21 stamped on bottom of can. Consumed 11/06/21. My wife bought a single can of this randomly for me to try. It is the highest-ranked beer on this site that I have consumed to date, rated #3 in the Red Ale - Imperial style and #3,096 overall at time of writing.

L: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0

T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75

F: Not very easy or enjoyable to drink. 3.0

O: Not for me. 3.0"
G'Knight,3.92,"Yet another great Oskar offering! Beautiful to behold, with deeper colors at the top of the glass. I guess just because the top is wider? Anyway, a cool effect
Maybe just a little malty with the high alcohol content, but great mouthfeel."
G'Knight,4,"Nice foamy head. Reddish brown body. Smell is pine resin, pineapple, mango, and spice. Taste is bold- piney hops and mango dominate. Caramel malt and maybe even cinnamon come out in the body, but take a back seat to the hops. That being said, the bitterness is well balanced by malt sweetness. Feel is wet, and a lovely warmth is produced by the ABV. It’s a really good beer, and a great take on red ales. My only critique is that the malt character could be a bit more present."
G'Knight,3.27,"This beer has a slight harshness to its hops that mellows somewhat as it warms, but is nonetheless a discernable aftertaste."
G'Knight,4.46,"Delicious imperial red ale. Malty with spicy hops and a long dry finish. Flavors are pronounced and stick around a good long time. Chewy, caramel, lemon, vanilla, herbal spice. Lots going on. A powerhouse of flavor and texture. Very excellent brew to be savored."
G'Knight,3.58,"12 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. ""Canned 2/19/21@1:33 Cheers 2 Gordon"". Well, Gordon, I have no idea who you are or what you've done, but Cheers 2 you.

L---A rich reddish brown that turns out to just be deep amber. Off-white head faded to a ring fairly quickly and leaves good lacing.

S---Vaguely hoppy & malty. I can't identify specifics.

T---Same as the nose, vague hops & malts.

F---Medium bodied with very good carbonation.

O---Just not doing it for me. An otherwise excellent brewery, though."
G'Knight,3.62,"I 10000% need to have this more than once to get a better opinion, I definitely don't not like this, idk if ill come back to it once I get a better feel for its taste but this is definitely seems complex. Finkel and garf has a red ipa, which as I understand should be more malt driven, and I understand what they meant. This seems different, perhaps more hoppy, I think the alcohol is covered well, not like a lot of weldwerks doubles were I taste the alcohol. Its not that the malt isn't there....I need to have this again. It's good."
G'Knight,4.1,"definitely unusual and it works for me. ipa with a strong caramel note.
L: drinking from the can, and the can is cool.
S: pine, bitter citrus.
T: goes beyond the nose... get the pine, grapefruit but a good taste of caramel richness with just a bit of sweetness. works for me. bitterness grows through the aftertaste, and the final impression is actually pretty bitter. strange but it works.
F: smooth, rich. nice.
O: different but different in a good way."
G'Knight,4,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Reviewed from memory, as I have not had in a while, have had at least a four-pack."
G'Knight,3.61,"Not a huge fan of most ipas, but this one's not half bad. It's not as hoppy as a lot of them, and has a lighter carbonation. At 8.7% pits a not a bad choice. If you like ipas with a little less hops I would recommend."
G'Knight,4.26,Haven't had many red IPA's but this one is delicious. Super easy to drink. May be the best red ale I've ever had.
G'Knight,4.25,"A real beauty to look at; the reddish amber body is topped it a large khaki colored head that left plenty of lacing. Laid back aroma features an array of hops, pine being the most prominent, although there is some caramel lurking in the background. Hops continue to dominate the taste. Pine is still present but joined by herbal, floral notes. Tongues a-tingling heading to the aftertaste where that caramel sweetness makes another brief appearance. Noticing a bit of grapefruit as well. Lingering well carbonated finish."
G'Knight,4.31,"Appearance: Deep copper color, about two fingers of foam.
Smell: Hoppy. Some type of candied fruit. Grapefruit.
Taste: Sweet and bitter. Puckery. I don't think I can pin down any one flavor. Grapefruit rind comes to mind. Maybe some simple syrup. Maybe some sugar cookie. Everything just kind of blends together.
Feel: Silky. Oily.
Taste: Yeah that's some good shit."
G'Knight,2.63,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a massive 3F mid tan foamy head sits atop a medium amber beer about 40% transparent. Lace starts at the top and slides down the glass as the head slowly sinks over several minutes.

On the nose I get sweaty salty hops predominantly with hints of yeast and mash and some mystery note.

Taste is caramel malt at first then bitter hop and a boozy finish. The unidentified note is a pine resin hops trying to hide the alcohol astringency. A hint of thymol makes this a bit too booze like for me.

Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation that acts as a catalyst to the thymol, piney alcohol and creates a tingly aftertaste. This takes away from the initial malt notes and finishes slick and sticky.

This beer has just too much alcohol and bitterness for me. Parts of the flavor profile hint at schnapps in a beer boilermaker. The Listerine aftertaste is a major turnoff for me. Struggling to get through the rest of the glass, yup drain pour."
G'Knight,4.34,"LOOK - quite hazy - deep orange/slight copper - nice soapy foam - great head retention - foam clings to the glass
SMELL - pine, grapefruit, and some mango - some woodsy/campfire notes - caramel as well
TASTE - huge blast of hops but not as bitter as I anticipated - super tropical and some citrus - some pine and mango - partially sweet but mostly tart with a nice hop bite
FEEL - a bit thinner that hoped for but still a nice medium body - great carbonation - activity level is high
OVERALL - a very good Imperial IPA from Oskar B's - never had a bad brew from them - this is a powerful brew - a taste bud killer - very hoppy and a decent carmelly sweetness to help balance it out - one of the better IIPA / RIPAs out there"
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.5,"Pours a deep brown with a finger of mocha head. Nose is brown sugar, molasses, alcohol bite, and toasted malt. Taste follows suit with deep undertones of black cherry and prunes. Feel is full and thick. Overall, well above average. Best beer I’ve had in a while."
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.51,"a: murky, deep dark red/brown/purple mixture. seeing some pale brown when held up to a light. no real head to speak of, though it has a tan film around the edge of the glass; to be expected with the abv i suppose

s: huge aroma on this. fig, plum, raisins, prunes. molasses, brown sugar, leather, and something like a roasted robust woody note. lots of sweet caramel, fruit bread, and candied strawberries. huge malty backbone. fantastic aroma

t: oh my, this follows the nose pretty close. huge caramel and fig upfront. plums, raisins, molasses, brown sugar behind that. big bready backbone. fruit bread, and caramel red apples. a little bit of sweet cherry juice as well. no real alcohol presence, which is impressive given the abv

m: full mouthfeel with strong carbonation

o: absolutely fantastic beer. the rating on here is definitely deserved - this should be a benchmark for the style. so robust and complex, while hiding it's abv. a great beer to share"
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.21,"Pours brown with ruby highlights. The foamy tan head diminishes pretty quickly after pouring. Big time nose of raisins and figs. Very smooth on the palate--a nice medium-bodied ale. Told it ages well but couldn't resist this 2021 effort early in 2022. For a younger ale of this type, it was very smooth even without too much additional aging. The flavors are rich and as they are described, primarily dark fruit (plums), caramel and gently roasted malts. A treat worthy of an Emperor."
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,5,This is my favorite beer of all time!
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.17,"2017 edition. From the bottle, it pours a brown color with reddish highlights and a nice light brown head that slowly reduces. Dark fruit, raisins, in the nose. The mouth gets that, along with expected malt flavors and a bready taste. Ages well!"
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.29,"Look: It pours dark brown with a tan head. Head retention is medium.

Smell: Malty rich aromas with strong dark fruits. It has caramel notes with plums and dried cherries. There is some spice in support. It also has light perfumy notes in the background as well.

Taste: The malt flavors are highlighted by deep caramel and a bit of bread. There are plums and dried cherries with a bit of a molasses like element to it. There is a bit of spice well in the background.

Feel: It has a medium full body with a dry finish in spite of the initial sweetness.

Overall, for such a strong alcohol beer, the alcohol is pleasant and warming without any harsh alcohols. A good combination of flavors from the malt, hops and yeast."
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,3.99,"Bottle, RBESG 2005 Grand Tasting. Golden brown colour. Vinous aroma, oaky and sherry notes. Oaky flavour, brandy notes. Quite sweet, but a very good beer."
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,2.93,"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name, ABV% and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Beautiful very dark ruby/chestnut-brown. Worth holding up right by a halogen type bulb to see it clearly. On which note it has poured clear, with a 2Cm creamy looking pale-tan head. [ps @+20mins, holds well, forms much lacing on the way down]
S- Very deep rich roasted malts.
[Off-topic: Right at this point I received a text from the NHS inviting me to go for my 1st Covid vaccination this week; hurrah! If this were a monastic beer I might give my thanks to 'Him upstairs' hehe. A few minutes replying to that had had the side benefit of raising the temp a touch from fridge cold :) ]
T- Deep, pungent, notes of deep roast fruit (akin to British Xmas pudding). There are some sweet notes coming in as it warms a touch but capped by a mild ABV% + hoppy-dry lick across the palate into the finish.
F- It is pushing the line between rich (=fine) and sweet (=not fine at all for me) very hard. In fact it crosses it, for me this is beyong rich and into outright sweet. Seems I shouldn't have been distracted, shouldn't have let this warm at all... hehe...
O- It looks and smells great. Unfortunately the outright sweetness here overwhelms just about everything else for me. And it's not like I'm into hop/dry dominated beer at all, this just is sweet. Not one I would drink again even if offered a glass of it; a big shame as I was anticipating that this would be something really impressive. I mean you don't buy 750ml bottles of a new $-beer without high expectations.

Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.38,"11.2oz bottle vintage 2018 poured into a tulip glass at just above fridge temp 11% ABV. The beer pours dark chestnut in color with light brown head. The head recedes to an irregular ring and single layer of bubbles. Streaky, but complete lacing. The aroma is mild with malt, candi sugar and dark fruits. The taste is a semisweet mix of dark & rich caramel, malt and dark fruit (raisin, date, plum) before a mild to moderate final bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Nicely balanced. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, excellent. Outstanding example of a BSDA."
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.82,"Appearance:
A murky, burnished bronze topped by a fluffy lather of tanned beige.

Bouquet:
A brisk updraft of single malt grain, like the kind they use for whiskey. A cape of molasses blended with brown wheat bread billows from its shoulders, set aloft by a gentle breeze of oaked vanilla. Miles and miles away from this gregarious forefront, the teeniest, tiniest molecule of milk chocolate can be detected by those with a gifted sense of smell.

Feel:
A sumptuous, syrupy full body whose imminent smoothness is given a spark of life by a calm, consistent current of carbonation. Finishes with a cozy, grain alcohol warmth.

Taste:
Here, characteristics of the bouquet are regally magnified on the palate: sugary vanilla and brown wheat with a firm core of oak. Behind the balanced sweetness lies a languid, tingling whiskey heat with candied figs in the aftertaste.

Special notes:
Bottle aged for 3 years"
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,3.96,"750 ml 2016 bottle. Looks good, smells very rich with hints of fruit, roast and strength. Tremendous dark fruit and dark bready malt flavors blend well with yeast spiciness and abv to create a powerful, sipping, after-dinner beer that is both filling and intoxicating. Very well balanced, but at the top end of my sweetness scale."

Review: 152"
Gouden Carolus Cuvée Van De Keizer Imperial Dark,4.22,"Dark reddish auburn color, ample tan foam depositing a halo of lacing around the edges, long lasting surface coverage. Ruby highlight glints in the meniscus of the glass.

Aroma is malt forward, toasted bread crusts and caramelized sugars. A touch metallic initially when opened, but it passes after a few minutes.

Creamy malty base with ample dried fruit esters. Plum and raisin, dark fruit forward. Bready malt with creme brulee sweetness, lightly phenolic and warming. Medium bodied, with a very smooth creamy texture. Dry aftertaste, mild leaf tobacco.

Overall this is a classic BSDA, and I might enjoy this even more than Rochefort 10."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.03,Friend of mine went to Wisconsin and brought this back. Poured into a snifter as recommended and immediately caught the whiff of the cherries. This followed with the sweet and tart flavor of cherry and some hint of the bitterness on the finish. Expected more of the oak like a Cabernet but none to be found. Overall a great beer for it's kind.
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.38,Sweet and sour cherry goodness.
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.66,"Made me see god.

More detailed review when I find a way to try again and properly appreciate the experience. This beer is something special."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.47,Very tart beer. Nose is strong. For what it is very good.
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.36,"Pours a solid burgundy with a firm haze / fog to the transparency. Head is two fingers of fluffy off-white foam.

Aroma is big cherry with a ripe fleshy quality. Cherries lean mostly sweet, but possess a slight funky tartness at the back. The only other dominating note is red grape, which comes in at the mid-way point, lingering through the finish. It adds a jammy sweet note to the mix. Despite the listing of numerous sweet notes, the aroma remains well balanced, with a mild funky twist at the end. It's not a lactic sour, jaw tensing sourness, instead, a playful nudge back to balance.

Flavor profile is fresh cherry right out front. It's sweet, plump, and carries a very light funk to it. The back of the flavor profile is adorned by red grapes. The rest of the mix is green apple, pear, lemongrass, cellar stone, and herbal and medicinal hops. There is a twist of cough drop syrup cherry at the back, which is the detriment to each sip. It's lead with sweetness, which carries through the whole profile, being countered right at the end by a twang of funky sourness. It's not overtly sour though, acting just enough to tip the scale from sweet to balanced.

Mouth feel has a crisp texture adorned by a consistent, tight effervescence. It has a medium effervescence, neither hard, nor soft. Thickness is medium as well.

Overall, a delicious beer driven by cherries. It remains remarkably well balanced, despite leaning on the sweet fruit of cherry to flavor it.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours a nearly-opaque deep garnet red, and forms a couple fingers of off-white foam with decent retention.

S: Sweet and laden with plenty of cherry.

T: Follows the nose precisely. This drinks quite sweet, with just a hint of subtle tartness to offset that as it moves along. It is rich with cherry flavor, and manages to be so without veering even slightly into medicinal territory. There are some soft woody notes in the backdrop, alongside some faint malt.

F: Medium and sticky.

O: A delight."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.42,"If you like fruity beers or ciders, this is awesome. Deep cherry tartness, with a hint of what tastes like gingerbread and smooth maltiness. Almost sweet but not at all cloying."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.5,"Reddish brown color with a light tan head with a touch of pink. Huge cherry aromas! Taste is
predominantly cherries with a taste of malt. Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Just a superbly balanced fruit beer that is not overly sour or cloying. Well done."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.35,"Cherry, cherry, and cherry! In some beers, that can be overwhelming and even cloying, a touch medicinal - like cough syrup. That's not the case here. The cherry flavors are huge, but natural and balanced, not unlike biting into a ripe, semi-sweet cherry.

The cherry notes are balanced by a very light but noticeable sourness; the cherries themselves aren't overly tart, but combined with the mild sourness of the beer, it creates a lovely overall experience. Additional tasting notes of oak and vanilla.

This beer is 100% as advertised, and delicious."

This beer pours mahogany with some rust colored highlights when held to the light. It is topped with a minimal tan head that leaves spotty lacing.

Wonderful tart cherry aroma. I also get some maraschino cherry. Cherry juice. It smells a lot like cherries.

And I thought it smelled like cherries. the taste is a cherry medley. I get tart and sweet cherry flavor. Very subtle acidity.

Medium bodied with a syrupy mouthfeel

Pure cherry goodness. I am amazed at how well this beer held up for 8 years. I was worried I held onto it for too long. Fears have been allayed. Great beer. Sad that I have no more now."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.57,"12oz bottle, no date (but from 2021) served in a snifter.

Appearance: Clear ruby red color with a thin off-white rocky foam. Lots and lots of fine strands of lacing all over the glass.

Smell: Tart fresh cherry and a bit of underlying floral aroma. Very nice.

Taste: Tart cherry perfectly balanced with sweet malt and a mildly bitter finish that complements the whole thing. Some additional fruity esters noted in all of this.

Mouthfeel: Slick, very nick thickness, a bit sticky, light carbonation, but it works with the overall character of this beer.

Overall / Drinkability: Very very nice. I want to pair this with a dessert, but by itself it's a great beer. I can see why this beer is rated so highly. Definitely does fit the profile of a Belgian ale, and not exceedingly tart or sour - just right all around. Well done!"
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.56,"Pale burgundy/cherry juice color; fast fizzy pinkish off-white head; excellent clarity; no cap, ring nor lace. Strong cherries nose. Taste is cherries; semi sweet with a touch of tartness. Clean feel; light body; moderate minus carbonation. A wonderful fruited ale; overall, a world class beer!"
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.2,"From a bottle. Pour has a very thin layer of white foam that leaves some wisps behind floating atop a vibrant clear and red body. Scent is cherry forward with notes of the wine/barley pairing and the long cask time lingering on the nose. Taste is a fascinating journey: cherry sweet/tart flavors bounce around on the nose, a bit of carbonation erupts on the tongue, and lingering and muted wine-like tastes are evident. Feel is medium bodied, at times on the heavier side, with a phenomenal aftertaste of cherry sweetness welcoming another quaff. A very interesting brew!"
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.34,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into my New Glarus stemmed glass. This beer is a rusty red, clear, with plenty of carbonation. The head is one finger of off white foam that settled back to a thin cap after a few minutes.
The aroma is light, sweet cherry and malt.
The flavor is tart, but sweet cherries, and a very subtle hint of oak.
There is a fizzy feel, almost like champagne. The tart cherry flavor keeps you coming back for more. This is very easy to slip this offering down.
Is it beer or wine? I don't know, but it is good!"
Wisconsin Belgian Red,5,Delicious beer. Intense cherry flavor with a slight hop finish. This is a very well balanced brew hats off to New Glarus. This is an awesome beer!!!!!
Wisconsin Belgian Red,4.79,"Review 1499

I have wanted to try this beer for quite some time now. I finally have the chance to try this beer, thank you, Jay, much appreciated. The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average.

The initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out.

The flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical.

The mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish.

Is this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly. I wish I had many more in the fridge."
Wisconsin Belgian Red,3.87,"Nice rich red that's got some brown to it. Dirty head that sticks to the sides, before retreating to swirl and ring.

Nose is boldly sweet cherries. Candied cherries. It's just straight candied cherries. Maybe a hint of spices (clove, cinnamon), but through and through this is sweet sweet cherries. Not quite maraschino, but almost. The missus loves it. It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like.

Thankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here.
The flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.

As stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe.

This is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.

Much gratitude to @FBarber for sending this along my way during NBW BIF #13! Thanks Frank!"

Harvest Ale,4.43,"I normally am not a big fan of IPA's but this one is really good. It is not overly hoppy and bitter, which is a plus in my book. It does have a citrus tang, which is not overpowering and is actually a nice flavor. Anyway, I recommend this to those who normally are not IPA drinkers. Founder's seems to make pretty good stuff."
Harvest Ale,4.25,"L: Golden yellow. Clear. Super foamy so pour cold and gently.

S: Piney and resiny (almost soapy) to the extreme.

T: Reminds me of a Benjamin Danklin from Fat Heads. I'm pretty sure that ""Wet Hop"" means they use an actual plant, and it tastes like an actual plant. That said, I can count the number of commercial brews with actual plants on them on one hand, and this is one of them.

F: I hope you like alpha oils.

O: It's a Fall to Winter seasonal and if you get a supply it will hold you over until Lake Eerie Monster and Danklin come out."

Tjis has a light medium body with light prickly carbonation, leading to a very refreshing beer, shocking for the abv. Finishes nicely dry and a touch bitter

Harvest Ale,3.98,"A perfectly festive beer for October and then the holidays...

This is one of those smacks-you-in-the-mouth hoppy beers. Calling it hop-forward really doesn't do it justice. Great lacing to go along with a copperish colored beer, and the smell is not only citrusy but fruity at the same time. The only nit I have has to do with it's somewhat watery mouthfeel, but it's mostly overlooked by the overall experience you enjoy with this IPA."
Reaction State,4.71,"Outstanding beer. Standard stout appearance. Smell presents with barrel and maple first, while coffee, vanilla, and cocoa provide a subtle background. Same notes on the taste with an additional cinnamon bite, very well balanced. A slight oiliness and thickness, medium to big body, boozy. I’ve always wanted to try one of their barrel aged stouts. This did not disappoint."
Reaction State,4.75,Nearly perfect.
Reaction State,4.08,"Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poured a deep black color with dark brown bottles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - In the nose, the cinnamon lead the way with modest sweetness.

Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had some viscosity, allowing the main profile to linger.

Overall - This one was a bit of a letdown for me."
Moloko,4.42,"248 / 250 BA Beers of Fame

Moloko,3.93,"In a pint pub glass. Pours almost black, with a slight tan head that fades quickly, slight lacing. Smell is a tiny bit of chocolate and some malt, but oddly not strong at all. Taste is smooth and sweet, mild chocolate and roasted malt, maybe a touch of vanilla. For an 8%, doesn't have an alcohol burn at all, feels very smooth, dry finish that fades quickly."
Moloko,4.09,"Very nice milk stout tried on tap at 3 Floyds. Pours nice black opaque color with a little film of off-white head and just a little spotty lingering lacing. Smells of some milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toasted nuttiness, caramel, vanilla, malt and toast. Taste follows the nose, not quite as sweet as I was expecting but well balanced and very easy to drink. Higher ABV was extremely well hidden. Smooth mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. A nice offering."
Moloko,4.02,"L: Pitch black with a short lived tan head. No lacing.

S: Muted smells of cocoa nibs, sweetness, and roasted malts.

T: Low bitterness, and otherwise an amplified take on the aroma.

F: Full-bodied and oaty smooth.

O: A good and not overly sweet milk stout."
Moloko,3.73,"Really thin for a milk stout, especially with an 8.0% ABV. Smell is what I expected. Tastes like a typical stout but with a weird, fruity, bitter finish. It's like some magical Willy Wonka beer that starts at watery milk stout but somehow turns into an IPA in your mouth. Which would probably be a good thing if I liked IPAs..."
Moloko,4.25,"12oz bottle served in a tulip stout glass. No date on bottle but since I just picked it up recently in the new release section of the local beer store (Belmont Party Supply), I'm going to assume a 2019 bottling.

Appearance: Pitch black with a dark tan head. Persistent thin head/ring with some fine strands of lacing.

Smell: A little bit of roasted malt with a metallic note. A bit unusual.

Taste: Roasted malt blending with a distinct lactose sweetness that has hints of vanilla as well. Maybe even a bit of marshmallow as well. The finish has some aspects of plum and a lingering bitterness for balance. Maybe some cherry at the finish as well. Very tasty beer.

Mouthfeel: Nicely thick and creamy. Just right carbonation. Surprisingly dry finish.

Overall / Drinkability: While not much aroma, this beer is really something else in taste and mouthfeel. Rich and sweet - nicely drinkable by itself after dinner as a dessert, but I wish I had some cake to pair this with. Quite delightful and something I will have to pick up again."
Moloko,4.03,"12oz bottle. Thanks to Ken for giving me a bottle to try! Somehow, I have only drank this beer once - at a beer tasting at Ken's in 2009 or 2010. Thick pitch black pour with a foamy light brown head. Roasty aroma with oats, dark chocolate, and lactose. Rich blend of flavors: dark chocolate, oats, roasted barley, char/ash, sweet lactose, and mild earthy hops. Full creamy & smooth body, pleasant carbonation, balanced finish with char lingering. Just as good as I remember - the only thing I wasn't crazy over was the amount of char flavor; it made it oddly bitter as it lingered on the palate."
Moloko,4.04,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 8/27/19, so 2 months old.

Classic look, black body with a coffee with a dash of cream head. This persists in some form throughout leaving some nice lacing.

Roasty, some apple core, and a faint soy aroma. Uh-oh.

Thankfully, the soy doesn't come through on the taste. It's slightly sweet. There is a roasted malt presence, but it's not overdone. A little smoky. Nice warmth from the abv. Good balance, and a nice tasting milk stout.

Mouth manages to be both full, and toward the end, a little watery. Finish is a warm, faintly sweet roast.

Overall, aside from the faint soy on the nose, this was a pretty enjoyable beer. Happy to have another 5 in the fridge."
Moloko,4.32,"LOOK - dark dark / black - started with a 2 finger head that was a dark khaki color - head retention was not the best
SMELL - some coffee and chocolate - some burnt wood and heavily toasted bread - slight caramel and herbal hops
TASTE - wow - a huge blast of charred wood and burnt toast - some hop bitterness I believe - some chocolate and brown sugar come in next - sweetens up a bit to offset the bitter charred grains just before rushing back to campfire and heavily toasted marshmallows (I actually get a dark roasted / burnt marshmallow flavor in there!!) Very complex - not as much sweetness as I thought for a milk stout but just enough to not be too heavy on the bitter black malt side
FEEL - nice and thick! - very much a full bodied beer - slippery/oily - could have used a bit more carbonation as it tended to trail off after 5-6 minutes
OVERALL - this is a great beer from 3F - I live in Colorado and this year they brought out some of their beers for GABF week and I grabbed as many as I could - I may go back and see if any more of these are lingering out there - very flavorful and complex - very happy"
Moloko,4.06,"12oz bottled 8/27/19 (one month ago) poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp, no ABV listed on bottle. The beer pours dense black with no light penetration and abundant mocha colored head. The head recedes slowly to a cap and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is mild with coffee, roasted malt and lactose. The taste is semisweet caramel, chocolate and coffee all mixed up with a fairly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a semi dry finish. No trace of the 8% ABV listed on the website. Nothing cloying or overly sweet. Overall, very good. A nice, flavorful take on the style."
Moloko,3.9,"Bottled 8/5/14; drank 8/10/14 @ the Yarchives.

Brown/black liquid.

Dark tan head; thick, frothy lace.

Oats, milk chocolate, rich cream & roasted coffee nose.

Thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Cream, milk chocolate & oats in the flavor; a sweet, nearly cloying finish.

Good, but perhaps a couple months might reduce the sweetness for the better."
Moloko,3.87,"Big, two finger dark brown head atop an inviting black brew. Head retention is excellent.

Roasty nose: burnt toast, black coffee, bitter chocolate. Milk and cream; a hint of vanilla. Toffee and a bit of molasses.

Slightly sharper on the palate. Bitter and roasty, especially on the back half, with tons of roasted barley leading to a slightly ashy, charred representation of toast, caramel, and coffee. A bit of sour, red grape up front.

Smooth and creamy mouthfeel; medium bodied, pretty much right on for an 8% ABV brew."
Moloko,2.97,"Look: Opaque black with some cola highlights. The head is espresso creama colored.
Smell: Rich dark chocolate, burnt toast edges, cold brewed coffee, milk chocolate sweetness, a vaporous alcohol, a hint of cream, dried figs, and a mild bitterness.
Taste: Dark chocolate and cherry Dr Pepper on the attack. The attack has this strange aqueous quality that reinforces the Dr Pepper flavor. This aqueous note open the gate for a clean body of milk chocolate, over creamed cold brewed coffee, and cherry notes. The finish holds all the roast with a mildly bitter burnt toast note, a light alcohol, and some hoppy pine bitterness.
Feel: Medium bodied with that strange watery middle. Mild bitterness. Medium sweetness. Medium alcohol. Prickly carbonation. The finish is off dry and sticky.

Overall: A milk stout I really didn’t enjoy. That watery soda body really threw me off. I would like some more body to this. Also, more balance to the sweetness and the roast would help too. Not a fan of this one."
Delirium Tremens,4.42,"Amazing smell.
Beer hits the tongue smooth, fruity and malty, very dry with a lasting bitter aftertaste.
Unique beer for me so far."
Delirium Tremens,4.86,"Poured Into a chilled mug......
Color of white Blonde like Blondie.....bleach blondes are hot...!!
Woooaaa, slow the pour down!!! This brew has a foamy head that simply did not dissapate!...The foamiest frigginn' head I have ever seen in a beer peroid?!?!......
Spicy hops smell, traditional with Belguin beers...
Of the bat Spicy mild hops deep and rich....Floral right away...then notes of crackers, lemon peel and honey!! Dis beer is da bomb!!! @ 9 Percent ABV you can hardly tell...sign of a great beer.
Good carbonated, bubbly....

I got this brew cuz it looked cool, a Pink elephant on the bottle......one word..Induction..I had some belgian beers but this tops any since Sam Adams Belgiun Session beer. lol

I got it at total wine, I suggest anyone to pick one up."
Delirium Tremens,4.68,"LOOK: Blonde Orange, Coarse head about 2 fingers
SMELL: Malt and Alcohol. Nothing too complex.
TASTE: Surprisingly light and mellow. Strawberry and Banana as other reviews have noted. Very pleasant, especially considering the ABV.
FEEL: Heavily carbonated but not too thick.
OVERALL: I would drink this from the tap if I could. A perfect beer for any occasion."
Delirium Tremens,4.49,"Have had it many times, but this is the first time to review it here.
Had to pour it in a classic Belgium goblet
Its lighter in color that I remember it.
Lots of carbonation

Definitely getting the strawberry banana on the taste.
This beer is an amazing example of a quality Belgium beer. You cannot go wrong picking up one of these"
Delirium Tremens,3.95,"Yeast, spice, strawberry, banana. End of story. Not bad."
Delirium Tremens,5,one of my favorites :)
Delirium Tremens,4.75,"All the reviews are spot on. Splendid Belgian...spice, citrus, bitter/dry, strong/pleasant aftertaste."
Delirium Tremens,4.08,"750ml corked and caged with a 2.20 date printed on the cork. Opened 1-22-22.
Big pop upon uncorking. 2 finger white head with a fine bead and lengthy retention. Yellow gold with a bit of a chill haze and tons of active carbonation. Apricot, floral, and marmalade in an appealing perfume. Yeasty, spicy notes as the beer warms, some orange/citrus and a grassy hop late in the flavor. Light body, high carbonation. Some heat in a finish that is spicy, initially lightly sweet but ultimately finishes dry. Very Good to Outstanding."
Delirium Tremens,4.93,"So clean and refined, crystal clear and golden , extremely refreshing, really picking up the orange citrus zing right now. Great belgian blonde strong pale."
Bravo 2017,4.3,"August 2022: Poured an opaque brown with a small light brown collar [fridge temp]

Aroma of prunes, molasses, bread, wood, bourbon with some alcohol notes.

Taste of of dark bread, prunes, chocolate, figs, fudge, vanilla. Some winey taste in there too. Definitely evolved as it warmed. Got better and better [or that could be the alcohol talking]

Mouthfeel was somewhat heavy on the tongue

Overall, very nice especially given its age. Held up well over the years. The beer reminded me of a warm blanket sitting in front of a fire. Nice."
Bravo 2017,4.25,"Look: relatively clear amber. Reddish tan head.
Smell: bready, brown sugar, slight hint of bourbon and vanilla.
Taste: like the nose. Super smooth after 4 years."
Bravo 2017,4.32,"2017 vintage bottle. How have I not rated this yet? Murky copper colored pour, a few bubbles. Boozy aroma, dark malts. Taste is sweet and nutty followed by a rising burn. Some raisiny elements also. Superb!"
Bravo 2017,4.35,"January, 2021. Poured from fridge temp. A small amount of head. Pours murky brown/reddish. Nose is very nice. Apples, figs, plums, toffee, candy, rye bread, and a bit of bourbon. The taste is incredibly smooth and delicious. Huge toffee, figs, cherries, almonds, fudge brownie, bourbon, and a touch of charred wood. Maybe a bit of leather in the aftertaste, but not in a bad way. This has aged very well! The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice long aftertaste."
Bravo 2017,4.56,"Bravo 2017
Dark amber body with beautiful ruby reflections. Ocher head with coarse grain and little persistence. Aroma: chocolate, molasses, cherries, plums, vanilla, wood, whiskey. Taste: chocolate, caramel, dark fruit in alcohol, dehydrated fruit, vanilla, light roasts, bourbon. Aftertaste with a very long elegant and warm ethyl trail. Medium and velvety body. Low and fine carbonation. Classy drink."
Bravo 2017,4.5,"Imperial in nature and slumbered in bourbon barrels, a unique flavor of strength and regality simply oozes from this nearly 4-year aged Firestone Walker Brown Ale.

With a truly handsome garnet, crimson and bronzen pour, Bravo '17 releases a creamy densely woven froth and a sultry scent of toasted chocolate, coffee, caramel and nuttiness with a tingle of whisky spice upon the nose. Its complex and deeply woven maltiness rounds the early palate with those chocolate, toffee, brown sugar and sorghum sweetness to evoke thoughts of horehound candy.

With its sweetness relaxing gently on the middle palate, the more savory and earthy nuances of coffee bring about a toasty, pecan, chicory spice and sarsaparilla character with a light and woodsy bitterness to balance late in taste. Much like a fine and syrupy liquor, Bravo carries a bittersweet finish with the caramel, vanilla and oaken char of bourbon to close.

Full bodied but never lumbering to the palate, the finish comes strikingly drinkable and effortless for such strength. Its spicy whisky warmth simmers on the throat with hints of campfire and tobacco in aftertaste. A truly masterful beer."
Bravo 2017,4.27,"The look is unremarkable, just a brown ale with a light head. The smell is lots of bourbon. The taste is bourbon, some very light caramel. It's not sweet, which is slightly unexpected. The body is thin. Overall, this is a little like an English barleywine, but thinner and lighter. It's aged very well, and is super smooth. Well worth seeking out, but I doubt you can find it."
Bravo 2017,4.29,"2017 vintage tasted in a Rastal Teku from a 12 fl oz bottle on April 28, 2020."
Bravo 2017,4.25,"Pours a medium brown / amber color, fairly clear, minimal head. Great malty aroma, lots of caramel, some toffee, brown sugar. Flavor follows nose: brown sugar, sweet caramel, toffee, molasses. Feel is medium bodied, carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a really good BA brown ale, aged nicely.

Bravo 2017,4.32,"Pours a deep mahogany with a thin head of foam. In spite of my best pour, I couldn't keep a bunch of floaters out. NBD. Smell has lots of toffee and dried, dark fruit, with a touch of bourbon. Taste follows. Very complex and delicious."
Bravo 2017,4.75,11/28/19 bottle @ home; 2017 vintage
Bravo 2017,4.46,"I LOVE the bourbon smell and character of this beer. I like it most in a thick stout, but in this brown ale it still holds great complexity. My favorite of the style if I’m in the mood for a high abv beer. The alcohol is well covered though, at least at this aging point. I am glad I have more and would love to taste a fresh one next to an aged one."
Bravo 2017,4.43,"Another an exceptional FW BA brew. Rich and smooth. A gentle but huge brown ale that benefits from awesome FW barreling! Rich, complex and rewarding. Caramel and chocolate with wood and vanilla. Don’t miss this one."
Bravo 2017,4.69,"Pours a cloudy, deep mahogany coloration with a medium, creamy head. Smells intoxicating of bready, caramel malt with a lovely sweet bourbon note and hints of toffee, vanilla, dark fruits and oak. Taste is a dominated by bready, caramel malt, a distinct but mellow bourbon presence and dark/red fruit: black/redcurrant, dates, fig, as well as hints of vanilla, toffee and an earthy oak note, with just a touch of licorice and peppery spice. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and some dark fruits, bourbon and toffee lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.

A fantastic Brown Ale with a lovely, mellow bourbon note that never feels boozy and a perfect balance of dark/red fruits, toffee and mild spice."
Bravo 2017,4.23,"Pours a rusty brown color with a thin khaki head. Smell has malts,dark fruit,bourbon and toffee. Taste follows nose with toffee,and dark fruit leading the way its integrated nicely with oak and bourbon . Mouth feel was very sweet with malt and caramel with detracted a bit from the barrel. Taste more like a blond barleywine than IMP. Brown. None the less a very good boxed FW brew."

Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.34,"Sweet pineapple, tropical hoppy, and hint of dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a slightly malty, tropical hoppy bitterness. This might be slightly passed it's ""drink by date"", but is still drinking nice and feels good on the palate!"
Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,4.34,"Cloudy but not quite a milkshake. Gold to amber color. Lasting head with a blanket of lace left on the glass.

Strong weedy, grassy aroma. Some pineapple and grapefruit as well.

Juicy, slightly sour pale malt start. Relatively thin bodied with an elevated carbonation level. The biting hop is closest to fresh ground pepper. Moderate aftertaste which isn't overly bitter. Well-balanced with a moderate level of complexity."
Double Trouble,3.68,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste."
Double Trouble,4.74,"My favorite IPA.
Big grapefruit up front.
Alcohol is well hidden.
A great citrusy beer."
Double Trouble,4.12,"Hazed, amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. Subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. Hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet, malty backbone. Lush aftertaste."
Double Trouble,4,"12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head, leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. Strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. Full bodied but carbonated , Strong citrus flavors, nice lasting bitterness, very tasty."
Double Trouble,4.22,10 month old bottle
Double Trouble,3.94,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip.

Pours slightly hazy dark gold with excellent smooth foamy head that lingers well for the ABV and good lacing.

The aromas are more floral than pungent, with some good earthy aromas as well. Evocative of an old school over the pond IPA, rather than a piney American. But as the brew warms, pungent resins start to bloom.

The brew has a nice balance. A solid but delicate clean malt backbone offset with an ample earthy/floral hop flavor. Hints of honey, citrus, and graham in midstream. The brew finishes with growing resin and chive and some warming booze.

The mouthfeel is actually a shade beyond medium, and grows heavier as the brew warms, but the carbonation and leaning alcohol keep things in check.

Overall, a really good DIPA that combines a lot of different hop feels. Although it gets a little all over the place and unfocused as the brew warms."
Double Trouble,4.25,"Pours amber with a 1/2 inch tan head. Moderate lacing as you go. A bit hazy.

Aroma of orange, pine, grapefruit, floral.

Strong taste of pine, grapefruit, orange, a bit of pineapple. Resiny.

Medium to full bodied, heavy carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

Outstanding. A damn good IPA."
Double Trouble,3.87,"One more drink before I hit the ""hard stuff"" for New Years...

...and what a good choice I have made. Great looking orange-yellow brew with frothy, thick head. Great lacing all the way down the pint glass. The smell was full of citrus and the mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of decent carbonation. The taste is mostly what you will find when you take in an imperial IPA and overall, it's solid enough."
Double Trouble,3.97,"From notes 7/7/13: Pours an opaque deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that leaves motes and a small webby ring of lace. Aroma is grapefruit, orange and caramel malt backed by pine and melon. Taste is intense grapefruit with notes of orange, pine resin,tropical fruits, melon and caramel. Starts sweet with bitterness entering at mid-sip and becoming predominant in the finish and aggressively so in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, creamy, silky, a little oily in the finish and slightly chewy."
Double Trouble,4.19,"Pours a cloudy copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of grapefruit and spice. Taste is sweet and boozy. Good mouth feel. Creamy, easy drinking."
Double Trouble,4.18,"Lightly hazed gold with four fingers of bone color head. Very dense lacings.
Smell is malty with grapefruit hops.
Taste is malt forward with good grapefruit pine slightly dank hops.
Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. The finish is dry and pretty balanced.
Overall a tasty dipa. Bottled 06/19/19. The hops have most likely faded a bit."
Doppelganger,4.66,"Poured on 5/7/2022 from a 16oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 4/29/2022 into a tulip glass.

A: The beer is a very hazy dark gold color, with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time."
Doppelganger,4.25,"Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a medium bodied but sticky white colored head that laces the glass on the way down. Smells of a treehouse - sweet toasted malts and then citrus and floral hop aromas to finish off the nose. The taste is sweet toasted malts, and then floral and hops finish off with a grapefruit taste. It's smooth, real silky, medium bodied, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer."
Doppelganger,4.63,Pours more like a west coast IPA with a dank nose. Surprising mild flavor with super smooth finish. This is really a nice beer and super juicy. Very good.
Doppelganger,4.22,"Pours a hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head. The nose is predominantly dank with some piney notes in the background. The flavor has notes of orange juice and grapefruit juice with a pithiness on the finish.

This offering is super juicy but while the finish is hoppy, it simply lacks the bitterness that I expect in a top-shelf DIPA. It's tasty, interesting and worth trying once but I wouldn't make it a repeat purchase."
Doppelganger,4.18,"Another heavy hitting treehouse beer. Faintly bitter, earthy dank underpinning the juicier elements."
Doppelganger,4.46,"Pours a hazy medium straw color, abundant foamy head that lasts. Huge hoppy aroma, loads of overripe mango, massive pineapple, dank guava. Some citrus as well. Remarkable. Very flavorful. Loads of ripe tropical fruits mix with pithy citrus notes. Very juicy, semi sweet with no bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall an excellent DIPA. Would buy again.

Doppelganger,4.4,"Canned 2/15/21, ""I have read a book about me reading the book I am reading"" stamped on the bottom

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together

Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick

This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!"
Doppelganger,4.58,"A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing

S: A mix of tropical fruit and citrus up front along with a dose of dank and earthy undertones

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tropical fruit and citrus, quickly followed up by the dank, herbal, and earthy tones. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and citrus

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth

O: A very good imperial version of Alter Ego that really hits with both the juicy and dank notes. Very easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out"
Doppelganger,3.98,"Pours hazy straw yellow, two fingers of head that recedes slowly with lots of lacing.

Nose is tropical citrus, lemon, mango, pineapple.

Taste follows, lemon, mango, some notes of pine/resin.

Feel is excellent, slightly creamy full bodied, good carbonation, leaves a slight sticky lingering feeling.

Overall excellent hazy IPA from Treehouse as usual"
Everett,3.63,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.

Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.

The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance."
Everett,4.4,"Canned on 10/12/21 (best before 1/12/22); consumed on 1/19/22

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.

Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.

Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium."
Everett,4.59,"Look: opaque, dark chestnut brown, bordering on black. Slightly viscous ringing when swirled; thick, tight carbonation.
Smell: lots of cocoa, coffee, toffee and brown sugar.
Taste: absolutely incredible! Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory.
Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.
Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass."
Everett,4.63,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours jet black with a good amount of light brown head that sticks around for a while. Lacing is extensive. The nose is roasted malts, black licorice, milk chocolate, some coffee grounds, and a light tobacco note. Really smooth and nice.

The taste is outstanding. Intense and complex. Dark chocolate, charred wood, malts, licorice, burnt toffee, dark roast coffee, and a bitter smoky flavor that becomes more intense on the aftertaste. Very smooth and well integrated. I really dig this one. Not surprised by the great ratings!

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. There is a nice creaminess to it. Overall, this is a fantastic porter that I'm very glad to have tried."
Everett,4.49,"Deep brown color where light will pass with a bright light. Minor beige head but it lasts. Nice ring lace.

Creamy, almost like milk, chocolate. Not very sweet though. No coffee.

Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Lower carbonation. There's a bit more bitterness than the smell suggests but it seems to come from hops not black patent malt as there's no burnt elements of coffee flavors. Rich sweet to semisweet chocolate flavor before the bitterness comes from the swallow."
Everett,4.93,"Poured from a fresh can into a tulip glass:

Appearance: really dark brown, verging on black, with mahogany lights. Thick beige head. Plenty of retention and lacing, with fairly persistent head.

Very roasty, warm and inviting with multiple layers of aroma: light milk chocolate underlain by mellow coffee.

Taste follows the nose: deep base of roasted malt, with some bitter chocolate. Coffee notes are very mellow with a hint of vanilla and hazlenut.

Medium-bodied with light carbonation and really nice mouthfeel. Quite a clean finish for a porter.with a relatively crisp finish for a porter.

Overall: Wow! A benchmark porter. The depth of flavour is incredible for a beer with no adjuncts at this ABV. Combined with lovely mouthfeel and a fantastic finish this is truly a world class porter."

Hill Farmstead Brewery
Date: 18 May 2021
I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.

Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note.

Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate.

The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness.

The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish.

One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness."
Everett,5,"A porter! Wow, I don’t think I can do this justice with my poor review. This is just, wow!"
Everett,4.38,"16 oz can, canned 7/27, poured into curved pint glass. The aroma is chocolate, roasted grains, cold brew, maybe some cocoa powder. The taste is right in line. And it’s quite tasty. The feel is medium , carbonation low and smooth. Overall, an outstanding Porter worth tracking down."

Everett,4.37,"Canned 5/18/21. Poured into a tulip at ~45 degrees. Black as night, with a wonderful, dense beige colored head with good retention and lacing Looks amazing. Aroma is rich, sweet and malty. Taste is roasted malts & unsweetened chocolate. In typical HF fashion, it 's well balanced in a nuanced way that other breweries don't always nail. Simple, yet complex. Little bit of bitterness, yet smooth. Feel is soft and creamy. Good beer."

Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap. An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown. Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head.
Lacing – Fair. Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites. See also above.
Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.
Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter."
Everett,4.52,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.05,"650 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.0%. Pitch black colour, moderate creamy tan head. Intense aroma of cocoa / chocolate. The flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa, but the sweetness is not too extreme. Also some roasted coffee notes. A moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (Chinook and Willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate, this is clearly not a beer for you."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.44,"I've had many opportunities to drink Choklat Oranj and really liked it. Had this one for a few years and thought a snowy Christmas would be a good time to drink it. Really hits the spot. I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available any longer but should it pop up again i'm definitely getting another bottle or two"
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.25,"22oz bottle. No dating information found.
Black colored body, with ruby back lit highlights. Two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. Leaves very little lacing.
Aroma is similar to a chocolate malt. Smells very sweet.
Taste is sweet but also bittersweet, and with a little smoky char. Displays many types of chocolate, from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malts are there for support.
Mouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation.
This is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.48,"Pours a brown so deep it appears to be shoe polish black. Garnet colored when bright light is passed through it. The pour produces a strong finger of foamy, moderately lasting, mocha head that leaves a rounded surface cap, a respectable collar ring and a pasty wash of lace 1/2 inch above the collar. The presentation is above average for a higher octane Imperial Stouts. Aroma is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate... deeply roasted malts, with hints of toffee, spice, prunes and a little alcohol booze. Taste is even more chocolate. Rich dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate pudding, vanilla (like Oreos and milk), something nutmeg-like and alcohol spice. Puts me in mind of a deeply chocolate eggnog (if there is such a thing). There is little alcohol booze (for the ABV) and a faint hint of dark fruit. Velvety smooth in the finish it has almost no prickle between the finish and aftertaste but the hint is there. The aftertaste is earthy, chocolate, slightly bitter, roasted and burnt. Alcohol is evident as spice, warmth, flavor and maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, smooth... velvety smooth, tongue coating creamy and chewy with a very thin peppery prickle."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.35,Tremendous
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.8,"Christmas Eve snowfall, a fireplace and Santa bringing me a case of Southern Tier Choklat. I'm set for the winter. Great velvety feel, pours almost black. But the aroma and taste are the stars here. First, they line up. None of this smells like one thing and tastes like another. The chocolate coffee balance is perfect. At 10%abv you should be sipping this beer and frankly no matter what the abv, this beer deserves to be enjoyed slowly. Alexa. Play ""The Christmas Song"" by Nat King Cole. And tell Santa to make that two cases of Choklat."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.2,"Look: It pours black with a dark brown head. Head retention is moderate.

Smell: The initial aroma is a strong deep dark chocolate aroma. It reminds me of a brownie as it warms a bit.

Taste: This has a rich malt flavor with dark chocolate and cocoa. There is some roast and some slight burnt flavors. There is a bit of cherry in the background as well. Dark fruits are very low.

Feel: It has a rich, velvet like texture that is smooth and creamy. It has a moderate amount of bitterness to it.

Overall, it is a very rich, chocolate beer. The dark chocolate is the dominate flavor of the beer with some supporting elements in the background."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.31,"A: poured from a 22 oz bottle dated 12/28/13 into a pint glass, dark brown almost black with a large tan head that lingers leaving good lacing, clear

S: huge chocolate, dark bitter chocolate, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malt, toffee, sweet vanilla

T: sweet chocolate, vanilla, milk shake, toffee, slight coffee, dark and roasted malt

M: thick and rich

O: excellent chocolate imperial stout"
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.47,"Dark black, lots of dark chocolate taste and smell, hint of vanilla. Pretty great if you like chocolate"
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.5,"As a rule, I don't drink Stouts, but my wife does and I tasted hers. This was a great beer! The main thing that got me was the taste and mouthfeel. I could taste Chocolate and Cherry with good body, and there was no lingering aftertaste that I have found with most Stouts. We were visiting in South Carolina. Wish it and their Chocolate Orange Stout was available here in Virginia."
Choklat (Blackwater Series),4.18,"This is a delicious dessert beer. Roasty coffee mixes in with a chocolate pudding sort of flavor. The beer is somewhat creamy with plenty of chocolate. Really good stuff, but a little heavy. Probably best to share or drink slowly. Not hot, just really rich."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.18,"375ml bottle into a teku. 2014 vintage.

Looks good, soft burgundy body. Small head fizzes away quite quickly, no lacing

Tart cherry aroma with a hint of oak.

On tasting, cherries much stronger than suggested by the nose. Tart without being drying, fairly sour, a touch of wood.

Mouth between medium and full, finish tart cherry, and at the very end, a light dryness comes in.

Overall, very good kriek lambic, holds up very well after 8 years."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.59,"2015 vintage. Pours a deep cherry red, light pink 0.5"" head that quickly settles out, no lacing. Nose is oak, must, wine lees, cherry and cherry wood, mild lactic notes. Much of the fruit has sapped out of this over the years - there's an initial hit of sourness at the start, but tannic oak takes over rather quickly and sticks through to the finish. What is there of the fruit registers as sour cherry (I'd also buy raspberry), but it's far in the background. Feel is great - so very smooth and drinkable, the only thing keeping me from drinking quarts of the stuff is price. Would like to have fresh version to drink alongside to see how much the fruit is meant to shine."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.03,"2011 vintage bottle. 2033 best before date so guessing this is a 2013 release.

Pours a kind of deep purple with red hues. Kind of in that Coca Cola/Dr Pepper meets Dimetapp grape vein in color. That classic musty cherry character on the nose. Even after all of this time, it's incredibly fruit forward. The cherry character is sweeter than I anticipated. Having this, I'm wanting to get some Intense Red some time soon. This has moderate levels of acidity and funk. Overall, it's pleasant to drink, but I feel like there's less lambic character than I would like."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.27,"Shared 375 ml bottle at local tasting, vintage 2011. Hazy deep red colour, moderate pink head. Lovely aroma of brettanomyces / farmhouse, sour cherries, crushed cherry kernels and almonds. Sour cherries galore in the flavour, tart finish. Classy beer."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.88,First Lambic . . . didn't really know what to expect. Not as much head as expected. Bottle was dated 2018. Beautiful red as it poured . . . not nearly as sour as we heard possible.
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.04,"A 375ml corked and caged bottle, 2018 vintage, with a best before date of 24th June 2039. Poured into a Boon stemmed glass.

Appearance: A cloudy cherry red colour, with a two fingered pinkish head that dissipated fairly quickly but settled to a thin cap, while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Cherry, oak, apple, and a touch vinous and funky.

Taste: Light sour, tart, cherry, dried cherry, vanilla, oak, funk, with some vinous notes.

Mouthfeel: Dry, light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Good cherry aroma and flavours with an interesting mix of oak, vanilla and funk."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.24,"375 mL cork & cage bottle bought at the LCBO early last year - Vintage 2016, best before Aug 26 2036 and served slightly chilled.

Pours deep burgundy, taking on more of a magenta-purple hue when held to a bright light. A deliberately rough pour produced about one finger of bubbly, light pink-tinged head that settled off within the next minute or so; a tight collar is the only surviving remnant. Its aroma is tart and somewhat vinous, including notes of red wine, oak and yeast funkiness; the cherries, for their part, come off decidedly sour vs. sweet, with hints of raspberry also coming through.

Fruity and flavourful, but not particularly tart/sour for a lambic. Cherries and raspberries dominate the forefront, with a mixture of bready, wheaty malt sweetness, grape must and oak following shortly thereafter. Hints of spiciness at the finish and lingering beyond - cherry pits come to mind - with sweet cherry pie, mild funk, oak astringency and tart cherries carrying on into the aftertaste. Medium in body, with low-ish carbonation levels that gently prickle the palate, resulting in a fairly smooth, fulfilling texture on the tongue. Absolutely no sign of that 8% whatsoever.

Final Grade: 4.24, an A-. While it's not as if I've reviewed scores of them, I will say that Boon's Kriek Mariage Parfait is one of the better krieks I've sampled over the years. Maybe marginally overrated if you're going by its very impressive BA score... but given the fact that I don't drink all that many lambics, fruited or otherwise, there's no real reason to take my word for it - try this beer for yourself if you can find it, and then report back with your own findings. I regret not picking up a second bottle while I could, because I'd like to see how this fares over the long term - I've seen some far-out expiry dates, but 20 years out from the bottling date is so ridiculous that I need to test it for myself... assuming I live that long."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.31,"2015 Best by 04/07/2037 Batch #74306

Medium dark, translucent, ruby-red, with slight pink head, that dissipates to a thin ring.

Smell is dried &/or cooked cherries, similar to pie filling, minus the sweetness. Light acetic notes , and faint tannic wood aromas. Mellows, and blends a bit as it warms.

Taste is dried,vinous cherry, some oak and leather, finishing with the barest hint of cherry+lambrusca sweetness. Some very light bitterness lingers after swallow.

Feel is light-medium, despite the 8%abv, but not watery. Some light, very,very fine carbonation hits the tongue towards finish. Just enough to let you know that it's beer, and not wine. Some just noticeable, slight warming at the back of the palate , and overall, as I get through about 8oz . The only indication that this is 8% , rather than 4%-ish.

Overall, very enjoyable. First time having this , & definitely need to get more."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.98,"2020-03-27
375ml bottle served in a little Cantillon glass. 2015 vintage.

Pours a dark ruby with a medium sized head, fairly large for the style really. Kind of murky. Lots of carbonation. Smell is oak with a hint of funk, and lots of cherry.

Taste is bitter and fruit-skinny, moderate tartness, fair amount of oak.

Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, good beer."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.11,Muted cherry flavor. Good carbonation. Pleasing dark red color.
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,3.45,"2015 bottle.

L: Pours a ruby red that is clear but very dark requiring a lot of light to see its color. Head is a dark pink with good retention.
S: Sweet cherries. Not a strong aroma.
T: Subtle cherry. Creamy sweet vanilla flavors. Not as much cherry as I would expect and not funky.
F: Medium-low body, carbonation lower than expected.

Underwhelming. The whole beer is a bit muted. The nice lambic funk is missing, the cherry flavor is a bit muted and what cherry flavor is present is not my favorite."
Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait,4.34,"A 2015 bottle.

A: Pours a dark ruby red. A nearly pink head forms and rises at about one finger. That gently fizzles out to a ring that sticks with light lace.
S: Love the dark cherry aroma here. Very aromatic and almost perfume like. Vanilla, and a touch of oak and tannins. This is very nice.
T: Like the nose, plenty of dark cherry flavors here. Even with the bottle being several years old, the tart cherry flavors seem very fresh. I always get a bit of vanilla with Kriek's for some reason, maybe the oak and maybe a mixture of the fruit itself. Though not overly sweet in anyway. Oak and tannins again. A light tartness and acidity lingers. This is great.
M/O: A medium to full body with good carbonation. I would say highly carbonated but still a good crisp bite. That becomes very smooth. Everything works well here which makes this very easy to drink. Everything is in balance and overall well done.

I love Boon Lambic's and this is an excellent example of the style. Even after several years, the fruit flavor seems incredibly fresh. This excellent balance between the tartness and acidity and the fruit and oak flavors. Highly recommended."
Parabola,4.29,"2021 variant. Good viscosity on this. Great barrel. Just something missing on the back end. The beer pours very dark, with modest head, more than I was expecting. Nice aromas of chocolate, coffee & vanilla. I'd rate this above average, but expected more based on the ratings on here. Wouldn't run out to buy this again the way I searched this one out, but would gladly drink it if I was out and it was on tap or happened to be a bottle in the cooler."
Parabola,4.68,"This beer is nearly black in color. There is a modest head that persists, and there is a little bit of lace.
Aroma of cherry, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a little booze.
Cherry taste, but taking a back seat to chocolate fudge and espresso coffee. Some vanilla in the taste, and some bourbon.
A big, slow-sipping beer."
Parabola,3,"Pours a cola colored dark amber; lighter still that one might expect. A full 2 finger frothy mocha head. Nose is roasted malts, bitter coffee, and chocolate. Taste follows suit. Not much barrel character to speak of. Overall, average. 2022 vintage."
Parabola,4.71,"Just opened a 2017 vintage.
Dark brown, almost black. So dark it absorbs the light! Thin head but maintains a lacy ring around the rim. Bourbon and coffee aromas, with flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, Bourbon, vanilla and brown sugar. Slightly oaky, but not overdone at all. Very thick and lingering finish. Good stuff."
Parabola,4.47,"2021 bottle:

Appearance: Black, thin head.

Smell: Rich, chocolatety, boozy, wood, vanilla.

Taste: Really thick and coating right away. Big vanilla barrel note that transitions to rye spiciness. Chocolatety and mild sweetness. Kind of separates into beer and barrel factions before coalescing again by the end of the glass.

Overall: Sort of a whale for me, I've been wanting to try for years and finally FW sent some to MN. Very thick stuff, tasted great then kind of had an awkward phase of “here's beer” and “here's barrel” before coming back together as a unit. Tasty stuff!"
Parabola,4.63,"A: Inky black
S: brown sugar, coffee, chocolate, oomami (soy sauce?)
T: brown sugar, coffee, chocolate
M: thick
O: well it's not a Bourbon County but it's still pretty good."
Parabola,4.68,"Picked up a few a while back - opened the first on a special occasion.

L - Nice pour, head not so thick, but hung around long enough to look nice and chewy.

S - Nothing noticeable.

T - Exquisite. Truly delicious. Deep, some sweetness, and excellent complexity of flavors. As compared to many other RIS, no bitterness at all, and not too sweet. Really great. ABV extremely well hidden.

F - As expected, smooth and easy to drink.

O - Definitely a world class beer."
Parabola,4.41,"Growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, 2022 vintage

Hooooooo boyyyyy. Parabola. Finally. We don’t see much FW here in Mass, but thankfully a trip to Philly found me at Half Time on the way back, where I ended up with this gem, as well as Perennial Abraxas! I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut

It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat

This wasn’t mind blowing by any means, but it is pretty great. I grabbed a bottle from Half Time as well to cellar. Let’s see how this is holding up in 2 years"
Parabola,4.65,"* Note: I am a beginner and this is the first beer I've loved.

Rating the 2015 bottle I just had.

L: Almost black and pretty opague. Not too foamy.
S: Chocolate, cherries, and coffee or maybe espresso
T: My best way to describe this is that it tastes like someone poured bourbon or whiskey into a glass of red wine and mixed it with a chocolate bar-- but somehow some cherries fell in. Very strong,
F: Smooth and thick like I like my women.
O: This is so boozy and sweet without actually being too sweet like wine could be. Not sure how else to describe it. I took big sips but didn't rush it. I was so happy"
Parabola,4.47,"Poured the 2015 edition and it's now 2022, so I'll try and round these scores up where it makes sense since I think this is past its peak.

L: Very dark brown (won't call it black), tiny head that recedes quickly and with little lacing.
S: Raisins, roasty, some barrel.
T: All sorts of things happening. When colder it matches the nose; as it warms you get rich dark chocolate, a little vanilla, and some booziness as well.
F: Thick, smooth, dessert-like.
O: Definitely should have opened this a couple years earlier but it's still one of the greats."
Parabola,4.42,"L: Looks almost black, small, quickly receding kh!ki head, no lacing.
S: Snot locker gets some chocolate, dark fruit, fig or date maybe a bit of coffee and some leather. Kinky.
T: This is tasty, all of the aforementioned odors, some licorice, char and cherry.
F: Smooth, creamy, not much carbonation at all.
O: This is damn tasty and it certainly takes the chill oughta' these old bones."
Parabola,4.37,"It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.

I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees."
Parabola,4.65,"2019 vintage. Wonderful aroma of figs, coffee and anise. First sip is intense flavors of bourbon, followed with strong dark chocolate, licorice, and stone fruit. Long lingering finish, you do get a bit of alcohol hotness, but that comes with the territory. A truly world-class beer."
Parabola,4.6,"12 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew. Wish I would have bought more of this when I was able to, will definitely buy more the next time I can!"

Look is great. Mouthfeel is great
Overall 5/5 . Drink fresh cuz only dimwitt would age this"
Parabola,4.59,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.

Appearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?

Smell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.

Taste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.

Mouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.

Overall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent."
Parabola,4.93,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up from liquor store for around $10-12. 2020 vintage No.11 printed on front label.

Appearance - Black opaque body with a small, brown, creamy one-finger head with decent to low retention, good lacing and stick. Head easily regenerates with a swirl. 4.75

Smell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75

Taste - Absolutely incredible. Flawless. Balanced. Bold up strong dark characters upfront but mellows out into a slow, rich, robust journey to a perfect aftertaste. 5

Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy. Warming. 5

Overall - No off characters whatsoever. 5"
Parabola,4.5,One of the very best non adjunct BA Stouts
Parabola,4.96,"There is depth to this that's pretty incredible.  I can smell licorice, bittersweet chocolate and musty whiskey barrel.

The taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor.

It has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness.

Wow, what a beer.  It's the most complex stout I've had but the flavors are never muddled; always clear.  I give it a 5.9 out of 6."
Parabola,4.51,"On tap at the brewery. Pours black with beige head. Body is full and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, sherry, dark fruit, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, alcohol, herbal hops. Long almost dry finish. Delicious brew."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.25,"Taste is really developed with cinnamon, cacao nibs, bourbon barrel, and spice from the habanero. There is almost a sour aspect that is unusual. Overall it is really nice."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,3.75,"Decent vanilla character, some oaky barrel notes, plenty of spice from the habaneros and a spicy cinnamon note that hits in just the right spot. Very good beer."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.47,This is definitely awesome and delectable. I probably can't say anything different that someone else already hasn't. Just buy a bottle if you see it
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.47,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head that quickly recedes. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.58,"Look - fantastic thick black with a tan head and lacing
Smell - chocolate vanilla spice and barrel
Taste - about the same as the smell
Feel - medium full body with medium carb
Overall - pretty tasty Mexican ba stout"
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.26,"Modest head production and retention, but it's not completely still.

Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.

Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.

Mouthfeel is adequately full and lively; I would prefer both more thickness and more activity, but it's a very drinkable beer."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.21,"Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well. Lots of chocolatey notes in this one. Some vanilla and oaky burn on the finish. It's not super sweet, but there's enough sweetness. It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.79,"12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.

S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.

T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.

F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup.

O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's. They're not exactly a slouch of a brewery."
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.9,Good stuff!
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.74,Chocolate spicy walnuts. Thick and lucious.
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,4.29,"A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.

S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.

T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.

MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.

Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest."
Sofie,4.07,"On tap at the Clybourne brewpub

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat

Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

This is a nice, well rounded Saison. Nothing to seek out but good nonetheless"
Sofie,3.98,"Fairly light with a touch of funkiness and bitterness. More bitter than I expected, but that may also be the citrus peel. Excellent aroma."
Sofie,4.02,"This is a 12oz. bottle, poured into the Goose Island pint glass. This brew is slightly hazy, a light yellow with a slight orange tint when held up to the light. There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes.
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also.
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice.
This is an easy drinker, not heavy, a medium smooth feel."
Sofie,4.14,"Pours a bronzish gold, minimal lacing. Slightly funky scent with orange background. Slightly funky, slightly tart, mildly citrus. Lighter body, especially for a barrel aged beer. Good, but light."
Sofie,3.12,"A Saison found the day after Saison Day. Better late, but unfortunately, this was the only one available. Two brown twelve ounce bottles have been emptied into a clear glass liter mug. It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee. Yet, for a once a year change, it wasn't such a terrible thing."
Sofie,4.65,"Good tasting saison, great flavor!"
Sofie,4.5,Lots of carbonation. Citrus to the nose. Orange with the funky brett flavors. Very smooth and excellent beer. My favorite saison.
Sofie,3.94,"2017 vintage from Tesco (£3):
Clear golden with a stream of fine bubbles rising to a thin, quarter centimetre head that's white & foamy, covering the surface well. It's floral, fresh & quite lively on the nose with Belgian yeast, pepper, background spices & some touches of grapes, apple & peach too. There's a slightly funky feel to it that carries of the to the taste that's dominated by a mix of apples & grapes followed by floral touches. It was quite a sharp, dry beer with a light-medium body & it was definitely more balanced than normal for a saison - a decent beer."
Sofie,3.89,"Bottle conditioned (2017). Straw colour. hazy. Frothy head. Effervescent.
Smells of silage, composting apples, spice and lemon.
Tastes similar. Stale blanc de blanc.
Provides a zingy feel. Light and refreshing."
Sofie,3.77,"Bottled and a surprise purchase from Altrincham town centre Tesco
Pours a slightly hazy golden body with thick white head
Aroma is sweet white wine
Flavour is quite like a pies porter too"
Sofie,4.13,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.

L---Bright gold color that's just a touch hazy. Pillowy white head that faded down to a ring and left good lacing.

S---Orange zest as advertised. Some yeast and I wouldn't have noticed the pepper if it wasn't advertised.

T---Strong orange presence. Some lemon and yeast.

F---Light and airy. Refreshing. Very well carbonated.

O---A fine effort from an excellent brewery. No real tartness or funkiness which I was expecting."
Sofie,3.52,I'm not a fan of this style but I am a fan of Goose Island. I should have trusted my instincts. Pours pale and chunky. Has a nice tart aroma. Tastes like week champagne. Has a nice malt finish but the beginning and middle ruin it. Hard pass.
Sofie,3.56,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the back. Served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: The bright white, one finger head stays around for a while and leaves behind a lot of lacing that covers the entire glass. It's a slightly hazy, bright gold color.

Smell: There's a slight citrus aroma first followed by some fruity bubblegum and a touch of yogurt funk in the background.

Taste: Slightly tart with some lemon and a soft flowery note right after.

Mouthfeel: Light, crisp and refreshing with high carbonation

Overall: A good enough beer that's refreshing and easy to drink. There's some complexity but not much to write home about."
Sofie,4.51,"Cloudy, gold pour with a finger width of dense, white head. Strong orange peel followed by bread dough and apricot (?) on the nose. Similar taste, but perhaps more lemon than orange peel and darker tree fruits with yeast, herbs, and cracked white pepper. Slight coating in the mouth. One of my favorite beers!"
Sofie,4.13,"765ml bottle. Label is stamped with bottling date of '22SEP17'. Label says ""DEVELOPS IN THE BOTTLE OVER 5 YEARS"".
Cloudy, straw colored body. Just a brief fizzy head upon pouring. Only a couple of spots of lacing are left behind.
Aroma is yeast esters, pepper, and orange citrus.
Taste is yeast esters, orange zest, and a touch of white wine. Overall impression from the esters is leather and hay. For spices pepper and cloves come to mind. Dry at the end with a short lived after taste.
Medium mouth feel, with effervescence. Excellent carbonation.
Very refreshing, lighter summer ale that works year round. I would think the yeast flavors will change depending upon the time in the bottom."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.09,Not my cup of tea. Nice color and a nice foam. You can smell the hops and fruitiness. But you can also smell and tast grain gins. For me is this beer to strong to taste the real flavors. Thats too bad.
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.13,"2021-11-22
750ml capped bottle served in a tulip. Date info: 20/01/2024 121616 11:41. Brought home from Spain for me by @mr-jj. Served probably a bit cold, I'll try to warm it up with my hands while I review.

Pours a somewhat hazy straw yellow with a giant fluffy head that collapses into a large, crunchy-looking mountain of head, right in the center, with some gorgeously webby lacing along the sides. Smell is hay, a little funk, a little spice, definite yeast aroma, surprisingly not getting much of a banana or clove, though the spice might be leaning in the clove direction.

Taste is very slightly banana-fruity, very mildly spicy. As it warms up, I get a bit more banana and more of an earthy flavor. There's a bit of bitterness to it, which I have a hard time pinning down -- more nutty than green, but not quite nutty. Maybe it'll come to me (closest I can get is almost a bark flavor?). Clove is definitely getting clearer.

Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and dry and clean. Overall, this is a very nice tripel."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.35,"750ml bottle. Label is stamped for production date of '07/13/21'.
Clear, straw colored body. Big show of uprising bubbles. Voluminous head, which takes a few small pours to fill the glass. Leaves clumps of lacing.
Aroma of banana esters, with a touch of cloves. Sweet honey and peach fruit. Also apricot.
Taste is even more expressive than the smell. Big bready malts, banana esters, and pear, peach, and apricot fruit. This is both sweet and slightly bitter. Dry in the aftertaste, with the yeast, malts, and fruit.
Dry and slightly tart mouth feel. Each sip is quick and to the point. High level of carbonation, with beautiful billowing heads.
So nuanced and very expressive at the same time. High mark for the style. Higher ABV% is well hidden, but results in a warming experience. The chore to drinking this beer is the waiting for the head of each pour to subside."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.49,"On tap at The Sovereign in Washington DC.

This one pours a hazy golden yellow color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like pear, honey, stone fruit, banana esters, and clove.

I'm really beginning to like tripels more with time. This is an excellent version, one of the best that I've had. There's a nice doughy sweetness, with some clovey and grassy bitterness. There's a lot of dried fruit character - banana, pear, peach, etc.

This is medium bodied, pretty creamy, with a very well hidden alcohol character. It's quite drinkable,

This is as good as it gets for this style. This is tremendous."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.5,"750 ml corked and wired bottle, from Vinmonopolet. ABV is 9.0%. Very pale yellow colour, huge white head. Strong fruity, yeasty and spicy (cloves a.o.) aroma. The flavour is spicy with some fruit and white kandij sugar, but the sweetness is nearly too much. Still a good beer, but if it is worth the high price in Norway is debatable."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.2,"Gold body, hazy and unfiltered, with a marshmallow white head, thick and with excellent retention.
Aromas of banana bread, floral yeast spice, crisp sweet apple,
The taste brings to mind a dry vermouth, dry white wine, sourdough bread. Beautifully blended, it's difficult to recognize distinct flavours. Getting some white grape, floral notes, fresh bread, a dash of pear, a dust of mustiness. Fantastic feel, dry with a fine, medium-light effervescence, and warming alcohol heat providing additional balance. Flavour is clean and pure, like spring water. Well balanced, the hop bitterness is doing it's thing, hard to detect."

Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.1,"Good triple. Not as good as others, but above average. Smooth and balanced beer with fresh yeast, citrus, mandarine and hints of black pepper. Medium body with medium carbonation. Gets worse once developed from temperature."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.97,"Aroma- subtle, delicate, lightly sweet

Flavor - firm pils malt sweetness, medium intensity flowery noble hops on the mid-palalte, dry spicy finish, pear notes, warm vanilla tone, very little bitterness

MF- medium bodied and velvety, really wonderful and very balanced without any heat, bitterness, or excessive dryness"
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.82,"Looks golden with a large two finger head, smells sweet and spicy, made me excited to taste it... Strong alcohol taste but sweet and a full mouth feel, tingles the sides of tongue because of a lot of carbonation. I would give it 4.8 out of 5! Great beer, nice to sip on the Cancun beach!"
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.8,"This nails the genre. Judging by the fact I picked up four for a fiver, it had been on the rack a while, so YMMV. It pours cloudy with a tall and persistent head. There is grass and spice in the nose, corresponding to hay, spice, and floral notes in the taste. The mouthfeel is full and round, with the sharp carbonation acting as an excellent countervailing force. The only detracting element is the aftertaste, which can make for a slightly astringent and vaguely stale bitterness, albeit short-lived. Again, though, my samples may be long in the tooth."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.41,"330ml bottle from Beerhawk.com (£3.39):
Bright golden & clear with a 3cm white head that's thick & foamy looking, leaving some lacing on the sides. Fresh & spicy with yeast & a little sweetness on the nose, banana, grassy hops & pepper follow. It's more fruity tasting with peach & apricot, a touch of spice & the grassy hops from the nose too. It's well-carbonated throughout & effervescent with a light body & a dry, spicy finish that rounds things off nicely."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.07,"L- Pale amber, almost clear (minor sediment left in bottle), pours with 1Cm off-white head. (ps. holds well/forms lacing).
S- Woody and leathery.
T- Woody, almost like conifers, into dry but pungent brightness on the palate. Once my palate has adjusted to that I begin to notice the gentle spicing which becomes more prominent as the beer warms a touch.
F- The dry/bright aspects do a thorough job part-masking the 9% ABV. Usually I'd expect a 9% Tripel to be rich/robust/punchy, this seems more subtle. It has major presence just the hefty 9% is discreet.
O- Superb, nothing 'wrong/out of balance' to note. In my view it's on the dryer side of the spectrum of Tripels.
Bought from Beerhawk/UK. 330ml bottle (lable now mostly cream with gold lettering). BB: 28/05/2022"
Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.75,"L: Quite clear golden color, one finger white head, messy lacing, no carbonation.

S: Hops, yeast, sweet.

T: Hops, yeast, LOTS of alcohol, malts.

F: Medium to full bodied, lots of yeast flavor. Unfortunately, alcohol covers all the rest.

O: Decent beer to have on a cold winter day I guess but nothing I will look for again."
Gouden Carolus Tripel,3.85,"Draft at Bittercreek. Somehow missed this during my time in Europe. Light milky yellow body with a big whiff of Belgian yeast. Taste is yeast, butter, herbal hops. Medium weight and a bit of a bitter finish. Classic"
Gouden Carolus Tripel,4.18,"I believe this was bottled in 2017

Appearance - cloudy orange color with white head

Smell - malt, ginger, coriander, clove,orange

Taste - Malt, Orange, ginger, clove, tangerine, coriander

Overall - this was a tripel that I enjoyed, they orange flavor really came through while being in harmony with the other flavors. Recommended for lovers of the style

Price Point - $4.99/11.2 oz single"
Blind Pig,4.83,Stellar example of a modern west coast IPA from one of California's premier breweries. Every time I have one of these I am reminded of why this is my favorite style of beer.
Blind Pig,4.06,"This is a very well balanced IPA. It showcases its hop’s like all IPAs do. Both the West Coast Pine notes and East Coast Citrus are present in your first and last sip. It hides its > 6% ABV well, making the drinker believe that it is sessionable."
Blind Pig,4.46,"510 ml (1 pint, 1.25 ounce) bottle, bottled on 06/10/22. Served in a Spiegelau IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stuck around for a very long time. Lots of lacing, too. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like grapefruit, orange, pine, bready malt and some floralness. I think the taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but with a little more kick and the addition of some citrus peel, grassy and earthy flavors. Nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. I wish more IPA's were like Blind Pig, I'd buy this quite a bit if I could get it around here. Thanks to one of my Instagram buddies for sending me this, it was a great surprise!"
Blind Pig,4.3,"Well. Tried this today after two days of drinking Pliny’s.
Not as nice, but still very good. Different.
Golden to orange look. Nice white foamy head with good lacing.
Aroma is citrus and pine-maybe woody like the label says.
I taste the pine, the citrus and the hops. None of those tastes overpowering though. Very astringent mouthfeel but with a decent amount of carbonation.
Overall very nice. Probably not as nice as Pliny, but still very good. Happy I tried it. I’ll have another."
Blind Pig,4.19,"On tap at Monk’s in Philadelphia. A very nice west coast IPA, but not the best by any means. Great lacing. Very dry with a herbal hoppiness."
Blind Pig,4.23,"Russian River Blind Pig IPA, 6.25% ABV. Pours clear golden, with a 4+ finger off-white head that left lots of foamy lacing. Nose is citrus and fruit. Taste is piney with fruit, quite bitter. Decent mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall excellent to outstanding-adjacent."
Blind Pig,4.02,"draught
Medium amber with a bit of orange overtones, for the look. Fairly light, mixed citrus peel, off-dry, lightly roasted, caramelized malts. Medium amounts of grapefruit peel and medium light toasted caramelized malts, with both trailing off fairly quickly, in a not heavy bite manner."
Blind Pig,4,"Had a Blind Pig on draft at Monk’s Cafe on 5/05/2022.

S - Smells floral and grassy
T - Tastes malty and hoppy.
F - Medium body and carbonation.
O - Nice West Coast IPA."
Blind Pig,4.06,"First timer on Blind Pig. My only complaint is that there is a piney aftertaste that, for me, hung in my mouth longer than I was OK with. I would certainly buy another one but with a full knowledge that there was a lingering aftertaste. I would have loved to have tried it on draft but I was just in SF for a few hours from a cruise and was just happy to get one Blind Pig and 3 Pliny’s."
Blind Pig,4.56,"Brief Review:

O: First time trying Blind Pig, this beer has been around a while. Despite the West Coast IPA being out of style, this one isn’t too bad. Very light and drinkable, dry finish. Almost sessionable in a way. I’ve definitely had similar beers along the way, but it’s nice to have an OG this tasty.

Recommendation: Easy to get if you’re ever on the West Coast, it’s definitely a must-try if you’re out there."
Blind Pig,3.28,Beautiful to look at and smell but the flavors in the nose aren't in the taste. Hoppiness too overpowering to enjoy. There are more sophisticated IPAs to be had.
Blind Pig,4.53,"Canned Feb 21 2022, enjoyed Mar 20, 2022. So about a month old. Received from @JayORear in an LIF from NBW BIF #14.
Poured honey color amber and quite transparent, capped with a short near white head and active carbonation continues throughout.
The aroma was mild for me; but my nose id damaged from chemical foolishness (Really, when a liquid recommends that you use a respirator when using it, USE a frickin' respirator!)
The taste was a surprise. Russian River IPA, WC all the way, right? It's like they took a page from Bell's Two Hearted and balanced the malts in with the hops. That piney dominance I expected wasn't there, but it existed in harmony with other flavors; floral, doughy, herbal, etc. Not what i expected but still really tasty.
The feel? With the active carbonation, this checked all the boxes in the regards to feel.
OA, one I've been wanting to try a long time and finally got the chance. It's not what I expected but it's really good in an unexpected way."
Blind Pig,4.01,"Pours a clear darker gold beautiful creamy dense white head, great lacing and retention.

Aroma is grassy hops, grapefruit and orange, and peach candies.

Blind Pig,4.35,Pint at Toronado in SF. Stellar IPA.
Blind Pig,4.92,"The Pig, bottled 122321, pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a thick dense head and BIG bubbles of carbonation. If there's a better smelling American IPA, I haven't smelled it yet. Floral and fruity it smells awesome. Tastes fabulous. Floral and fruity, slightly citrus the hops are perfection. WOW! So impressive. Mouthfeel is perfection. The lingering hop bitterness is absolutely righteous. Overall this is what IPA dreams are made of. The hops are just extraordinary in this wonderful blend. I may have to upgrade my Overall opinion when I have my second beer. ""...and the crowd cried for more."" My Extreme Thanks to @RaulMondesi for sharing."
Blind Pig,4.04,"Bottle from Whole Foods in Del Monte Center, Monterey, CA. Pours a clear light gold with a finger of rocky white head that sticks around, decent lacing, smell is candied citrus, mild pine resin, soft caramel, doughy brioche, taste is citrusy orange soda, pulpy orange juice, pine, mildly bitter herbal pine and citrus pith on the finish that lingers, feel is medium bodied, crisp carbonation, medium carbonic bite. An excellent balanced IPA with nice malt and bitter hop balance, a citrus and pine treat."
Blind Pig,4.49,Very bright and citrusy nose with a slight pine. Very nice bite with a quick hit of pine and ending with a citrusy bitterness. Kinda the opposite of Pliny which I found to be more pine dank aftertaste. Its definitely the younger brother of pliny but its still amazing. Definitely has the same elements in it just not as much. Would definitely buy again.
Blind Pig,4.29,"Drank 16 days after “bottled on” date. Piney, citrus aroma. Pours straw color with thick lacy white head. Flavor follows aroma, dry, piney, citrus bitter."
Blind Pig,4.85,"My new rating after losing my old profile f/10+ yrs ago. The Pig has lost its piney, citrus flavor. Its my go to beer regardless but it has lost that pig flavor."

Thanks to Donald for this surprise box!

Mostly clear gold but with a little chill haze, and a classic west coast head; bone white at 2 fingers, leaving gorgeous lace destroying the glass as it recedes gradually.

Aroma brings forward slight papery oxidation, with slight onion skin, dusty pine flooring, grapefruit rind, and dead hop leaves. I do not detect any yeast, malt, or ethanol in this beer. It is cutting and dirty and bitter smelling. It's a change from what I'm used to, but also brings me back to when IPAs were all emulating the giants like RR.

Flavor doesn't hit until about mid-palate. When that happens it brings sawdust first, then a little evergreen, then some onion skin, a tiny presence of crisp caramel malt, and then some papery oxidation. After you swallow it however, the flavor really shines. It sticks to your tongue and cheeks and roof, and sucks all moisture out. Then, seemingly suddenly, a wave of resiny bitterness and sweet honey take over and the oils take hold, pounding your palate with lupulin gland again and again. The finish is literally 10x as long as the beer itself, and takes time to dry on your palate. Then a whole new world opens up.

Feel is resiny, oily, very carbonated, with no alcohol anywhere in sight. Palate punisher, this one, as the oils destroy and scrub every taste bud from your mouth.

Overall, an impressive one to be sure, and it's easy to write paragraphs about it. This is one that should be in the books (and probably is), right along side its cousin Pliny, and has every right to be studied and emulated. This is a true west coast IPA in every sense of the word.

Exemplary."
Blind Pig,3.97,"Looks literally exactly the same as Pliny the Elder (had them side by side): beautiful, crystal-clear, light-amber-gold, with a big and pillowy head of bright white bubbles. Lots of splotches and streaks of lacing down the glass. Great looking beer. After that, the experience is very much like a muted and somewhat watered-down Pliny — some nice notes and well-crafted, but not really a standout. Piney, bright, citrusy, with solid bitterness, a lot of grassiness, some soapiness, and a touch of malt-sweetness. West Coast IPA all the way, with heavy grapefruit, but boarding on APA (for me) in terms of aroma and taste profile.

Crisp and refreshing but not particularly noteworthy."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.85,"pretty solid winter warmer. was spicy and grainy and definitely a warmer. was the highlight of the holiday variety pack for sure, but still a middle ground warmer. if you're looking for a solid sipper, it checks the boxes, but isn't a high caliber warmer or worth the purchase of the pack on it's own merits. shame there's only two in the box, but also, don't believe i'd sit and sip this one past 2-3 anyhow."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.51,"Old Fezziwig is among my favorite Sam Adams beers. There is a lot of flavor going on. It's simply delicious. That's saying a lot for a guy who loves German beers & not many American beers. But this beer, a spiced ale, has an abundance of malt flavor & spicy notes along with many of the darker notes of a German dunkel, like a bit of caramel & some of the lighter notes of a porter. This is a great beer."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,1.83,There are much better winter warmer beers out there. The look is unappealing - just dark with no sparkle. The taste is all malt and there is little spice character and the aftertaste is medicinal. Spend the extra money on a better beer.
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.78,"Clear deep reddish-amber, with about 1/2"" of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring and surface sheet of foam.

Smell is toffee, caramel, light biscuity malt, and hints of nuts and (moist) dried fruit. The overall aroma is good, but quite light.

Taste is mostly a light mix of toffee, caramel, raisin, and cooked nuts, with brief flashes of orange rind, clove and, nutmeg, finishing with a general light spiciness (coriander & black pepper) that lingers a bit.

Feel is medium, barely-slick, with moderate, moderately-bitey , fine carbonation.

Winter warmers are not among my favorites - more of a once-in-awhile-in-the-right-mood thing - but I'd put this among the top echelon of those. I used to get a 6er or 2, when you could do that, but at this moment, the 2 in the 12pk is plenty. Good while it lasts, but that's plenty enough. :)"
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,5,"Fantastic holiday beer. It has a slightly spicy gingerbread smell, but not overpowering. It has a light malt flavor up front with mild but noticeable hop flavor and finishes with a nice sweet aftertaste. It is not so thick or syrupy as you might expect, the mouthfeel is about like a normal brown or amber ale. All in all, I am very happy with the balance. It is a winter warmer without being overdone and it is super smooth and easy to drink. It certainly lives up to its reputation as a fine holiday beer."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.85,"Dark mahogany with amber and a short off-white head that quickly dissolves into a ring

Faint toffee and caramel aromas with a hint of fruitcake

Toffee, caramel, molasses, date, and fig with a little raisin with very mild ginger, nutmeg, and clove

A little thin with a fuzzy carbonation on the tongue and a mild peppery bitterness

Not great, but still pretty good. Not as rich and heavy as most winter warmers, but the flavors are well blended and it is easy to drink. I wouldn't go out of my way to find Fezziwig, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down."

Overall - Not huge on flavor, but it's pleasant and easy to drink."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.94,"From a 12oz bottle dated ""Enjoy before"" April 2022 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent very dark reddish brown with about two fingers of tan head. Decent retention, great lacing.

The smell doesn't really let loose until the beer warms a bit. Getting some nice spices-cinnamon, nutmeg. A little caramel and dried tart fruits.

Taste follows the nose almost identically. Cinnamon and nutmeg dominate.

Quite smooth drinking. Mild cinnamon aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Spiced beers really aren't my thing, but this one is really well done and I'd drink again."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.72,"Pours dark brown. Decent head that hangs a bit.
Smell some baking spices and a little malt.
Flavor follows. Nothing is overpowering. Somewhat Aquius for the look of it. Nothing is overbearing. Easy to drink.
Dry finish. A little astringent. Keeps ya coming back.
Good beer. Nothing special"
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.61,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. A healthy beige head leaves plenty of lacing. Color is brown. Aroma is fairly mild, some spice and malt notes. Mouthfeel is medium and frothy with a somewhat dry finish. Flavors of toffee, caramel, cinnamon, and raisin. Overall: very good but quite sweet. Definitely not sessionable."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.22,"The star of the holiday variety pack! I really wish it actually had a little fruitier flavor. Light malt, yes light malt, slightly fruity. Idk why but it tastes slightly plastic like. They smell is fantastic. I wish I liked the flavor more but to me it needs to be stronger. Not in the bitter sense, but the fruit I guess. For such an iconic holiday brew the flavor needs to set itself apart more. I'll grab one of the two in the box, but in a six pack? Nah. Holiday nostalgia"
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.81,"12oz bottle. Label is notched to indicate best before April of 2021.
Deep amber colored body. Thin finger of off white head, further recedes to a partial cap. Leaves some bands of lacing on the non-drinking side.
Aroma of dark malts with toffee. Also expresses spices of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.
Taste is a mix of the dark roasted malts and the spices. Has toffee from the malts. Has spices of black pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. All quite subtle, but the aftertaste brings the spices into the nose.
A little thinner than medium mouth feel. Very little sweetness nor bitterness. Mostly a savory presentation. Good carbonation.
Good beer to sip during the colder months. Not bold in smell nor flavor, but pleasant enough as an alternative to a basic porter or if a truly spiced holiday ale is too much."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,3.81,"L: Ruby brown body, pretty light head.
S: Rich caramel malt, sweet, slightly alcoholic, notes of cinnamon and allspice, a bit of cherry.
T: Some dark fruit- plum and cherry, sweet caramel, citrus notes, hints of spice, and a bready finish.
F: Very crips, high carbonation, lightly syrupy.
O: Tastes like the big brother to their winter lager. I dig the dark fruit and caramel, though there isn’t as much spice present in the body as I had hoped. Still, really enjoyable."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4.5,"It's back! 11/5/2021

L: Very red, with some brown.
S: Up the nostril, took in some heavy gingerbread, spice, I wish I knew my spices better, nutmeg? Even some sweetness.
T: Unique spice taste. Clove, molasses gives way into spice, then ends with a bit of a bitter tinge to them at the end, not really a light metallic, have a feeling it's the spices. Followed by a sweet malty and bitter aftertaste.
F: Good carbonation. Not watery at all in my opinion, no sticky mouth feel. Not sure what this other guy was talking about unless he heated his up haha."
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,4,"A rich, spicy, and wonderfully complex Christmas ale."
Lagerbier Hell,4.33,"Usually the first sip is decisive and this beer made me shout whoa! out loud - it was unexpectedly hoppy! It also has a remarkable flavor too, it is not “just” another lager. I’m getting some saltiness from it too? or am I just making that up? Anyhow it feels great and tastes exceptional, especially with its own unique flavor, not too overwhelming, just right. It looks and smells great too, the ownly thing I didn’t like about it is that I only bought one bottle… This could be - wait, let me say this SHOULD be - a regular!"
Lagerbier Hell,5,Favourite. Less bitter than pilsner. Typical Munich in the best way. Enjoyed it from both bottle and tap. Delicious.
Lagerbier Hell,3.78,"drank straight from the bottle at 'The Font' Bar in Manchester City centre after an impromptu homebrew meet & before The Alarm played the nearby Ritz
Just the Malty slightly spiced hop beverage I needed to refresh me"
Lagerbier Hell,3.65,Untappd backlog.
Lagerbier Hell,4.43,"Pours a gorgeous crystal clear yellow with thick, fluffy head.

Smell is bready and crackery with some floral hints. Notes of citrus, lavender and rye.

Taste is bready, very clean and crisp with a solid bitterness. Notes of citrus, rye, knäckebröd and some floral hints. Very easy to drink.

Moutheel is medium, a bit creamy and well carbonated.

Overall, a terrific Helles, light and drinkable."
Lagerbier Hell,4.12,"The first beer I ever had when I visited Munich for the first time, offered to me by my host. This is my gold standard for other German Helles beers and single-handedly reassured me I made the right decision to fly to Munich."
Lagerbier Hell,4,"Had in Frankfurt from a bottle. Tasted a little yeasty/funkier than I was expecting, but really enjoyable and light."
Lagerbier Hell,3.08,"500 ml bottle, from Seven Cellars. ABV is 5.2%. The crowncap had leaked a little during shipping, but most of the content and carbonation was intact. Crystal clear and very pale yellow colour, large white head. Nice sweetish aroma of malts and floral hops. Floral and herbal hops in the flavour, on a background of medium sweet malts. Low bitterness."
Lagerbier Hell,3.47,"Having lived in berlin for a bit more than 2 years, I have tried most of the beers sold here, pilsner, helles, weissbier, etc.. Comparing with the other helles, I would say it is good.. the biggest flavor i can extract is bitterness. It doesnt feel refreshening between 5 and 10C for instance. It doesnt have the same flavor than a weissbier, nor the lightness of a pilsner.. My biggest grudge is against the style of the beer. But feel free to try it.."
Lagerbier Hell,4.69,"Look: clear golden color with a medium white head

Smell: hops and grass, very clean smell

Taste: nice crisp flavor, a little bit of hops, a little bit of malt

Feel: smooth with lit bubbles

An exemplary helles, though I generally prefer darker and stronger German beers"
Lagerbier Hell,4.04,"500ml bottle.
L: Clear, gold colour with streams of bubbles. The long-lasting, foaming, white head leaves rings of lacing.
S: Faint grain. Very clean.
T: Fresh, herbal, grassy, semi-sweet.
F: Medium/light body, light carbonation, oily mouthfeel, dry finish.
O: On-the-money helles. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. A whole world away from the cheap, industrial lagers poured in UK pubs."
Lagerbier Hell,4.66,"Two finger head, translucent light, light hay colour body, about the lightest colour on the scale. Smells of herbs, grass Taste follows the colour in that it is very light and well balanced a malty opening and subtle hop bittering, taste of flour, and lemonade. No off tastes. Goes down like a bomb.

Nothing better than this to relax on a hot day or after physical exertion."
Lagerbier Hell,3.87,"L4.25 Classic pilsner colour, good head, well retained.
S3.5 Standard
T4 pretty routine lager (not seeing much difference v pilsner), but a bit more flavour than normal. Maybe it's the epic bottle illiciting some nostalga, but I am back in munich when I drink this.
F3.75 Good carbonation, I would like a bit more body even from a pilsner.
O4 Not hugely different from most other lagers, but nice that they are still an independent brewery and if you are going to drink a pilsner, at least go for one with some authenticity."
Lagerbier Hell,4.67,"This beer poured well into a glass with a 2 finger head and the taste was amazing it was bought in Zurich Switzerland nice fresh taste and easy drinking beer
Cheers"
Lagerbier Hell,4.6,"Look: It is of golden colour, looks, when you pour it into the glass, a bit foamy. Some fizzyness can be seen.
Smell: Smells like fresh cut grass.
Taste: At first, there is a little bit of fruitiness as well as sweetness. Afterwards, you can taste the malt- though in this case it is very clear and crisp. You can taste the hops, but very subtle.
Feel: A very smooth beer, which feels very pleasant in the mouth.
Overall: A very good Helles, having a very unique taste. If you look for the ""typical"" German Helles, you are not wrong trying this one."
Lagerbier Hell,4.45,"Pours a pale golden coloration with a medium, fluffy head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy, slightly grainy malt and floral, grassy hops, with just a hint of hay. Taste is a great balance of doughy, grainy malt and floral, grassy hops, with lighter herbal accents and just a hint of hay and citrus. Finishes quite crisp and dry, with a medium bitterness and some grainy malt and floral, grassy hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

Quite a nice Helles that's quite crisp and clean, with a great balance of doughy, grainy malt and floral, grassy hops, sweetness and bitterness, while even managing a decent complexity for the style, with some herbal accents and hints of citrus and hay. It's certainly supremely drinkable and refreshing and probably the best example of the style, that has become my standard go-to."
Guinness Draught,4.05,"smooth, a little creamy but still bright. medium bitterness."
Guinness Draught,4.34,From tap at irish pub in Nördlingen in Germany. Smells like Caramel Coffee. Perfectly balanced taste. Drinks like water. Carbonation makes for a very creamy amazing mouthfeel. From tap is significantly better than Guinness from a can.
Guinness Draught,3.8,"I mean, it’s a Guinness. Best beer ever for cooking. 20 of these and a glass of milk and you have your RDA for all essential calories and nutrients. Irish car bomb anyone? Totally amazing."
Guinness Draught,4.23,"I've had Guinness before but this is the first rst time trying a Draught. I poured this one into a beer mug. Produced a good head, the feel of it was smooth, and the taste was pretty darn good. I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, a good beer and one I will come back to."
Guinness Draught,4.2,"Many places

Greatest beer ever.

Gex."
Guinness Draught,2.54,"L: jet black I sadly got a thin head great cap that never faded but thin
S: could t really pick up a scent
T: small toffee/coffee flavor nothing to crazy though
F: very thin surprising how thin it was had absolutely no body what so ever, water has more thickness
O: thin low flavor nothing crazy"
Guinness Draught,4.56,"The legendary Guinness Draught; What a fantastic debut beer review.

Third beer of the day; one Belgian white and a Guinness. I will never review a beer if it's the first of the day.

Cool 16oz glass. I cracked the burnished gold tab and let the nitrogen/co2 slowly hiss out.

After pouring, there's a bit of fireworks in the glass, let them play it up. 100% fantastic head, moist as the freshest bread. Surface tension keeps it from bubbling over the glass edge, even as it rises above. The perfect pour every time.

Time for the first sip; Not my first rodeo with Guinness, I dive right in. Caramelly toast waft as this signature black beer cuts through the soft foamy head. Great mouthfeel as the cold rush of stout emulsifies with the head. Sweet chocolate and bitter malt on the tongue. As smooth as nice whisky. The first sip of Guinness is one of the best, 5/5.

Midway there's a bit of Irish bog to traverse, as while this isn't the thickest stout it's vast and muddy nonetheless. But the nice chocolaty bread really shines through even as it warms.

The last few sips are a bitter-tooth brew eater's paradise. As I finish the beer, residual head and newly sloshed foam splatter the glass artfully. The taste of malt on the last sip radiates out to fill your nose up playfully. Even with its mild 4.2% ABV, the bitterness gives me a bit of a woozy headspace.

As I grab another Guinness to fill my empty glass, I note the almost cakelike foam at the bottom. Scrumptiously bitter, yet may negate that aforementioned surface tension. Gotta get a fresh glass!"
Rare Scooop,4.74,"Bottle pour into Cycle tulip. Opaque black. Looks viscous and syrupy.

Aromas of strawberry and chocolate are abundant. Subtle vanilla. Smells amazing with all the strawberry.

Taste is that of the aroma. Lots of strawberry through and through. Chocolate mixes in with a light lingering vanilla finish. Really damn good.

Feel is what I anticipated. Thick and viscous. Mouth coating and lingering.

Overall, this beer is pretty amazing. All the flavors I'd expect from the adjuncts."
Rare Scooop,4.66,"Great strawberry flavor complimented by standard vanilla and chocolate notes. Average barrel treatment, good mouthfeel. Overall, a fairly nice adjunct bomb."
Rare Scooop,4.7,"Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry when it warms. Delicious!"
Rare Scooop,4.87,Pours jet black with no head on top. Smell comes off as sugary sweetness with hints of chocolate. Chocolate overpowers the taste with hints of strawberry.
Juicy,4.47,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine."
Juicy,4.38,New Zealand inspired beer - aged in wine barrels for 8 months and is fruity and a darker color. Tasted of wine and some sharpness as well in this beer.
Juicy,4.61,"Alan, thank you so much for this one.

2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.

Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...

Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony."
Juicy,4.22,Tart and fruity with a lot of farmhouse funk
Juicy,4.02,Smell was gorgeous. Taste...not so much. Really didn’t vibe with my palate. Sour hops
Juicy,4.51,"Bottle courtesy of chesco.
February 2020 bottle (~10 months old).
L: Golden hazy deep orange/copper. Reddish hue. Thick fluffy average size off-white head with lacing.
S: Brett, oak, citrus, wine, time.
T: Tart, lemon, wine, oak/vanilla, with a little brett Barn funk. As expected, more flavors keep showing up as it warms up.
F: fairly full yet dry.
Overall: Very nice. Not mind-boggling. I have no knowledge of wine either."
Juicy,4.32,"L: Crystal clear light Amber with a thin head, very little retention, and no lacing.

S: Light aroma, notes of white wine, oak, peach, pear and subtle biscuit malt.

T: Intense, tart, and juicy notes of grape, peach, pear, and grapeskin. Subtle oak and bisciut malt as well as some funk.

F: Medium light body, gentle carb, dry finish.

Overall: A delicious farmhouse ale, very complex fruity flavors balanced against Earthy, oaky funk. Highly recommend."

Bottle to snifter. Share with DC.

Look: swirling foamy eggshell head. Excellent retention.


Aroma: Chardonnay, perfume, floral, very pungent aroma.

Taste: ginger ale, white grape, ester, ash

Feel: Dry finish. Medium body and excellent carbonation.

Very excellent and unique. Changes as you sip. Each attribute seems to add to the whole in unexpected ways. Kind of like a wine spritzer.

**"
Juicy,4.35,"375ml undated bottle from the most recent release.

Pours hazy copper with a half inch head of white with a vigorous pour. Minimal retention or lacing. Surprisingly low carbonation for the style. Light notes of cider vinegar, grape must, wine barrel, and wet hay in the nose. Light bodied with a slickish, thinnish mouthfeel. Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.

Nice beer but proper carbonation for the style would really help the aromatics and mouthfeel. Not really getting a ""juicy"" impression either."
Juicy,4.56,"Poured from a bottle (06Jun2019) into a Belgian glass

L: pours a perfectly clear gold/amber with a moderate white head that fades after a couple minutes. Leaves a great ring of foam around the edge with some moderate lacing

S: lives to its name with the first whiff, really gorgeous and deep tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Followed behind by a mild tart/barnyard funk and great depth from the wine barrel aging. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, some apricot, orange, pleasant acidity

T: follows the nose well, fruit nose comes through but takes a backseat to the base ale. Slightly funky, nicely tart farmhouse flavor with some notable wine barrel structure and depth. Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish

F: light+/medium- body, medium/medium+ carbonation, slightly drying, moderate acidity

O: a delicious farmhouse ale (no surprise there) with a really great and differentiated nose. Up against stiff competition with the rest of the HF line-up, manages to differentiate itself well"
Juicy,4.59,Bottled on 02/14/2020. Enjoyed on 09/24/2020.
Juicy,4.55,"Got curbside service last week, Freekin’ Covid. Sucks being 100 feet away from tap room and not getting in! Oh well, got to be happy it’s even doing curbside. I just wanted to try this when I was looking at potential beers and am super happy I did. I really like sours and while this isn’t a sour the Juicy was, for me, close. But this didn’t overwhelm me with tart at all. Just a great blend and very easy going down. I know it’s not a sour but if it was it would be my favorite of all that I have had. Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer. Kind of wish I had purchased a couple more than just my two. Would have loved it in a 750 ml bottle though. Just not enough of it."
Juicy,4.31,"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep orangey/amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with light retention and some lacing. Aroma of funky yeast notes with some vinous notes of Sauvignon and some oak presence is also detectable. Taste is also a mix of funky yeast notes with some vinous notes with clear Sauvignon notes, some oak and light tartness with no acidic notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very enjoyable sour with nice wine barrel-aging notes."
Dragon's Milk,4.73,Smooth to drink perfect balance. Rich oak flavor and I wasn't expecting the after taste. Great beer for sure.
Dragon's Milk,4.72,"Look: Pitch black, little head

Smell: Oak, wood, chocolate

Taste: Sweet, chocolate with a late taste of coffee. Absolutely amazing

Feel: Nice, very nice after taste too.

This is an excellent beer!"
Dragon's Milk,4.28,"12 oz. bottle, 5 months old. Black on black look, poured in a snifter. Dark tan head which rapidly dissipates. Aroma is bourbonesque.
Tastes of chocolates, cherries, coffee, and of course bourbon. Feel left my mouth with a slight dryness, of course your mouth is different. This is absolutely one excellent sipper, I’m thanking myself for this outstanding purchase. Will buy again. Highly recommended."
Dragon's Milk,4,"First base Dragon's Milk I've had in years, since it was available at my local for $2 a bottle. Aroma and taste, barrel, vanilla. Smooth, strong, satisfying and totally worth the $6 paid today for 3, yes 3. How's that possible? Guess I'm just lucky, occasionally. I did love the 2021 Double Vanilla Reserve, the xtra vanilla and 3 months barrel aging was worth the $19. I like this beer, but would not pay the $19 for 4."
Dragon's Milk,4.37,Outstanding!
Dragon's Milk,4.83,Great!!
Dragon's Milk,4.5,A rich and smooth stout that’s definitely worth the hype. The 11% abv is noticeable on the finish and gives a pleasant warmth to this complex sipper.
Dragon's Milk,4.83,"Look: Jet black extremely dark pour, light foam rising to top if any.
Smell: Chocolate was the first thought along with a lot of roasted malts and a subtle hint of a coffee smell to follow at the end.
Taste: Definitely taste the chocolate.. Wow I'm extremely impressed. You taste the chocolate along with a hint of caramel mixed with a whiskey/ bourbon taste too. Very good combo.
Feel: Very smooth taste, very little carbonation.
Overall: I definitely would buy this 4 pack again and it's definitely worth the $15-$20 you spend. Just watch out, it's so smooth that you might find yourself downing this bad boy quickly but it WILL creep up on you. Be aware"
Dragon's Milk,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH goblet glass

This beer is completely black with no visible highlights and about one fingers worth of dark tan head that quickly recedes leaving behind a fair amount of lacing.

Lots of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon caramel, and coffee. The bourbon is fairly strong, but not overpowering, and adds just a bit of spice to the nose.

The dominant flavors are that of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, coffee, and to a lesser degree vanilla. Just the right amount of bourbon character, noticeable but not overpowering. Very well balanced. Full bodied and mildly carbonated.

Overall, this is a very nice Barrel Aged Stout, a great mix of barrel character and base beer, neither leaning too heavily on the other."
Dragon's Milk,4.38,"L- Black.....1/4 inch head....thick lacing

S-Roasty chocolate, char, coffee bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel

T- similar to the nose.....bourbon barrel, chocolate, coffee, vanilla

F- Medium plus.....creamy......low carb......

O- Great for the price"
Dragon's Milk,4.03,"Not a ton of barrel tones but more a balanced bourbon and vanilla flavor. I more or less hated the variants I've tried and I made it clear what I thought about those but the original I think I definitely understand better, this is pretty good and don't mind I bought a pack of it. I served this to myself in one of those weird sour glasses and it works. I get people roasting this for calling it basic but that's the thing it is basic but this actually decently crafted. The variants I had to me not so much"
Dragon's Milk,4.25,"Appearance: Deep amber in color with a massive, coarse, and quite persistent tan head. Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls. Before a strong light at the thinnest part of the glass, some slight ruby highlights can be seen.

Aroma: Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, bitter cocoa, vinous alcohol, molasses and caramel dominate the aroma. There are also notes of wood; the alcohol is quite spicy.

Taste: The taste begins with notes of molasses, caramel, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, dark fruit, spicy alcohol. As the taste progresses, the wood and bourbon notes firm a solid undercurrent to the taste, advancing as the taste progresses, as well as bitter cocoa. The alcohol produces a moderate and pleasant warming sensation. The taste concludes with a modest and lingering wave of bourbon and wood.

Mouth feel: Fairly full and soft, with only modest carbonation.

Drinkabilty/notes: Really quite nice, and a fitting toast to the New Year of 2022. Would pair admirably with rich chocolate desserts.

Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip."
Dragon's Milk,4.02,"12oz bottle, served in a snifter glass. Bottled on 09/30/21 09:26.

Appearance: Pitch black, light tan dense head. Some strands and sheets of lacing which dissipated very slowly.

Smell: Vanilla, light oak, bourbon.

Taste: Well blended chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roasted malt. Nothing really stands out among the flavors. All are mild and well blended together.

Mouthfeel: Nice thickness, quite warming from the higher ABV, even though it's not harsh or that noticeable. Dry finish. Very light carbonation.

Overall / Drinkability: A very subtle/smooth barrel aged stout. There is some bourbon barrel character, but it's mixed in with all the other flavors. A good sipping beer - quite drinkable. Would pair well with some desserts, and maybe a few other main courses as well. Quite nice and I wouldn't mind having it again."
Dragon's Milk,3.83,"dated bottle pours pitch black, with a decent tan head that crashes fairly quick, no lacing after 1/4 down...smells prett good, the bourbon barrel smell is dominant, and the taste is pretty boring. sweetness, and more sweetness, and slight booziness. some char/roastiness, and well, that's it. Too fuckin sweet and simplistic for the high price . Very over rated. Not bad, just not as good as the rating is here on this place. Won't get anymore, Narwhal is better...this is just too damn sweet , thin, and simple for the price/rating. Pass."
Dragon's Milk,4.23,"Appearance: Dark brown to black, big head.

Smell: Chocolate, wood, vanilla, booze.

Taste: Sweet chocolate, then moderate barrel-wood flavor. Sweet throughout, with a somewhat light feel for the ABV.

Overall: Another classic that I've finally got around to reviewing. I've had Dragon's Milk at beerfests and bars, but never reviewed. It's a very good beer, maybe a slight step lower than some of the other heavyweights but still quite tasty."
Dragon's Milk,4.49,"Given to me from a four-pack of bottles from a friend. Poured into a proper brandy snifter.

L - Pitch black with a one-finger cream-colored head. Pours very thick, with delicate legs.
S - Cacao is very upfront. Notes of leather, vanilla, and brown sugar.
T - Vanilla and cacao are the stars here! Leads slowly into a deep toffee with bourbon and coffee notes. You can't really taste the 11%, but it gives off 11% vibes. Finish is a lingering bourbon and sweet chocolate.
F - Silky, full-bodied, and with light - almost nitro-like - carbonation. It's strong for sure, but you can definitely handle another bottle.
O - A well-done brew of the style. A must-try. The best lounge beer, provided you're in a leather chair and next to a warm fire! I will buy this so long as they keep making it. Again, well done!"

Arcane Rituals,4.25,"Pours a deep amber brown color with thin tan head. Smells of sweet dark fruit and caramel. The taste is of caramel brown sugar and toffee, bitter boozy finish. The feel is full bodied and smooth, subtle burn. Overall a fantastic barleywine."
Arcane Rituals,4.51,"Pours a very dark brown with no head formation after a modest pour straight into the glass. Some oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl. Aroma is dark fruits, fig, toffee, and brown sugar with a hearty throughout. Caramel, toasty, and light bready malts shape the rest of the beer aroma profile. Sweet cognac and light bourbon heat pair up with barrel character for a subtle twist of heat within an otherwise sugar nose. Flavor profile is cognac booze right up front, paired together with dark fruits and figs. After the opening act, bourbon, brown sugar, almond, and grassy, herbal hops take over, forming a slightly sticky, firmly sweet flavor profile. Barrel character is minor, instead allowing individual liquors to shine and simmer in the spotlight. Wonderful dynamics and shape from start to finish. Mouth feel is a boiled-over-medium texture with a near still effervescence that carries a consistent minor fluffiness throughout. Just a little bit plush, but mostly flat. Thickness is medium-thick. Overall, really incredible use of various liquor influences to enhance and build on a dark fruit, fig, and toffee forward ale. Despite only being 11.37% ABV for this batch's bottling, it's a powerhouse of flavor.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 500mL bottle. 2021 release. ""Batch 002"". ABV: 11.37%."
Arcane Rituals,4.68,"2021 vintage, 11.37 ABV

Just what I hoped it'd be. The barrels are prominent, I get some bourbon and plenty of brandy/cognac, can't quite tease these two apart but I taste plenty of boozy fruit. They also bring hints of vanilla and leather. An incredibly decadent base beer shines through as well. Quite sweet, with notes of toffee, brown sugar, cherry, figs, and so much more. I love the lingering boozy exhale. The body is full and sticky with light carbonation. Lives up to the hype."
Arcane Rituals,4.5,12/28/2021: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a stemless wine glass. Thanks to Josh for the share. I sampled this right after VSOJ so that is a tough follow but this beer is excellent in mouthfeel and flavor.
Arcane Rituals,4.72,"Pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. Opaque and shiny. Thin, velvety tan head forms on the beer before dissipating. The only residual head is a thin ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma is incredibly rich and pungent for a barleywine. There are notes of rich bread, fruit cake, dark fruit and overly ripe cherries, toffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, along with strong barrel notes that carry notes of each - cognac, brandy, and bourbon.

Taste follows the nose with notes of boozy fruit cake, dark cherries, oak, light tannic notes, toffee, brown sugar, with light notes of vanilla and cocoa with a slight cherry tartness on the back end. Lots of barrel character comes through with clear notes of brandy, bourbon, and cognac showing up in the profile. Its sweet - not too sweet, but definitely on the sweeter side of barleywines. The profile overall is decadent, rich and flavorful. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous. Carbonation is sprightly but nicely balanced. Trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is an amazing barleywine - I know I have used the word decadent multiple times in the review, but it really is the best way to describe this beer."
Arcane Rituals,5,This may be the best ba barleywine I ever had! Nice work as usual Bottle Logic!!!!
Arcane Rituals,4.5,"Appearance: Very dark brown color with a medium sized beige head that slowly faded but stuck around nicely. A good looking Barleywine.

Smell: Bourbon & fruity brandy aromas jump out the glass. I also pickup moderate brown sugar aromas. The nose is inviting.

Taste: Toffee/brown sugar, Bourbon notes, and Brandy notes all make their presence felt in the flavor profile. The beer starts off fairly sweet and though it dries up a bit in the finish, it still has a fair bit of sweetness. Maybe because I know what was used but I swear I can pick up peach notes from the Peach brandy barrels it was aged in. Mild alcohol presence for the listed 11.37% ABV.

Mouth-feel: on the full side of medium-bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Full mouthfeel for a BW.

Overall: A very good Barleywine for my tastes. Somewhat on the sweet side but it has a nice, complex, and tasty flavor profile."
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.52,"2020 vintage

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.22,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done."
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.33,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts."
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.8,"2015 vintage
Look: very dark. Some cola highlights when held to light. Sparse head of course.
Smell: mellow Black Tuesday underneath. Vanilla, bourbon fudge.
Taste: like the nose. Unbelievably mellow for such a monster."
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.55,"Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.

Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days

Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol

Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey

Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb

Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there.

I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,4.56,"Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.

Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.

Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.

Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly."
Moment Of Clarity,4.53,"Canned 2022, no further dating available.

This is lovely. Balanced, approachable, and extremely easy to drink. The sweet stout base shine through in all its chocolate milky glory. The extra additions play minor supporting roles only, with the coffee being the least noticeable unfortunately."
Moment Of Clarity,4.16,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black with a bubbly tan head.

Smell - The maple really came through in the nose. Chocolate notes were also present.

Taste - The initial profile was dominated by chocolate and maple. There was a coffee presence. The finish had vanilla, but was mostly chocolate.

Mouthfeel - The milky nature of the stout made it quite nice.

Overall - I have had better milk stouts."
Moment Of Clarity,2.83,Liker of Milk Stout but this one was wY to much for me..this one gets into that black licorice and boozy taste wherea I like my milk stouts with a hint of chocolate snd lighter.
Moment Of Clarity,4.52,"This one pours like thick motor oil and yields a beautiful two-finger mocha head that hangs out for a while.

The nose is of dark roast coffee, roasted malt and a touch of mapley sweetness. I can’t wait to dive in.

The feel is thick and chewy, and the taste follows the nose; robust coffee notes with a touch of sweet maple. Fantastic stout with huge flavor. And loving that it’s only 7.7%. (The fact that I used the word “only” goes to show how out of control ABVs have gotten!)

One drawback as I get deeper into the glass is that the bitter burnt coffee notes that I found pleasant at the beginning turn into a laborious astringency that makes me take the taste points down a notch."
Moment Of Clarity,4.67,"If I could have a can of this in my fridge at all times, I would. Just a great non BA maple stout - perfection for what it is."
Moment Of Clarity,3.97,In general I’m not a fan of milk stouts but I do enjoy having this moment of clarity.
Moment Of Clarity,5,WOW that's delicious!
Moment Of Clarity,4.22,"Capped off a week on the cape with a pick up from tree house on the way back. The selections at sandwich are limited, so I ordered a 4-pack.

It pours marvelously and has a thickly dark tabacco black. Aroma brings coffee and chocolate tones. The taste follows but for me the prune overwhelms.

This is my first milk stout, so unfortunately im comparing this to memories of barrel aged stouts."
Moment Of Clarity,3.97,Can courtesy of yllib.
Kalamazoo Stout,4,Super roasty stout hits the sweet spot for a standard smokey malt and dry stout.
Kalamazoo Stout,4.46,"Heavy chocolate and lactose notes, almost like chocolate milk with some malty character. Black body with a brief flash of a dark beige head. Carbonated thick feel. Plentiful coffee notes in the after taste. Very proper stout that is pleasurable to sip. Some savoring of the beer lets out some of the licorice notes and it comes out a little bit more as it warms."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.77,"Pours oily black with a finger of mocha head quickly reducing to a frothy cap, leaving plenty of residual, soapy lacing. Nose is coffee, roasted malt, bitter hop, and dark chocolate. Taste follows suit with the tasting notes in that order. Finishes a delightfully crisp but full feel. Excellent."
Kalamazoo Stout,4.35,"L - deep black with a tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing.
S - Lots of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, hints of coffee and licorice
T - follows the nose: roasted dark malt, dark chocolate, molasses, coffee all intermixed with hints of licorice and some hops on the back end. Slight nuttiness
F - medium leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.
O - a really solid sessionable stout here with a relatively complex flavor profile. Very nicely done."
Kalamazoo Stout,4.27,"Pretty good. Licorice and coffee very strong with a mild dark chocolate aftertaste. Bitter but not too much so. Thick but not too much so.
Drink well my friends!"
Kalamazoo Stout,4.18,"Chocolate black with cherry highlights and stiff, creamy sepia foam; lots of fresh roast coffee on the nose; pretzel, bits of fig, walnut, root beer + leather, licorice, espresso + a roasty end; creamy, astringent, bitter. Plum as it warms.

4 4 4.25 4.25 4.25

This starts out as the All-American stout: bitter, coffee-driven, big, clean, and dangerously easy.
But licorice is a strange choice of adjuncts. On top of that, over multiple tastings, quite a few dark fruity (ester?) notes come out as it warms. Is this recipe old enough to date from when US breweries were aping English styles? That would explain a lot.
In the end, strong roast cuts across it all. This scratches the itch for anyone looking for something punchy. But would something this idiosyncratic would ever come out today?

A deserving, if shifty, classic."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.94,"DATE: February 5, 2022... OCCASION: a cold Saturday night deserves a flavorful stout... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith tulip pint... this pours a jet black body with a dirty tan head whose thickness settles rather evenly and laces the glass with intricacies... coffee bean, chocolate, licorice, raisin, baked bread and subtle spices, all laid out to a palatable degree... the texture is thick, its presence at the teeth notable, its body bigger than its ABV... the finish is memorable, warming and coating... it hints at the creaminess of a milk stout, the dryness of an extra, and a graininess that sets it in a unique space... the flavor melds chocolate, licorice and cake into a dessert-like experience, its lactic qualities downplayed and its coffee comes to the foreground... the raisin and pepper also arrive in time... I like this as a sessionable beer, substantial yet sippable, flavorful yet not too demanding... it checks off the necessary stout characteristics, and though it may not do any of them excellently, it combines them into a quality product..."
Kalamazoo Stout,4,"A good solid beer. Nothing to write home about, but also nothing that turns it off."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.21,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at 40 degrees F, and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Pours a deep inky black, because, well, stout. Forms a half-finger of pale tan head that vanishes swiftly to a ring.

S: Chocolate and coffee notes dominate the nose, with an underlying backbone of loam and some faint tobacco hints. As it warms, the nose remains similar.

T: The taste follows the nose rather well, at least while refrigerated. Cold coffee and cocoa, with some loamy and tobacco notes. As the beer warms, a rather large bitter ash/pine presence swells up out of the background to claim center stage and hurl everything else into the background - apparently a hop presence that overwhelms my odd palate. Alas.

F: Full and thick, like drinking a warmed syrup.

O: While cold, I enjoy this stout. As it warms and the hop presence manifests, I unfortunately am not as able to enjoy it. Ah well. Please take my taste and overall scoring numbers in reference to the particulars of my palate - though as I enjoy other hefty IBU stouts like Old Rasputin, I feel validated in actually rating and scoring."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.7,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a beer mug

L - Dark brown/black, 1-2 fingers of light tan head which settles down to a 1cm thick layer which is unusually dense that sticks around, sticks to the glass very thickly with fine lacing. Beautiful.

S - Dark roasted malt, brown sugar and caramel, with the tiniest bit of licorice in there, no hops that I can spot. Solid stout bouquet.

T - Smoke and blackened malt with very dark chocolate, small but sharp hop profile, licorice is nowhere to be found, the flavor is all somewhat muted actually, almost like everything has been watered down. Feeling pretty letdown here.

M - Medium-heavy body, carbonation is moderate, at least it does drink like a real stout

This one is all over the place. It's gorgeous, it smells great, the mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Everything except the actual taste is here. Wish it had some more flavor, this shouldn't be the factor dragging down the rest of the beer."
Kalamazoo Stout,4.17,"A very nice looking beer pours pitch black, and dense. I did not expect the slowly rising head you get on bigger stouts one a 6 % one but that’s exactly what happened. A slow to rise creamy mocha tan looking head. Then it settles into rocky terrain creamy froth. As I stated a very nice looking beer.

The aroma to me is big in burnt and roasty. The things that come to mind for me are dark chocolate and dark roast black coffee. Also get a touch of something licorice like.

Tastes is nice burnt dark roast coffee. It also reminds me of those dark chocolates that are high up in the cocoa %. I’d even say there is almost like a burnt tobacco thing going on.

Medium bodied but super smooth. It’s almost creamy because of the carbonation. Very nice big bitter lingering finish. I swear it’s almost like smoking a cigarette with coffee aftertaste. I haven’t had a cigarette in ages but you know you can never get that taste to leave. That’s what this beer does but in a good way."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.51,"Poured moderately hard from a bottle into a snifter glass, quickly forming a few fingers of frothy brown head that slowly faded to heavy and leggy lacing. Deep brown body, totally opaque. Smell is a bit of licorice, moderate and not overpowering. Taste is malty in the background, some bitter chocolate and coffee, and ending with an aftertaste of hops. Drinkable, but really not my kind of stout with the bitterness and hops. Not quite medium bodied, moderate bite of carbonation. Drinkable, but just not my style."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.79,"Appearance:
An impressive, double finger of creamed mocha froth floats steadily on a lake of imperturbable black. But while the head is twice as strong, retention is half as long. What little lace it offers comes in jilted, broken webbing.

Bouquet:
Chestnuts and sips of black coffee hiding in a vast field of dark grains. Hops appear and disappear on the horizon, too distant to rightly identify. While crossing that grain field, straining to get a closer look at those hops, you'll sometimes trip over a gnarled root of baker’s chocolate.

Feel:
Slender and supple, like tucking the tongue under a cooling bedsheet. A low yet continual presence of breezy bubbles brings the hidden hops forward during the linger.

Taste:
Reallllly subtle toasted dark malts speckled with droplets of silky, chocolate milk and topped with crushed chestnuts. A lick of licorice bitters and herbal hops chase away the sugar, maintaining the manly lineage a traditional stout should boast: smooth, roasty, and mildly bitter.

Overall:
Exceedingly mild, the casual drinker may have trouble tasting anything other than “dark beer.” A good starter stout for the uninitiated."
Kalamazoo Stout,4,"A classic American stout. I highly enjoyed this, the chocolate and coffee is balanced well with the Itty bitty licorice finish. For some reason I think I like this a bit more than anticipated. Definitely getting again."
Kalamazoo Stout,3.86,"As a new Michigander, I will be exploring the breweries of Michigan.. here is my first entry from Bell's Brewery, their Kalamazoo Stout. Upon opening, an earthy, hoppy, slightly metallic smell greets the nostrils. The brew pours dark, and forms a respectable mocha colored head, which modestly laces as you consume. The taste is good.. a bit overly hoppy to my taste buds, but the hops, and malt form a tangible licorice note atop the chocolate and coffee blend expected from a good stout. The mouthfeel is nice, substantial but not sticky.. this stout goes down smoothly, It tastes better as you go.. I'm looking forward to my second one, already. We have a winner here!"
Kalamazoo Stout,4.03,"Seems like here lately the IPA craze (not that I mind it) makes it more difficult for me to find the dark beers I love here in Ga.
But I came across this and I am a fan of Bell's. So I bought and quaffed and enjoyed this stout. It is a solid, very good beer. Nice thickish pour, dark head. Smooth, complex dark malts some nice bitterness and alcohol at the end. If you are a stout fan you will enjoy this one. Another good beer from one of my favorite breweries."
Sunday Brunch,4.71,"Deep, dark black. Head was not as dark as I guessed it would be, more of an off white color. Strangely the nose is cinnamon at first, but after first taste then the nose was more coffee. Taste was cinnamon coffee with a smooth finish. Not bitter, all smooth!! Great Porter."
Sunday Brunch,3.69,"2022-02-06
500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.

Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer."
Sunday Brunch,4.85,"Pours black with a light brown solid head. Super coffee roast aroma, very pungent. Taste is heavy coffee as well, with a lot of maple sweetness; the cinnamon comes through strong as well. Thick mouthfeel, carbonation was a little lacking, which is pretty much the only flaw in this excellent beer."
Sunday Brunch,4.5,"-Thanks to Stephanie (Kane)
- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon.

A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity.

S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights.

T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile.

M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive.

O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary."
Sunday Brunch,4.59,"Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind.

Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes.

Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded.

Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b

Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout."

Ayinger Celebrator,5,"A wonderful, complex dopplebock
with a rich brown-red color, chocolate undertones and a bread scent that is pleasant.Pairs very well with the Buffalo Stew at Tommy’s Joynt in San Francisco. One of the little plastic goats you get on the bottle has hung from the steering column of every car I have ever owned."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.3,"Everything you would want in a Dobblebock. A little sweet taste, with a tiny bitter finish. One is all you need. A great beer to start a night out!"
Ayinger Celebrator,4.45,"poured from a 330mL bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a fairly dark brown with almost three fingers of wet sand-colored foam. dark fruits, rye bread, hints of coffee even and some toasted malts. it’s robust and smells like a big beer, which i suppose it kind of is. a huge malt presence in the taste coupled with dark rye bread, raisins and coffee. this is not quite a sipper but it’s not refreshing or drinkable either. it’s rich, full and hearty. packed to the brim with flavor. a full, malty mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. this is a real treat. certainly far from a daily drinker but it’s easy enough to take down a small bottle or even 2 if the mood struck. really enjoyed this one and it’s been far too long since i’ve had this offering."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.23,"Appearance: Pours a mildly clear (40% clarity), dark amber to brown color with a strong tan head. SRM of 19.

Aroma: Initially, strong bready aromas stand out upfront. Among them some chocolate notes. Hints of licorice, dark fruit, and caramel to support.

Flavor: Strong flavors of dark bread upfront. A strong dark bread yeast is present that gives a bit of bubblegum and bread spice. After this, getting more licorice, roasted black malt before a chocolate and caramel sweet malt finish off the end.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is malty, but relatively dry for the ABV. A bread spice and chocolate flavor linger.

Overall: A fantastic doppelbock. Honestly I haven't had a doppelbock that wasn't fanatastic. This one nails the flavors and probably leans more bready than the others, but hard to tell. Exactly what a doppelbock should be. Should probably compare to others to see if this one is truly better. (Rating: 4.23)"
Ayinger Celebrator,4.42,"L: Pours a deep brown head with ruby undertones. Tan head has good retention.

S: Rich, toasted malts dominate with a bit of spice and dark fruits.

F: Medium bodied, heavy carbonation. Gives you that warming alcohol feel you’d expect with a stronger beer.

O: Delicious and complex beer."

Ayinger Celebrator,4.03,"1.5 0.333L Bottles = 0.5 L
Glass: 0.5L Ayinger Pokal
Serving Temp: approx. 50 degrees F


Look: Deep and opaque chestnut brown. I cannot see even my fingers thru the glass even when held up to a light. 3"" tan head that fills the glass from the the 0.5L mark to the rim. The head lasts a fairly long time and persists as a 0.25"" cover even after I start drinking the beer. Good lacing down the sides of the glass

Smell: Deep and rich malts. Fresh baked whole grain dark bread such as pumpernickel. Dark cocoa.

Taste: Rich malts with toasted pumpernickel bread. Chocolate and cocoa. Some raisin with hints of anise. Finishes on a dry note.

Feel: Smooth and rich. Mouth-coating. Medium body.

Overall: An excellent doppelbock that deserves its world class reputation. The dark bread and chocolate notes, along with the dry (but not bitter) finish, are exactly what I look to find in doppelbocks. Very nice on a cool evening in Lent or in the fall."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.42,On tap in Wisconsin. Just what I want in this style. Very smooth and drinkable with some sneaky alcohol. Went great with my meal. Had this a couple times and will choose it again.
Ayinger Celebrator,3,"It's a great Doppelbock. But if you were never a fan of Doppelbock, this one won't change you."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.33,"Very dark, opaque, almost black, with a garnet tinge around the edges, and two fingers of light brown head that dissipates quickly - to be expected given the 6.7% ABV. The smell is rich and powerfully malty, with sweet dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, and beef broth. The taste mostly follows the nose, but is not quite as strong, which I found slightly disappointing, but at the same time makes this beer more drinkable - almost dangerously so. The warming spirit alcohol is noticeable but unobtrusive, and wouldn't slow you down all that much from necking this stuff if you didn't know better. Overall an intense, complex, rewarding beer -in other words, par for the course for a Doppelbock, and another home run from Ayinger."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.94,"Pours deep ruby with an enormous khaki head, which sticks around, and leaves quite a bit of lacing all the way down to the bottom.

Rich malty goodness on the nose. Almost a bit like beef consomme as well, which actually follows through on the palate. Good fresh baked brown bread.

Entry is semisweet, complex. The malt, the brown bread, that faintly meaty beefy note I always associate with bock style.

Feels good and heavy, just this side of overpowering I would say. Really stays with you, without that overhopped bitterness some bock, doppel or otherwise, can have. A real mouthfiller...

Overall this may be the ideal doppelbock, perfect expression of the style. I've been going back and reviewing a lot of old favorites, and I'm about to branch out into some of the more modern expressions, so I'm thinking of beers like this as setting the standard. This Ayinger has got a bit of a potent ABV, not so much as a Belgian ale or a modern IPA, but combined with that lingering aftertaste, makes for a pretty satisfying bottle. And I also think something should be said for the label, which may be the coolest label of any beer I can think of right now... Two goats (two goats get it?) rampantly celebrating a pretty large footed, dimpled glass of doppelbock... Truth in advertising! Putting this one up at the top rank with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as maybe the ideal expression of a variety.

As a side note, I'm old enough to remember when American Brewers like Pabst and Yuengling used to put out their seasonal spring bocks; in fact my grandfather used to bring a case or two of the Yuengling bock back in the trunk of his Galaxie, from our Easter trips to Pennsylvania, which was right around the time they seemed to release these beers back in the day. I remember the steel cans of Pabst Bock with the goats head on them..."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.24,"Pours very nicely, about an inch and a half head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Looks very nice in the glass! It’s almost black, like a deep blood red but more opaque than some ruby red beers (like Guinness, which is a bit clearer)

The smell is malty and coffee like, with a bit of fruit, reminds me of dried cherries covered in dark chocolate. Taste is very complex, smooth and malty at first, like toasty graham crackers but evolves over time into a mild spicy flavourful mix of mild fruits, raisins, caramel. Very savoury beer! The mouthfeel isn’t exceptional but by no means bad, it’s very smooth with low carbonation — I think I got an older bottle.

It tastes how you want a beer to taste when you hear it’s a world class, complex beer. Some folks say it doesn’t linger on the tongue, but my experience was completely opposite. An exceptional double bock, with the caveat that I’m just getting back into beer and haven’t had many double bocks, it’s excellent amongst all beers I’ve tried!"
Ayinger Celebrator,4,"1/27/2022 - coffee colored, thin cream colored head; rich full bodied flavor with a distinctive but odd aftertaste; good, but not remarkable mouthfeel; a good looking tasty beer, no complaints."
Ayinger Celebrator,4.06,"I bought a 4 pack of 330ml bottles at 6.7% at the LCBO in Ontario. Nice looking bottles
Just seen them today was excited.
Opened the bottle a little smoke on the opening
Nice 1finger creamy head poured into glass dark reddish color spicy malty smell of caramel and coffee
Sweet malty and rich this beer is very smooth and nice flavors coming through of coffee and hint of chocolate and caramel.
Finest Bavarian double Bock
That's the style of the beer almost like a stout beer
Overall a very interesting and enjoyable beer to drink with a low to medium bitterness level"
Ayinger Celebrator,4.58,"11.2 Oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. (L1097 is stamped on the bottle?)
Dark red cola body with a light tan head. Moderate retention. Some lacing.

A dominant malt scent greets me as I pour it into a glass. I'm getting some cherry sweetness and a little spice. Nutmeg?

Taste follows with more cherries. A slightly bitter finish that came out of nowhere.

Mouthfeel had a surprisingly large amount of carbonation

Great representation of the style !"
Ayinger Celebrator,4.45,"The general consensus seems to be that this one is the best of the Doppelbochs and it's hard to dispute. From the first pour to the finish it is a first class treat. Clear, extra dark brown appearance and large tan head with moderate lacing. Complex aroma of cinnamon graham crackers, caramel, toasted malts and dark fruit. Rich malt flavor that i would need a thesaurus to do it justice. Full bodied, modestly carbonated mouthfeel leading to a long, lingering finish. Highly recommended."

Alright, time to knock out another style topper! This one is always being discussed on the forums, but I can never seem to find it near me. Luckily when I stopped in Half Time the other day, they had some relatively fresh bottles, so I knew I had to pick it up. Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses

It’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer. Finishes off dry

This is great stuff, a classic for a reason. I’ll definitely have to pick up more"
Supplication,4.21,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

Overall, very interesting and very good beer."
Supplication,4.49,"Brief Review:

O: My 2nd of 3rd RR sours I picked up from SF. This may be their highest rated. Nice brown ale with cherries, almost like a Flander's. Not too tart, which I like. Flavors are nice and clean. Good balance overall.

Recommendation: Doesn't really blow me away for a sour with this kind of reputation, but it drinks nice and is a good Spring/Summer beer."
Supplication,4.45,Wild! Received this from a good friend in the Bay Area. Works for me - it’s complex and skewed towards sour funkiness… very much feels sophisticated.
Supplication,4.4,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $13.99. Bottled 4-27-21; consumed 4-26-22.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.

Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.

Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.

Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!"

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer

Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum

It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it

This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!"
Supplication,4.46,"2011 on tap in 2021

Smell - tart cherry and woody
Taste - fantastic tart cherries and a ton of wood
Feel - medium body creamy with a slight carb
Ovearll - just a wonderful beer and shocked its this good after 10 yeras"
Supplication,4.6,"Pours a brown color with tinges of red on the edges, all underneath a light tan head that evaporates quickly. The nose is loads of tart cherries, caramel, and some Brett. Wow.

The tart cherries and Brett are forward on the taste, with the caramel at the back of the palate for balance. This is the most delicious wild ale I’ve ever tasted.

The mouthfeel is medium and a bit spritzy. For me, this is a world class beer."

Russian River Brewing
Date: 21 November 2019
I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!"
Supplication,4.25,Great sour beer.

Supplication,4.44,"Pours a dark nutty brown with mild fog. Head is a finger and a half of tan foam that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is cherry, Pinot noir, with a earthy, bready malts and stone and cellar notes. Flavor profile is cherry with stone, cellar, Pinot noir, berry, and bready malts. Mouth feel is bubbly and effervescent with a medium thickness. Overall, big depth with a little sour zing and a sweet wine pop. Well aged, considering this was bottled March 12, 2019, and reviewed/consumed on May 22, 2021.

Served in a stemless wine glass from a 375mL bottle."
Supplication,4.67,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite."
Supplication,4.88,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right?

Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable. (Not a pro in the slightest and this is my 1st review, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I just had to put in my 2 cents because this is truly amazing.)"
Supplication,4.35,"Poured from cellar temp on 3/7/2021 bottle dare 8/25/2015

Pours a reddish amber with a cream colored head that leaves a ring of lacing.

Nose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation.

Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer.

Feel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length.

Overall, this beer has held up incredibly well. Balance between candied cherry, and the pinot barrels is excellent. There is some oxidation, but do not think it is making this beer worse, but adds to the complexity."
Supplication,4.65,"Look: A deep reddish-orange hue.
Smell/Taste: The taste and smell are exactly what one would hope for in a wild ale. Some fantastic cherry sour taste and aroma, with the aged pinot and oak barrels providing some deep complexity

Overall: This is one of my all time favorites. I had tried a number of wild ales before, but this is the on that got me hooked. Absolutely, a tremendous beer"
Trappist Dubbel,4.21,"Poured from a 1 pint 9.4 ounce bottle with cap into a St. Bernardus chalice style glass, ""Bottled on"" date 6-10-21, ""Best by"" date 6-10-23.

APPEARANCE: pours a very dark brown color with two-fingers tan head, excellent retention, the head slowly dissipated until a thin layer of small bubbles remained, there is heavy lacing on the glass, It's hard to see carbonation because it's a very dark color but the mouthfeel tells me it's higher than average carbonation.

SMELL: sweet caramel, bread and a roasted note.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet caramel and bread then a roasted note.

PALATE: full body and higher carbonation, somewhat creamy.

OVERALL: this is a great looking beer, I really like the the way it looks in the glass and enjoyed the mouthfeel, it's not as sweet as some other Dubbel's I have had, this is not my favorite Dubbel, I prefer Chimay but it's very good and I would be pleased to have it again, I would happily recommend this to anyone who enjoys the style."
Trappist Dubbel,4.37,"Served from a tap into a 14 ounce goblet, this is a deep mahogany color with a dark biege head. It smells very malty, a little roasted and with a slight hint of esters. It is quite malty with a near perfect amount of roastedness. That, with the hops, add just the right bitterness to make for a wonderful balance. After a full blast of flavor, the exit is clean and refreshing, but it couldn't be considered crisp, nor dry. The mouthfeel ranks with some of the smoothest stouts. There's only slight glass lacing, but the head sustains. This is one to seek out."
Trappist Dubbel,4.11,"Bottled March 2021.

A clear ruddy brown with a dense, light brown head with great retention and lacing. The nose is lovely with soft brown sugar, yeasty spices, soft esters, a light cola note. A touch of earth. Lovely make depth with a soft Candi sugar sweetness. The palate opens brisk with a high level of fine carbonation that complements the malt and yeast esters. Cola, brown sugar, warm, yeasty bread, cola, a touch of honey with a really dry finish that just works. Soft , earthy bitterness on the finish. Light in body and with a long, complex finish."
Trappist Dubbel,4.56,"12 oz bottled on Feb 11, 2021 and poured into a snifter shows a Ruby red body that glows slightly more orange when backlit and floats a 1"" cap of cream colored mixed bubbles that maintains a constant 1/16"" cover.
The fruity aroma jumps with pouring and excites the palate with anticipation. Banana, fig, raisins with a thin coating of toffee and the taste matches.

Active carbonation makes for a lighter, yet full feel, with no sharp bite. Smooth and sexy.

Such a pleasure."
Trappist Dubbel,4.44,"Brouwerij Westmalle ""Dubbel""
11.2 fl. oz. brown glass bottle ""BEST BEFORE END: 2023 JUN 01"". Sampled on 2022 MAR 31.

Notes via stream of consciousness: You can tell that it's got some carbonation to it as your pour it because the head wants to come right out at you. Damn, I got the lees carried over in the final pour. Oh well, what can you do? It's a surprisingly dark brown with glimmers of ruby when held to the light. The head is a two-finger thick cap of tan foam. The aroma displays quite a bit of the yeast character with notes of banana, sticky golden raisins, fig, clove, dark caramel, aged wood that's been dampened, and mineral. The taste is fuller with additional notes of crusty browned bread, golden caramel, spice, orange marmalade, demarara sugar, bubblegum, and plum. The alcohol doesn't readily appear but it's there, and it probably helps the firm bitterness to balance it and lead to a dry finish that lingers with some earthy spiciness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and lightly zesty and effervescent with a natural, fine-bubbled carbonation. This is a classic of the style!
Review #7,856"
Trappist Dubbel,4.14,"Ruby brown with a solid two inches of light tan head. The nose is grapes, plums, brown bread, raisins, and a sweetness like bottle caps candy. A distinct maltiness follows everything. The taste is prunes, raisins, slightly burnt sugar, and this time the bread is rye. The finish is fruity and slightly bitter. It is medium bodied and just a bit thick. There are dark fruits everywhere! It is sweet, but not so you really notice. Really good beer."
Trappist Dubbel,4.25,"Poured from a bottle at fridge temp. Pours dark brown with a good amount of tan head. Nose is malts, figs, prunes, apricots, toffee, malts, and dark bread.

Trappist Dubbel,4.07,"Cloudy amber/brown with minimal head, and mild malt nose. Really had to let it warm to open up. My palate has changed over the years, because I remember this beer being much more flavorful. Maybe the flavor standard has just increased beyond reason. This is a good, easy drinking, well balanced beer, just not as big in flavor as I was expecting."
Trappist Dubbel,3.71,"Cola colored pour with a medium amount of coffee ice cream colored head. Medium retention and good lacing. Aroma is somewhat muted, with sweet fruity esters present, along with faint caramel. Taste is pleasant, yet somehow unremarkable. It goes down very easily, and it's tasty, but it lacks much in the way of complexity. There's more caramel on the tongue than the nose, and overall it's relatively sweet. This is a good example of a beer that doesn't wow me, but it's still very nice to drink and I'd be happy to have multiple of this while hanging out at a bar with friends. In some respects, maybe that's what beer is supposed to be."
Trappist Dubbel,4.25,"Thick foamy head upon pouring. Slightly tangy, nutty, fruity, & bready in taste. Overall, a good double."
Trappist Dubbel,3.59,"Murky brown body, unfiltered, with an overzealous, sandy head that has a minute or two retention before fizzling to nothing.
Aromas of root beer and cola, dark caramel, mildly nutty, prunes.
Flavour matches the aroma, sugary cola, medjool dates, powdered cocoas, and bubblegum; rising alcohol heat, light bittering hops, and good attenuation make a valiant attempt to balance things out in the finish, partially successful, leaving things semi-dry; there's a mild sense of rye spice; medium body and carbonation, with a syrupy feel.

I had hoped for more complexity and yeast character, but this mostly a sugar bomb. If you enjoy a coke, you'll enjoy this."
Trappist Dubbel,4.83,"Nice light rocky head stays with the beer all the way through, nice Belgian lace.
Mild delicious nose

Spicy funky brown sugar, leaves you wanting to drink more."
Trappist Dubbel,4.21,"Pours a dark, but transparent, burgundy-brown. Three fingers of khaki foam after half a pour straight into the glass. Aroma is big fruity esters - plum, raisin, and grape. Comes off sweet like jam. Clove and yeast permeate the back end. Flavor profile is grape, plum, fruit, and raisins. Fruit esters are gigantic. Touch of clove and bready malts to round it out. Mouth feel is fuzzy and velvety with a medium-thick consistency. It's expansive and frothy on the tongue. Overall, just sublime. Fruit notes are through the roof.

Some cane sugar and starfruit in there as well. Beer opens grapefruit, pear, and apple. An interesting take on the tropical fruit flavor profile. The middle yields notes of citrus, a touch of grassiness, and more pear skin. End is more pear, apple, and citrus fruit. Finish bone dry with an aftertaste of citrus rind.

Received from @beersnake1 in Bif15 , poured into a smog city brewing glass also from him. The #4 ranked barley wine on beer advocate is a double barrel aged barley wine


Brewers Notes: A blend of two different Double Barrel-Aged Barleywines. The first Barleywine was aged in a Woodford Reserve Malt Whiskey barrel for over 20 months, then finished in a combination of Weller and Blanton Bourbon casks for close to a year. The second Barleywine was first aged in an Armagnac puncheon for close to two year, then finished in a blend of Heaven Hill Rye and Sazerac Rye casks. Each beer was cold-conditioned in stainless, and then blended together to create this Double Barrel-Aged Barleywine.


Dark , murky, muddy brown liquid capped by a thin taupe foam layer , quickly recedes to a taupe ring

Aroma is bourbon, raisins, toffee

Taste is bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, dark fruits ,

Mouthfeel is soft and fizzy , sweet , the 15.7 % abv is very well hidden

Great beer , another want ticked off my list courtesy of @beersnake1, thank you"
Double Double Cask,5,"WOW,what a kick ass beer!"
Double Double Cask,4.51,"A: Pour an almost opaque yet still clear dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate chestnut brown + cola brown + garnet red + ruby red colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a small to medium sized patch of wispy very thin film covering approximately 25% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edge of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + Rye over the top of slightly stronger than moderate aromas of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of toasted oak + vanilla.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of toasted oak + vanilla. Finally there are moderate to strong flavors of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + spicy Rye. No perceptible hop flavor is present and the booziness along with spiciness from the rye linger well through the finish.

M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with slightly heavier than moderate amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.

O: Drinks quite easily considering how big/strong ABV and intense this beer is and the alcohol is well hidden other than the warming feeling. Very enjoyable with lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas with tons of contribution from the different barrel treatments."
Double Double Cask,4.62,"So much going on in this one. Boozy, creamy and evolving taste. Bourbon, Cognac, caramel all in a smooth delivery and a clean finish. There may be too much going on but it is an adventure to drink and enjoy.
Pours medium brown with a thin white head that fades. Aroma is amazing, so complex with the aforementioned notes. Taste is also complex and somewhat overpowering, but in a good way. Feel is also excellent, creamy and clean. Overall, wow."
Double Double Cask,5,Oh wow!!!
Double Double Cask,4.41,"Extreme Beer selection and this was hands down the best beer in the box. For a beer pushing 16% this was an absolute pleasure to sip and enjoy.

Double Double Cask,4.64,"From the Extreme Beer selection, winter '22. Pours very dark brown, light head. Wonderful aroma, cognac and bourbon, of course. Taste is unbelievably complex, with layers of roasted grain, whiskey and top notch cognac. Not overly sweet, medium dry, very clean finish, not a fault anywhere. This could easily go with any steak in 5-star restaurant or as an after-dinner finish with the highest quality cheeses, fruits and Belgium chocolate."
Double Double Cask,4.19,"Appearance: Pours a murky burnt caramel color that is clear enough if you look at it carefully; the one finger beige head fades to a ringlet and archipelago while leaving a few spots behind

Smell: The Armagnac puncheon and Rye casks really show their influence on the aroma though there is Bourbon in the fold, as well; the expected Barleywine tones of caramel, raisin, spice cake and vanilla; there is a strong sweet cherry component, too

Taste: The brandied flavors of Armagnac hit the taste buds at the outset, with the cherry, raisin, caramel and spice cake flavors emerging; spicy Rye, vanilla and Bourbon tones emerge, in the middle, with the finish being sweet and boozy

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; considerable warmth in the gullet

Overall: A lot going on here, perhaps too much, as I don't think the Armagnac, Rye and Bourbon coalesce very well and I would prefer a bit more of a hop presence to balance out the sweet cherry tones - definitely extreme, though"
Double Double Cask,4.5,"One thing is for sure, there's booze in this here can. In both scent and flavor, the whiskey character is strong. There's a slight butterscotch flavor on the tail of the first few sips, which is unique. The body is quite smooth. In the end, the barrels shine, which is downright delicious."

I just wanted something huge to finish off with. Now, I'm drinking what climbed up to the 4th highest rated American Barleywine, and the 93rd highest rated beer overall on BA. That's absolutely wild for a fest-exclusive beer, and I couldn't be more excited to finally try this one. Let's get into it

This is very boozy in the nose, quite sweet for an American expression if the style. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, hot bourbon, raisin, sweet caramel, dark bread, and light vanilla

As I’m sipping this, I think it’s good, but not really as good as everyone else is making it out to be. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dates, molasses, brown sugar, earthy bourbon, vanilla, dark bread, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, earthy toffee, spicy whiskey, vanilla, light rye, raisin, and brown sugar

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry from the booze

Yeah so this was good, but I don’t think it was anything near what it was hyped up to be. I don’t think it was masterfully blended or anything but I enjoyed it"
Double Double Cask,4.34,"Can from the Extreme Beer Box. Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of mocha head heat sticks around, boozy lacing, smell is bourbon, chewy dark toffee, dark/burnt caramel, fudge, dried dates, tootsie roll, hints of vanilla, wood, and dirt/mulch, taste is incredibly smooth bourbon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, chewy molasses cookies, hints of creme brûlée and maple syrup, feel is full bodied, velvety smooth, mouth coating. Bourbon candy. Extr-yams."
Double Double Cask,4.46,"Canned 1/18/2022. 2nd to last from the 2022 Extreme box. Dark mahogany and brown, dense appearance, no head. Aroma of dark fruit/plum/nougat/fig and bourbon/rye barrel. Taste is right in line. Equal parts of many different flavors, sweet, and strangely easy drinking for the ABV. Feel is full, carbonation medium low. Overall, this may be my favorite bourbon barrel aged barley wine since the disappearance of a BCBBABW. Or whatever the acronym was."
Double Double Cask,4.85,"The crowned glory of the Awesome Extreme Beer Box 2022!
I could go on and on, but let’s just say this is the best Barleywine I’ve ever passed over my toungue. That’s a Big Statement because Barleywine and Stout are what I seek out! Well done!"
Double Double Cask,4.86,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours super dark brown - almost black. Very little head. Nose is just insane. Very nice Armagnac notes come through immediately. Super intense dark fruit. Super rich truffles, thick dark caramel, molasses, bourbon. The taste is absolutely crazy. Very very intense. Follows the nose very nicely. Rich toffee, chocolate, bourbon, Armagnac, figs, maple syrup, blackberries, red grapes, port, and a very slight roasted malts note. There is a very faint hint of pipe tobacco, but it's literally 1% of the taste. The best way to describe this is rich and robust. Sweet, but not cloying. The barrel influence is crazy. Very boozy, but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel is thick, but not really creamy. Overall, one of my favorite barleywines, and favorite beers, of all time."
Double Double Cask,4.03,"Look: Dark, syrupy with minimal to no head. Got some nice mahogany when holding up to light source.
Smell: Soy sauce. Boozy. Black licorice. Chewing tobacco (not dip…the good ol’ thick shredded chewing tobacco)

Taste: Chewing tobacco. Also getting some soy sauce and Robitussin cough syrup. Sweet and sticky. The booze is warm and comforting. As I worked through it, it started tasting more like a Cognac or Scotch.

Feel: Heavy body with medium low carbonation. Sticky.

Overall: In Winter with a fire and maybe Lord of the Rings on, this would be perfect."
Double Double Cask,4.69,"I enjoy sharing my extreme beer box contents with family & friends but this one, I set aside for myself only. Upon popping the top, the contents were eagerly awaiting release into a chalice. Dark, reddish brown color with with a thin head, it makes a somewhat boring appearance. It’s aroma promises some excitement, sweet & boozy with caramel, vanilla, maple & whiskey. It is sweet and, oh my, packed with flavor: brown sugar, caramel, vanilla & oak flavors, malt whiskey & rye. Silky smoot feel with low carbonation, no need for belching here. Mild mouth heat with more heat once it settles into the tummy. One of the best beers I’ve tasted, being selfish can sometimes be very rewarding."
Double Double Cask,4.49,Poured a deep brown color with an off white head on top. The smell of the beer has an abundant barrel aroma to it which is expected from something that's been aging in barrels for so long. The taste has a nice mixture of rich caramel and dark fruit notes. The feels is full bodied and has a smooth texture. Overall its an outstanding Barleywine. One of the best beers from the EBF boxes from all the years so far.
Double Double Cask,4.95,"Really enjoyed this one.

Nice malty, bourbon-tinged aroma.

Complex flavor, mixing caramel, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and dark fruit.

When I finished it, I wished I'd bought a second Extreme Beer Box (or that it was on the shelf locally so I could buy more).

Nice job by Kane Brewing on this."
Double Double Cask,4.75,"From the Extreme Beer Box & the best barleywine I've experienced. Incredibly rich deep reddish brown in color. Aroma is full, warm, bourbon, dark fruits with some sweetness of caramel. Taste is incredibly complex, balanced and smooth. Layered flavors of caramel, toffee, dark fruits, vanilla and bourbon. Mouthfeel is a traditional barleywine. Ranks among the best beers I've had the luck to taste."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.8,"341 ml bottle, from a Quebecois co-worker. ABV is 6.5%. Black colour, low tan head. Strong and pleasant aroma of cocoa and vanilla. The flavour is not very sweet, but has plenty of cocoa powder and vanilla, with strong coffee and bittering hops in the finish. No aphrodisiaque effect detected - maybe I am immune?"
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.15,"This is my new favourite stout among those that I can buy in my region. At $14 for 4 bottles it's so much better than I would have expected.
The look is pretty standard for a 7% ish abv stout. Dark black with brownish head that leaves a small amount of lacing.
The smell on this beer is great I didn't have a bottle opener when I tried it for the first time so I had to whack it on the counter and when some spilled there was this huge rush of vanilla, chocolate, and beautiful malt.
The taste does not quite follow the nose. The complex profile on the nose is lessened significantly when tasting. It is still very cool and the added flavours of vanilla and chocolate are done well enough. The vanilla comes up front but is subtle and the sweetness is balanced well by the roasted malt. The chocolate follows into the aftertaste and is again balanced well by the bitter coffee notes of the roasted malt.
The mouthfeel is pretty good. Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. Maybe a little more carbonation would be nice, but I like it.
Overall, I used"
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.92,"Appearance: Almost black brown
Smell: Malt, port, coffee
Taste: Coffee, vanilla, chocolate, dark dry fruits, malt
Mouthfeel: low carbonation
Overall: A tasty stout with pronounced flavours that complement each other well"
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.35,"Unknown vintage; drank on draft @ Hopleaf on 1/14/20.

Black appearance. Nice nitro head; strong, frothy lace.

Creamy vanilla, mild chocolate syrup & faint fresh earth notes in the nose.

Creamy, silky mouthfeel.

Creamy vanilla & mild milk chocolate flavors up front; faint fresh earth & faint hop bite notes on the finish.

Complex but easy to enjoy...I really liked this."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.91,"11.5oz twist off bottle labeled ""Aphrodite"" poured into a teku glass at just above fridge temp 6.5% ABV. Bottled on 2018-01-16 (21 months ago). The beer pours dense black with just a glimmer of brown highlight if held to light. The head is modest, mocha brown in color and settles to a thin ring and single layer of bubbles. Minimal lacing. The aroma is faintly sweet with the cocoa and vanilla present. The taste is surprisingly bitter up front with dark roasted malt first, chocolate second and vanilla nearly gone. The finish is less bitter and somewhat drying. The mouthfeel is medium to thin bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall, good. Not what I expected. Shame on Shelton Brothers for delivering an 18 month old beer to the store and shame on me for buying it. Definitely a pass at this age, this price (5.99) and stored warm. I'm giving some leeway in my numerical score and hoping to find this fresher in the future."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,2.58,"Served in a balloon glass at Las Buenas Pulgas. Black colour, small beige head with short retention. Small lacing. Not much aroma, some chocolate, roasted malts, coconut and a hint of vanilla. Medium to light body, thin texture, flat carbonation. Roasted finish. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's something I can't fiebre it out and I don't like. A bit of a deception to me."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,3.5,"The beer is fairly full-bodied, chocolate flavor and something a bit stronger nudges through--almost had a bourbon barrel aged quality. But the balance began to fall apart as the beer warmed. Some harshness, and surprising booziness for a 6.5%"
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.03,"L - black body, finger of almond head

S - Muted milk chocolate. Malty. Some coffee. Decent tobacco and licorice. Reminds me of GD Yeti.

T - More chocolate here. Lots of roasted malt.

F - Full

O - Its alright. Cocoa is ok, but no vanilla. Flavors are muted."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.35,"Pour is jet black, leaking to mahogany on the edges, with a rich tan head. There’s a stone fruit note on the nose at first, then dark chocolate and hops.

The taste is a flavor adventure: black cherries, dark chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and smoky char. This is exceptional, IMHO."
Aphrodisiaque / Aphrodite,4.2,"11.5 oz bottle from Albertsons. Pours out thick and black, small creamy beige head. Aroma is roast malts, burnt toast, ashy, chocolate. Subtle but rich. Taste begins with the roast malt bitterness, hints of dark chocolate, toasted marshmallows. Again very subtle. A little bitterness lingers, hint of sweetness. Creamy and smooth. Not a big beer in ABV, but huge in taste and feel."
Raspberry Tart,4.5,Not too sweet. A well-balanced beer.
Raspberry Tart,4.46,"This is a superb 'beer'. We test tasted this and all 4 of us loved it. Great color, nose and taste."
Raspberry Tart,3.83,"2021-12-03
12oz bottle served in a Cantillon glass. If there's a date, I don't know where to find it. Received from @WunderLlama.

Pours a clear but dark reddish purple, smallish head. Smell is raspberries.

Taste is raspberries. Raspberry jam. Maybe a slight tartness, but mostly very sweet.

Mouthfeel is medium, smooth. Maybe slightly sticky. Overall...it's pretty good. If you're looking for raspberry juice, it's very good."
Raspberry Tart,4.44,"Taster at share. Light pinkish pour, flat. Aroma and taste are raspberry jam, full, sweet. Absolutely gorgeous."
Raspberry Tart,4.71,"12oz bottle (no date, but I was told it was from 2021) served in a Libby globe porter glass.

Appearance: Clear purple-red-amber color. Thin off-white/pink ring of foam with an occasional island of lacing.

Smell: Raspberry, with a tiny bit of sour tang to it.

Taste: Nice tart rapspberry tempered with some sweetness, and a lingering fruity bitter/tart finish. Very nice!

Mouthfeel: Slick, a bit sticky, good carbonation. Dry finish.

Overall / Drinkability: This really is a great raspberry beer. I'd easily say this is a raspberry lambic, and a very well balanced one. Easily drinkable and I could pair this with a variety of desserts. I'm a bit surprised it's listed as a ""Fruit and Field"" beer given the character and the way the brewers make it. Well done and I definitely would want another."
Raspberry Tart,5,"All the sweetness and tartness you could possibly ask for in a fruited beer. New Glarus usually nails it, but their line up of fruit beers are totally our of this world good."
Raspberry Tart,3.88,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into my stemmed New Glarus glass. This beer, pours a dark red wine look with an inch and a half of raspberry colored foam that slowly settled back to a thin pink cap. When held up to the light, heavy amounts of carbonation can be observed.
The aroma is sweet raspberry jam.
Tart is the perfect description! There is tart raspberries with a sweet bubbly and tart again finish. The carbonation plays a big part in the taste and mouth feel.
This is not what I expect or crave from a beer. The taste is pleasant though."
Raspberry Tart,4.33,"Part of the midwestern milieu migrated my direction thanks to @FBarber in NBS BIF #13.

Rusty, plum juice red colour. Small wet head that quickly disappears leaving nothing but a few stray bubbles.

Nose has some sweet and tart of the raspberries that honestly kind of reminds me of marinara sauce. Ultimately beyond that there's deep aged berry aroma, like a raspberry wine.

Oooh man. Honestly, that's fucking delicious. It is raspberry juice. It is what it is. But I love raspberries. Late season berries, deep red, cool, just a touch of bramble tart. Jammy and delicious.

Moderate body I suppose, with a dry finish in contrast to the jammy berry carrying tool, and spicy/sharp/compressed carbonation.

I'll be honest. I love raspberry. And that strongly colours my review here. But that's an important component of it. New Glarus is really good at what they do. This beer is yet another NG brew that is blatantly competently composed, and in this case (as opposed to some of the other NG brews I've been fortunate enough to try), that happens to also align with a fruit expression that is right up my alley. This is easily my favourite of the New Glarus fruit beers I've tried, and now I'm sad I only have the one bottle.

Thanks Frank for sending it my direction! Cheers!"
Raspberry Tart,4.43,"Bottle poured into a new glarus stemmed glass

Fizzy off white foam two finger cap over a reddish brown cola liquid , settles to a thin layer

Aroma is tart raspberry jam

Taste is full flavored raspberries, sweet tart,

Medium sudsing , raspberry taste lingers, sweet tart

Good beer"
Raspberry Tart,4.67,"Pours beautiful red color with quickly dissipating pinkish head. The smell is sweet and fruity that I hesitate to identify as a raspberry. The taste is a perfect combination of fruity sweetness and tartness. Again, I hesitate to unequivocally define it as a raspberry. The body is medium-light, but never feels thin. Overall - great from the first to the last sip."
Raspberry Tart,4.37,"Poured very dark red color, smallish off-red head, dissipates quickly. Huge raspberry aroma and flavor, sweetish finish."
Society & Solitude #5,4.5,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, Vermont for twenty dollars. My seventeenth brew from these guys. Excellent, liked better than # 6."
Society & Solitude #5,4.5,"Canned 8/16/22.

L: Pours a hazy gold with a short white head that slowly thins. Large bubbles on the cap. The lacing is gorgeous.

S: Aromas of grapefruit and pine.

T: Tropical fruit up front, then pink grapefruit. Finishes slightly dry but not bitter.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Slightly less than medium carbonation.

O: The taste is a spectacular tropical/citrus fruit combo, delicately balanced so that all flavors stand out, but none overwhelm."
Society & Solitude #5,4.65,One of the smoother to drink S&S. High alcohol content but very accessible. Easy to drink and goes down very easy. Not too heavy.
Society & Solitude #5,4.38,"L: Hazy yellow with an orange tint to it. Nice fluffy head and good lacing.

S: Tropical fruits, pine resin, peach, candied malt.

T: Moderate bitterness upfront, big juicy fruit character follows. Mango, papaya, peach and a resinous pine character. The malt adds some sweetness enhancing the juiciness of the beer.

F: Full bodied, but drying on the finish.

Overall: A superb DIPA, just your average Hill Farmstead hoppy brew. You really can't go wrong with these guys."

It’s very pretty for a beer. The perfect Instagram shot can be has for anyone with this given it’s bright colors. There’s a little lacing that stays around. I don’t get as much on the nose as I’d like from the absolute favorite IPAs I’ve had. It smells grapefruit zesty and you get that on the tongue. The beer shines through in its bitter balance with sweetness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Why do they make these in only 12oz cans!! My favorite Hop Butcher IPAs often have a softer mouthfeel than this guy, but this is still wonderful. Wow, a great IPA and so glad to be able to have some. Would never pass on it."
Double Barrel Jesus,4.75,"2015 bomber into a tulip
About as pretty a beer as I’ve ever seen. Pitch black with a 1-finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing.

Nose is roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. On the palate- more roast and much heat followed by a long oaky finish. Huge body. Thick and creamy. Great old school big BBA stout.

240th beer on the BA Top 250. Surprisingly hard to track down."
Double Barrel Jesus,5,"I tried this alongside my previous favorite beer - the Evil Twin Aún Más A Jesús. This was clearly better. Unfortunately, I tasted close to 20 other top rated beers that day, and I didn't take any notes for a thorough review. But I know my scoring is accurate, as this and the Aún Más A Jesús were the first two beers I tasted that night. To me, this is the best of the best."
Double Barrel Jesus,3.92,"2016 vintage; drank 2/24/17 @ the Yarchives.

Motor oil black appearance.

Minimal tan head; no lace.

Marshmallow, milk chocolate, cognac & mild oak notes in the nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Whiskey & fudge flavors up front; marshmallow & oak notes on the finish.

Bold flavors here, but it was a hint too boozy for me to love. Close but not quite great."
Black Butte Porter,3.34,"Nice dark brown pour, big khaki head, to much for a glass of Coke, otherwise, nails it. Severely lacking in treats for the nose, some mild coffee aroma, taste buds say roasted malt, a bit of cocoa. It seems thin for the style, carbonation seemed ok.

This was purchased as part of a ""pick six"" and has some age, canned 1/26/22, if I see it fresh, I'll update."
Black Butte Porter,4.2,"Purchased at Fresh, in Tyler TX. Warmed in hands from fridge for ~30-60 sec. Poured into stein glass

Appearance:
Dark cola color with 2-3 inch, tan head

Nose:
Toasty aroma, with notes of cocoa, raisin, and spiced rum

Taste:
Initially, dark, burnt, and bitter. As the beer warmed, the bitter taste moved to the back end and notes of spiced rum and raisin, with a light sweetness. Milder bitterness on the back end.

Mouthfeel:
Initially thin, with fine effervescence. As the beer warmed, mouthfeel gained a small degree of body, but not significantly. About as expected for a 5.5% ABV beer.

Overall:
As someone who usually drinks brown, amber, or scotch ale, this was definitely outside my usual and, previously, I haven't had the best of experiences with stouts or porters. That being said, this was a darn good porter and one I would drink again!"
Black Butte Porter,4.31,"A classic standby. Looks great, and tastes great. Loads of chocolate and coffee, some dark fruits and caramel. Licorice, and a hint of vanilla. The finish is charred toast and hop resin. The mouthfeel borders on thin, but it still has a nice creaminess, and the dry finish is very pleasant. It's well balanced, and very drinkable all year round.

The aroma is subdued, but it's hot in Texas, so I'm having it cold (usually drink these at room temp). I know from experience that the nose is much livelier at room temp (though still not as lively as the palate)."
Black Butte Porter,3.18,"noted from journal (2015-2016): brown head, black body, smells like chocolate, roasted flavor with a hoppy finish, thick almost a pilsner finish

**Definite try again candidate after 7-8 years"
Black Butte Porter,4.2,Solid dark beer that is memorable. Definitely my favorite choice outside of the trendy IPAs. Guinness does not compare!
Black Butte Porter,4.27,"Brighton, Co:
LOOK: Pours an opaque darkest of brown to black color with an easy to pour 3b finger tan or light brown head that slowly fades but has overall good retention as well as lacing.
AROMA: Same roasted malts, bakers chocolate and cocoa.
TASTE: Again you get the roasted malts, bitter sweetness. Has a little smoky aftertaste.
Creamy and easy drinking."
Black Butte Porter,4.25,"For some reason I thought I had rated this one years ago. Apparently not.

Pours extremely dark brown, nearly black, with a nice fluffy cola head. Good lacing.

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, licorice, and some yeast.

The flavors follow the nose and that's just fine. Dark and semi-sweet chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, licorice, buttermilk and dark fruit (cherry) sourness, astringent roastiness at the finish.

Medium bodied. Incredibly drinkable for such a dark brew, owing to plenty of carbonation and a fairly drying finish.

Are there better American Porters? Sure. But at this price point and availability level? Nope. Wanna show someone the difference between a stout and a porter? This might be the perfect brew."
Black Butte Porter,4.25,"Good American porter! Flavors: coffee, chocolate, slightly sweet. Would drink again."
Black Butte Porter,4.02,2/11/22 Pitch black with a nice tan head. Roasted / burnt malt carries the day here. Some light coffee bitterness. Low ABV. Well balanced. Will add to the rotation.
Black Butte Porter,3.86,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my spiegelau stout glass.

It looks like Guinness (co2) on the pour which I'd say is a good thing. Those big beers usually seem to be pretty good looking. 1.5 finger head that fades to a decent covering of head. Almost pitch black but at the bottom of the glass you can see it's a dark brow color where some light can get through.

Smell is full and quite strong with some rosty malts shining through, but there is quite a bit of fermentation character here, mostly just the smell of ale yeast bit it is quite strong. Not a lot more going on here but it's very malt forward and seems quite strong.

On my first sip it's quite dry and decently bitter. Once again some of those roasty malts are hanging in the back. Quite a lot of that ale character is up front. Slight tartness coming from fermentation as well it seems. Not a british flavor here, but despite the american yeast, hops arent all that present here. Maybe some for bittering cause it has a higher ibu than a porter or stout from the UK, but it seems to be a very malt forward american porter. Good but could be a bit more balanced. As I drink the bitterness becomes less pronounced and the malts shine more and more.

Feel is quite smooth and creamy, not a lot of carbonation bit but it's there. Easy to put down but still rich like chocolate. Could be dangerous if it was less pricey but I like it.

Overall a decent day porter. I wish there was a bit more sweetness from the malt but that's just taste. It does seem a bit dry for a porter but the roasty dark malts shine nicely here."

Smell: Roasted malt, dark fruit, and a hint of smoke.

Taste: Charred malt, slight smoke, and a bitter bite with a finish to match. Also had a generic ""beer"" taste that was a little too prevalent for me.

Feel: Relatively smooth, medium carbonation.

Overall: Something I appreciated experiencing but can't see myself getting again. The bitterness and generic ""beer"" taste turned me off to it."

L - Clear motor oil black with a sticky dark khaki head measuring two fingers. Excellent lacing, but rather poor head retention.
S - Funny enough, bubblegum is present and fairly upfront. Turbinado sugar and molasses follow closely, with hints of dark wheat and cacao.
T - Bauernbrot and slight bubblegum fade into a deep baker's chocolate and creamy ristretto espresso. Bittersweet and well-balanced. The finish is a bright molasses and French-roast coffee with chicory.
F - Creamy and easy-to-drink. Filling. Full-bodied with very light carbonation.
O - A great campfire beer! A complex (but not too complex) entry-level porter that's easy on the wallet. This is now one of my favorite brews. I highly recommend this, and will purchase a six-pack if I can find it."
Black Butte Porter,2.57,"One of those days where one (very sub-par) beer wasn't enough. No real head formed as it went into the glass. The weak (or maybe my sense of smell is going today) scent was of root beer, Bazooka bubble gum (do they still make that anymore) with a touch of citrus. It was definitely dark, though more molasses than black and almost as opaque. A buttery feel in the mouth followed by some carbonation as it slid down my throat. In between, a slightly smoky, cherry coffee? I guess... that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The aftertaste is a bit like bitter coffee dregs with a little too much sweet'n'low. 0 for 2 tonight and I'm out of beer and it is past beer's bedtime in the stores."
Black Butte Porter,3.98,"Solid black appearance. Slightly thin body with about average carbonation.
Aroma is molasses, malt,dark fruit,dark chocolate with just a bit of coffee.

Overall my description isn't doing this beer justice. Its a really well done beer that I would look for again."

Society & Solitude #4,4.44,"Just a banger of an IPA - very refined - very balanced; no real hint of overpowering bitterness. Just a smooth clean, clean, flavorful hop bite that makes these far too easy to drink at 8%. Which isn't a bad thing. Great beer."
Society & Solitude #4,4.88,"I’ve been fortunate to have tried some of the best ipas. This #4 is truly refined, smooth. Perfect for a toast!

The smell is so so lively, like bursting out of the glass. Super pungent peach, citrus, also hints of tropical fruits.

The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers.

This beer has a medium body but it is such a soft and pleasant beer to drink. Semi dry finish with a medium bitterness that goes down so smooth and clean."

90 Minute IPA,3.9,"Appearance: Pours a rich, golden reddish amber color, with a thick white foam head. Good retention and leaves behind some sticky lacing.

Aroma: Sweet bready malt and pine. A subtle touch of citric fruit.

Taste. A pronounced maltiness followed by hoppy layers of citrus and pine. Some bready biscuit notes. Malt backbone and a bitterness that starts half-way through, and rides all the way to the end. Finishes fairly clean.

Overall: This is one interesting, well balanced beer."
90 Minute IPA,4.35,"First review here goes.
Glassware used - Lagunitas pint glass
Appearance- pours an amber color with a 1 finger foam head.

Smells sweetly like of caramel and apples.

Taste- taste of malt and breadiness fades Into a minimally bitter finish."
90 Minute IPA,4.73,"Something they did with the hops and the malt... the BITTER is SWEET. Like, simultaneously. They are one.
Poured from can into my lucky pint glass and paired with cooked-from-frozen orange chicken.
Amber colored with 3-finger, long-lived foamy off-white head. Smells lemony-piney, reminds me of Murphy's Oil Soap... that's a compliment, I promise, I used to be a housekeeper. Precisely zero complaints on look, smell, or taste. I do wish the foam would cut it out a little so I wasn't getting half a mouthful of it every sip, but you can't win 'em all. It is very pretty, at least. Top notch IPA."
90 Minute IPA,2.6,"So bitter! Also, the color looks off and the bubbles are too small. I understand this is highly rated but it is not to my liking. Beer buyer beware!"
90 Minute IPA,4.17,"Look: Rich amber-red with a formidable eggshell head that erupts on the pour and holds as a pillow, slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Pine needles and sap, grapefruit, fir needles, orange, raw hop cones, and some bready malt
Taste: Starts out with layers of pine and hop cones that pile on one another for prominence and followed by nice notes of freshly baked bread. Citrus fruits peek in once the conifer barrage settles down and mixes in before pine and fir return for the close
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, and a decently dry finish with zero hint of the ABV
Overall: This is good stuff and a classic. One of the first DIPA’s I had 15+ years ago and cool that they still make it and in stovepipe cans to boot. C-hops are prominent and the strong malt presence showcases this as an old-school DIPA, which I like. Tasty and fun to try again after many years"
90 Minute IPA,4.17,Just a classic. Really great continuous hopping for a bitter and delicious IPA.
90 Minute IPA,4.71,"Poured out as a copperish color with a foamy head that slowly subsides.
The smell is of malt plus a nice hoppy aroma.
The taste is that of malt, hops, and what you expect from an IPA - Imperial.
Definitely one that I will be getting again."
90 Minute IPA,4.23,"12 oz bottle from a 6 pack. Right fine IPA. Balanced bitter & malt. It’s got the look, the pungent aroma that non-IPA people hate, a nice long finish. Recycle. Repeat."
90 Minute IPA,4.35,"Looks and smells good. What matters most is taste and this is not a light weight, which it isn't supposed to be. Heavy on the malt would be only criticism. Almost prefer the 60 minute if only because I can drink two in succession and save some calories, which you can do with this 90, however two of these and that ends the session for me."
90 Minute IPA,4.83,Great IPA. The hype did not disappoint.
90 Minute IPA,4.26,"Large format 19oz. can with NOV 2022 stamped on the bottom.
This pours a beautiful, medium orange-amber color, gloriously clear with a tall head of off-white that peppered the glass with lace.
The aroma is less than I remember - more citrus than 20 years ago and less malt sweetness in the nose. Some caramel and grain notes are there but not the blast of scents this had when produced, in smaller, more lovingly made batches.
As it warms and I swirl, more floral hops come forward as well as some more grainy wort.
Flavor is much better than expected - not as rich and malty as I recall but firm in it's malt character if a bit less balanced.
Hop flavors from mid/constant boil seem less, this that when it first came out defined the term ""juicy"" for beer.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin but just fine for style and maybe the only improvement over the first few years when it was a bit on the heavy side.
Finish is mildly and pleasantly alcoholic complimented by lingering grassy hop flavors and bitterness.
This still has good balance and hop flavor w/out sacrificing malt character. Not bad for a big batch beer.
A previous reviewer said "" Old school goodness"". I couldn't agree more."
90 Minute IPA,4.51,"Amber, with good clarity. Head pours moderately thick (about a finger), and is an off-white eggshell color. Fade to a persistent cap with little lacing.

Aroma is initially malt. Thick, sugary barley. Floral hops, sweet pine, lime peel, then toffee. Going back in, I get grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin oranges.

On the palate, it's thick, sweet malt. Toffee, caramel, sugar, dried fruit, and candied orange peel. Sweet piney resin. Lasting bitterness. This is about as close as you get to a barleywine without crossing over.

The taste and aroma continue to evolve as it warms. The malt becomes more prominent, but it always finishes with a pleasant piney bitterness. Overall, this is a delicious beer that is right up my alley. I love that orange hop flavor coupled with thick barley malt."
90 Minute IPA,3.58,"Clear orange amber brew is quite handsome in the tall goblet with abundant foam. Hugely hoppy and quite bitter, but not too unpleasant. Interesting dark roasted malty taste. Grapefruit and piney hops.

Distinctive woody taste. Just the thing to hop up some Blonde Ale I am stuck with. From the 19.325 oz can. A massive amount of this strong beer for a few bucks at a nondescript southern California liquor store. Dated AUG 2022, hopefully a ""drink by"" date."
90 Minute IPA,4.26,"A really good IPA, not crushable, tastes very good. A lot of calories though"
90 Minute IPA,4.5,Tastes a bit like cream soda
90 Minute IPA,4.5,"Strong malt smell with some sweet chocolate. Taste is malt dominant with a mix of sweet chocolate, hops & some light citrus. This is a quality brew that tastes great!"
90 Minute IPA,3.98,1-2 of these and you'll be good! Great beer for all the hops lovers!
90 Minute IPA,4.29,"12oz can best by date June 2022 into a pint glass.
L: Pours almost crystal clear amber w/a 1"" pock marked creamy off white head w/decent retention to a creamy skin. Random lacing and some sticky sheeting.
S: Caramelized malts, grassy hops, orange zest, a hint of bread. It is pungent, fruity & floral.
T: Citrus zest, black tea, caramelized roasty malts, grapefruit, fruit cake, grassy hops, lemon drop candy, a suggestion of brown bread, moderate alcohol. It is somewhat tart w/pine resin in a med-long linger. Powerful malts, bold hops and is full flavored.
F: Sharp, firm & smooth med-heavy bodied mouth feel that is lightly sticky and almost thick. It has a rather drying finish.
O: A full flavored American Imperial IPA that truly delivers an enthusiastic and unrestrained dense punch of malts & hops. It's taste is BIG and it is excellent in it's style."
90 Minute IPA,3.4,Wouldn’t turn it down but…I’ve had better
90 Minute IPA,4.41,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IP Glass. Two finger off-white head. Pours golden and hazy. Decent lacing.

S - Bitter citrus and floral IPA scent

T - Taste is more complex than scent. Has some maltiness to balance the bitter floral and citrus. Very balanced for an IPA. Each taste goes back and forth between malt and hop.

F - Nice medium oily feel.

O - Top notch IPA. Drank the same night as 60 Min IPA. Both are wonderful beers that are definitely in my annual rotation. The 60 Minute is the IPA standard for me. This 90 Minute is a great premium version with more complexity."
90 Minute IPA,4.35,"Best by Jul 2022. Drinking feb 24 2022. Room temperature.

L: amber body, off white 2 finger head that becomes a ring. Good lacing.

S: mostly tropical fruit, some pine, a hint of malt.

T: a nice piney bitterness, grapefruit tartness, a touch of sweetness, and a bittersweet hoppy roasted malt finish.

F: a full viscous body, similar to a good barrel aged stout. Creamy and coats the tongue. Beautiful execution for a dipa.

O: an above average ipa in every aspect. The mouth feel was my favorite part, but there were no major weaknesses. Definitely a better ipa for malt centric beer lovers. Probably better options out there if you like pine sol flavored beer."
Haze,4.43,"Not quite on par with the other TH offerings I've been lucky to sample recently, but a very well-executed NEIPA nonetheless. Very smooth and minimal bitterness as are the hallmarks of the style. Glad to have had several of these gifted."
Haze,4.6,"Canned 7/18/22

Pours cloudy, juicy, deep orange with a lovely white, billowing head, and smells of bright citrus fruits - mandarin, grapefruit, and I also get a tinge of melon.

The taste follows with a bright explosion of orange, papaya, and tangerine, coupled with a silky smooth mouthfeel. A great sipper."

$17.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.
Review #7,975"
Haze,3.59,"Lovely golden orange body; cloudy; thick head, white and sculpted and long lasting. An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.

All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

Pouring temperature: 40 °F; canning data: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE 03/16/22"
Haze,4.81,"Very smooth double, heavy juice offering. Praise the hops."
Haze,4.93,"I have been drinking IPA's for at least ten years now and a friend gave me this after helping him with repair work around his house. I don't need to rate this with regards to taste, smell, mouth feel.... As soon as I took the first pull, I can tell you it was one of (if not the best) IPA's I've ever had. The combinations of fruit notes are extraordinary and once you give yourself a chance to absorb the flavors, you'll understand what I mean. Drink this Beer!!!"
Haze,4.13,"16oz can at share. Hazy orange golden pour with a small foamy white head. Aroma is stone fruit with light tropical acents. Sweet, fruity taste, mango, peaches, zesty, smooth."
Haze,4.56,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a light hazy orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters visible.

Smell: Sweet orange and tangerine combined with tropical notes of papaya as well as some peach.

Taste: Orange, tangerine and grapefruit, also peach and papaya. Ripe, but not overripe. Medium sweetness, medium zestiness and a slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Very juicy. Generally smooth with nuanced sharp notes.

Overall: Beautifully balanced beer with a soft fruity body and some edges. While Very Hazy and Very Hhhazyyy were a bit to sharp for my taste, this one just hits the spot."
Haze,4.42,"Had the perfect excuse to visit the treehouse this past weekend. Was meeting up with a friend in Western, MA before conquering the slopes in Vermont. This is an absolute dream of a tailgate beer. I have only had Haze one other time, the Brady return game to Foxboro when we were pleasantly surprised that Tree House was being sold in the stadium. My goodness, what a delicious liquid. Massive citrus nose with grapefruit notes and several other tropical flavors. Taking one of these down after a few runs was an absolute dream. Refreshing and smooth. And, yes, I brought a glass for the tailgate. Veteran move."
Haze,4.27,"Impressive dome head which never recedes completely. Excellent lacing with a variety of streaks and spots. The liquid is cloudy with a dirty gold appearance.

Grapefruit rind aroma along with some green vegetal/fresh cut grass notes. The malt is hard to tease out, but I would say it's closest to light wheat bread.

There's a berry sweetness up front. Richer body with a neutral level of carbonation. The hop is pronounced but not overwhelming. It's closer to black pepper with a notable alcohol warmth in the swallow. The sweetness returns in the aftertaste, but dissipates first leaving the peppery finish."
Haze,4.21,"So maybe I made mistake of having very hazy first, but this one, while good, is so much like hundreds of other neipa's I have had. Murky darker yellow hazy body with a huge white head, spotted lacing. Big grapefruit and citrus with light pineapple lead the nose. Taste is much the same, some tangerine additions are nice. Body is medium-light with decent brightness and smoothness, not the most lush neipa ever. Does hide the abv very well"
Haze,4.27,"Pours a fairly light straw color, perfect foamy white head. Aroma is citrusy, grassy, earthy, slightly dank. Flavor is sharp citrus, lemon candy, spicy grapefruit pith. Creamy texture with ample bitterness throughout and a pretty dry finish. Overall a tasty brew, but there are a lot of other TH ipa’s that I prefer.

Haze,4.46,"A - Pours a beautiful golden orange with a thin white head. Good amount of soapy lacing.

S - Aroma is mango, peach and papaya.

T - The taste is mango, papaya, peach, orange peel and a nice lingering grassy bitter hop bite.

M - Medium body with medium carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice crisp finish.

O - Very well made DIPA."
Haze,4.37,I prefer this to Julius and Green. Its just perfection.
Kentuckley,4.39,"2022 on tap. Weller barrels. Dark brown color, nearing black.

Is it a bit thinner for a ba stout? Sure. Does it have a ton of flavor, yes. The maple and coffee blend together for an awesome breakfast flavor. Sweet, not overly roasted. Vanilla and chocolate cake mixed in. Nice warming bourbon all throughout. This was a big surprise. I know it’s rated well, but just didn’t expect so much balanced flavors and drinkability. Big fan here."
Kentuckley,4.45,"Tar black body; very fizzy carbonation; thin, patchy, brown head. Rich, roasted and charred grain aroma; heavy chocolate presence; cocoa. Immense dark malt sweetness greets the palate; milk chocolate; coffee and caffeine; bourbon tones bleed midway through the malt sweetness and linger through the finish. Heavy body; dense, sticky residual sugars; huge alcohol warmth permeates through the density.

The initial appearance makes you think this is just another heavy-duty barrel-aged imperial stout. Distinction begins with the aroma, announces itself with the taste, and is undeniable with the incredible mouthfeel. An amazing stout!

Pouring temperature: 43 °F; bottling info: 2021 Vintage"
Kentuckley,4.26,"Brief Review:

O: First Transient review for me I believe. Never really got into these guys as I'm more old school. But they're really making a name for themselves with the -uckley series with 2 of them in the Top 250 now. Most recent 2021 edition here, haven't seen 2022's yet. This one comes a bit hot for me. Little boozy and tingly on the tongue. Aroma is a little suppressed. Reminds me a bit of Vanilla Noir from Prairie if it had some maple syrup in it. Otherwise the pour and mouthfeel are nice and slick, which is impressive. It's a darn good beer, not gonna lie, but maybe not world-class for me right now.

Recommendation: Decent offering from Transient here. They make a ton of BA stuff with lots of variants, so hard to get anything to stand out."
Kentuckley,4.49,2020 version. No carbination. Very thicc. Nice feel with a light alcohol burn on the back end. Very well done brew.
Kentuckley,4.66,"A beer that is somehow powerful yet subtle at the same time. Mild dark tan lacing. Scents of coffee, vanilla, and bourbon, mild maple syrup notes. Taste delivers all of those flavors, with a stronger maple presence. Big bodied, a bit syrupy and thick, but not oily, a pleasant booze burn on the back end. Damn good."

Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.49,"Whale hunting

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring

Aroma is cocoa, brown sugar, bourbon, and yes brownie batter

Taste is bourbon, cocoa, brownies, coffee

Fizzy mouthfeel , rich, decadent , 13.8% abv, this is a sipper

Good beer"
Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.27,2021 version poured into a KBBS tulip glass. There was less coffee and more sweetness in this than I had hoped or anticipated. Not particularly thick.
Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.33,Thin and overrated. Most of Trillium's barrel-aged stouts taste the same. This one uses the same base stout as all of the others and tries to cover up the flaws with lots of sugar.

A- pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the glass

S- an array of spices on the nose, with cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg sticking out. Earthy espresso and mocha chocolate undertones, along with molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and nutty roasted malts. Undertones of green pepper skin and bourbon

T- spice notes of cinnamon up front is quickly followed by notes of rich espresso and mocha cream, along with vanilla and caramel. Mid-palate brings out undertones of ginger and nutmeg, along with more cinnamon, raw pepper skin and chocolate icing. The finish gives bourbon and vanilla, with a linger of coffee, chocolate, cinnamon and pepper

M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into a warming finish

O- all of the adjuncts are in check and the barrel aging adds even more complexity, very good"

B- / WORTHY"
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.75,"Merry Christmas to Me! My local beer store had some earlier vintage bottles on sale for... wait for it...2.99 a bottle! Bought them all up. This stout has aged very well and delivers a spicy pop on the backside. It pours thick like oil and delivers notes of coffee, chocolate, gingerbread, vanilla and molasses. This is a very fine Christmas stout - it delivers big on the ABV and flavor,and every mouthful is as complex and wonderful as the holiday season itself!"
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.5,"Pours black with half a finger of dark caramel colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is rich and full roasty and toasty malts with caramely, nutty and bready malts adding a little further depth and complexity. Molasses, chocolate, spices, bourbon and oak add a little further depth and complexity, balancing out the initial malts with a little sweetness and heat, respectively. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, nutty, bready malts for a firm, thick stout base. Spices, cinnamon, molasses, chocolate and toffee add a little dry sweetness that gets rinsed away by a touch of bourbon heat and oaky char. Mouth feel is thick and full with a chewy, lightly grainy texture. Overall, rich and full with a light spice character to add further depth to the otherwise clean and straightforward barrel aged stout. It's complex and full, with a big surprise in every sip.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 12oz bottle."
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.91,"12 oz bottle at Tulsa brewpub. No to-go, just drink here.

Silky black with a minimal bubbly head.

Aroma of huge spices and hot fudge, with emphasis on nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon, but with extended depth and oak sweetness. Slightly coffee, with coconut and more fudge.

The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic.

Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too.

Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain. THAT IS TRUE BEER!!! I would have to have Apple Brandy Noir side-by-side to compare, but this may be the best Prairie beer ever made."
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.49,"If the emperor gets to wear new clothes then this king of stouts dons its Christmas attire! This time enveloped in bourbon drenched Santa suit, the flavors of the Christmas Bomb! imperial stout are brought to the palate with generous additions of holiday spice and the warmth of the bourbon barrel.

Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.

Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.

Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form."
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,4.75,"Smells and tastes like Christmas cookies and Whiskey. Big aromas and flavors of cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla. Mouthfeel is velvety, and it finishes sweet, boozy, and slightly drying. Perfect holiday dessert beer."

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind

S- aroma is rich with chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper up front, followed by undertones of creamy lactose, vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. The tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma, with some oaky bourbon juice in the background

T- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. Mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage, with some oaky bourbon complimenting. The finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate, with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose

M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. Some pepper heat pokes through after the finish

O- the barrel combo works well with this one, well done"
Leche Borracho,4.56,"Brew: Bottle Logic Brewing – Leche Borracho

Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank

Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.

Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel

Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic

Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score given"
Leche Borracho,4.9,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer."
Leche Borracho,4.37,"2018 bottling. Poured from fridge temp on 7.13.2020

Pours dark, minimal head. Nose was well blended ancho, mild cinnamon, chocolate, and bourbon barrel. Taste was well blended between the ancho, cinnamon, and got more tiquilla than bourbon on the taste. Slightly thin for style but made it easy to drink. Overall solid Mexican stout from bottle logic"
Leche Borracho,4.5,2018 version poured into a snifter. The peppers are not overpowering but do provide some heat in the finish. Cinnamon is very up front in aroma. I don't typically seek out beers that contain peppers but this is pretty tasty.
Leche Borracho,3.56,"A big fan of BL, and chili stouts but this missed the mark. Great smell with some nice chili heat spice but taste spice is really hidden and out of place, mouthfeel is thin slick"
Leche Borracho,4.49,"On tap at Hollingshead’s in Orange, CA.

Oh my sweet hell, like, Raul... Umm, hell! I mean, this thing is devilish. Did the Tasmanian devil get into the beer business? Cuz this one is firing on all cylinders like Cheney shooting a shotgun!

L: from the can - stylish.
S: sweet, pine
T: lots of hoppy notes crashing through. piney, bitterness. boozy
F: rich and smooth
O: it's a winner - belongs in your rotation if you like this style."
Maharaja,4.1,"Pours a rich dark gold with ample head. Smells fruity, herbal and hoppy. The taste is grapefruit, orange, lemon, piney, and pretty bitter on the back end but it’s a mostly good finish. This is a dry, hoppy, strong DIPA that is more than serviceable for the price, cheers!"
Maharaja,4.89,This is an amazing beer. I have no idea why the named it after the official beer from India. The Indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. This is a man's beer. Fruity mango. Nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. Love it. Get it if you can
Maharaja,3.66,"Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer. I could drink 2 of these in a row without feeling like I've over done it, which is rare with me and DIPAs. If you see it on draft get yourself a pull but I don't see myself buying a four pack of this."

Maharaja,4.42,"12 ounce can poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Canned on 5/7/21, so fresh enough for me.

L---Opaque amber color with a two finger khaki head that had very good retention and left amazing lace.

S---Hoppy. Lemon, orange, mango. Light pine.

T---Follows the nose, but stronger. Somehow manages to hide the alcohol. Really nice stuff.

F---Medium/full body. Nice carbonation. No alcohol burn.

O---Really good beer. I will get this any time I see it."
Maharaja,4.29,"The color is a beautiful dark gold that lightens slightly at the top of the glass. Head is nicely developed and remains on edges of glass well after pour. I was surprised by the smell— sweet for an imperial, with mango and pineapple immediately, along with a twinge of dank hops. The taste is big and complex. Sweet at first, with the mango and pineapple, becoming floral pine and bready malt, finishing moderately dank and bitter. The 10% is apparent after a few sips. Feel is wonderfully creamy, soft, and wet, which seems to balance the big flavor and ABV.
I can’t say huge IPAs are my favorite, but this beer does everything so well I can’t help but appreciate it. I’d love to have it fresh on tap sometime."
Maharaja,3.26,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. OG 1090, ABV 10.41%. 102 IBU. Orange colour, big off-white head with an orangey hue. Strong sweetish aroma with notes of tropical fruits, citrus and pine, very nice. The flavour is sweet, alcoholic and dominated by an absurd amount of American hops from start to finish. Unbalanced. Another example of ""overkill""."
Maharaja,4.16,"Im giving this 4 cuz I love Avery but I need to have this again for sure. It was good but I tasted the alcohol a lot. This has such a high reputation though so if you're feeling it you should see for yourself.


UPDATE!!! Much better the second time around, im not really tasting the alcohol like before. Much better experience"
Maharaja,3.82,"~80 Days old when opened (canned on 12/16/2020)

A: Deep copper orange with significant haze without being murky
S: Nice aroma of dank green pine with wafts of citrus. Noticeable strong malt tying it all together
T: intense dank resin that brightens towards citrus zest. Strong bitter carried by sappy honey
Mf: hefty but deceiving given the abv
Overall: pretty intense but focuses a complex hop profile nicely. this particular can is not very fresh, so I can imagine a much better hop experience closer to the canning date"

Feel nice carbonation and served around 40 degrees .
Overall this beer is excellent and has nice Heft! Not watered down. I will be serving this to my friends, neighbors and relatives over the holidays or as gifts !"
Maharaja,3.52,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a nice foamy light tan head of 1F sits on a golden orange tinged beer with about 80% transparency.

The nose is floral, bready, light grapefruit and pine.

I taste lightly sweet malt with grapefruit and alcohol with pithy hop dryness. I also get some pine and a bit of sulfur and a hint of thymol (Listerine note). This is not nearly as dark and dank as Avery describes. It is not too bitter but rather presents too much of a sharp alcohol character.

Mouthfeel is slick and medium bodied with drying astringency and alcohol. Very light carbonation and a hint of metallic tang.

I am glad I got to try this beer. The beer did not taste super hoppy unless it is those ""off"" notes of thymol and pine resin mixed with alcohol that is just not doing it for me. It is certainly drinkable and interesting but I don't think I would buy it again as I prefer Odell Myrcenary quite a bit more."
Art,4.41,"B7/2016 bottling, bottle pour onsight, 15cl into tulip

Blåbær Lambik,4.35,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.

Blåbær Lambik,4.56,"2019, 375ml. Poured a deep hazy, purple-red color. The nose is fruity and funky. So funky it can start to smell like a bleu cheese. Taste is blueberry, with barn funk and had hay. The blueberry is light but not subdued. It plays well with the signature Cantillon funk. Mouth feel is light and perfectly carbonated. Overall, it was incredible and worth the hype. Cantillon makes plenty of great beers and Blabaer is among the top."
Blåbær Lambik,4.8,"I have to admit this Lambik was difficult to attain and I had to pay. However, it was truly delicious. It was among the best Lambics, if not the best Lambic, that I've ever had.

Abrasive Ale
Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing."
Abrasive Ale,4.19,"Pours a light chill haze pale yellow, nice white head laces very well.

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.

Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.

Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.

Overall a solid big IPA."
Abrasive Ale,4.49,"This was a wonderful throwback IIPA, with a heavy dollop of bitterness along with the grapefruit, melon, and tangerine hop flavors. Body is phenomenally crisp and drinkable given the high ABV. Wholly worthy of its lofty reputation, and well worth a repeat visit - frequently, if at all possible."
Abrasive Ale,4.5,Kinda a wishy washiy color but that was the only close to negative part of a review I could come up with. And I am never looking for negative stuff anyway. Great beer from a fine brewery. I got a 4 pk from my Total Wine here in the Daytona area and am glad they had it for sure. Limited somewhat but maybe I can sneak over there agian tomorrow and pick up another 4 pack. Well worth it.
Abrasive Ale,4.43,Excellent DIPA! Smooth mouth feel and due to balance is mildly bitter. Highly recommended!

Abrasive Ale,4.46,"Canned 11/11/20 enjoyed 5/21/21 so not the freshest, but that's on me.

Pours hazy yellow with a medium white head that lasts. Aroma is tropical fruit and some dank hoppy notes. Taste a complex mix of hop floral bitterness and tropical citrus with some dank in there too. Aftertaste evolves after each sip. Feel is good, fairly rich. Overall, delicious and smooth."
Abrasive Ale,4.53,"This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace.

Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.

Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor.

Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.

This is a such a great beer. Quenching and easy drinking. You could fool yourself into seasoning it until you fall on your face. So tasty and satisfying, I can go for another, and another, and another,"

t: Follows the nose with a moderate hop bite and dry finish.

m: Denser side of medium, very good body and some carbonation tingle.

o: A near the top of the top 250 brew years ago, now available in my state. Great flavor presaging the coming of the NE style. Not as fruity but with more tropical danky goodness than most of the best of the old West Coast style entries."
Abrasive Ale,4.25,"Bier #2 today, a fine, late winter day in New England.... From a 16oz can, bought somewhere recently for a bit o' coin...

It pours a rich, bright, medium golden color. Has a slight smidge of haze, but it's mostly clear. Carbo is steady, though the head is a thin layer of fine white foam, with light lacing. Has a nice aroma, with tangerine, pineapple and pithy grapefruit all present and accounted for. Body is medium to medium-plus, and it passes smoothly over the tongue.

Taste is more on the sweeter side vs. bitter.... Has peach, tangerine, pineapple, a hint of honey, a smidges of guava and passion-fruit. Has some subtle bitterness in the finish, though it is predominantly semisweet. Solid and tasty! Prosit!

Red Eye November,4.74,"2021 release. Bottle to tumbler.

Look: Jet black with with lots of tiny floaters looking like golden stardust. No head. No lacing.

Smell: Malty, sweet and boozy. Clear notes of rye, molasses and coffee.

Taste: The rye is very present with the molasses adding sweetness, the coffee bitterness. Dark chocolate is there, malty and woody hints as well. The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely.

Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation.

Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts. However, in this case every single one of them adds to a perfectly balanced taste which, together with the creamy mouthfeel, results in a fantastic beer."
Red Eye November,4.41,"2021 release - batch 5. 13.3% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter.

Clear (?) seal brown liquid with a faint tan collar. Vague sheen of tears; no head development.

Rich, balanced aromas of coffee, roast malt, chocolate covered cherries, faint pipe tobacco, and molasses; perhaps an earthy hop note at times.

Unctuous palate entry suffused with all the flavors from the nose, dialed up. Bittersweet chocolate, bright stone fruit/berry notes, leading to layers of cocoa, loam, treacle, and toasted brown sugar. Malt exhibits moderate roast qualities, but more forward character comes from the coffee and barrel. No char. Low bitterness. Medium-dry finish. Decent complexity, but more focus on balance and smoothness I think.

Oily, rich, medium-full body with dangerously disguised alcohol.

Excellent example of the style, although, perhaps, the base beer is a touch subdued. Maybe not the best value, but I won't dock any points for that..."
Red Eye November,4.61,"Midnight black oily pour with a brown head. The nose is essentially a perfect ba coffee stout nose, and thus elevated the overall score a bit: huge and full coffee with tones of bean and grounds plus earth, bittersweet dark chocolate, rye, dried date, plus huge rich barrel notes with an emphasis on the molasses and vanillin laiden bourbon, wow. Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent. Feel is chewy yet medium bodied, good barrel with the warmth in particular, but coffee is the clear star with roast and percolation for days. Overall just a little shy of being one of the greats, but the smell is there"
Red Eye November,4.75,"Pours a deep black color with a light brown colored head that leaves a little lacing down the glass. Smells of the deep roasted malt base, sweet molasses, and a nice blast of earthy coffee at the end. Tastes of sweet molasses, coffee, toffee, a hint of spicy rye at the end. Thick, smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, excellent feeling and excellent beer!"
Stille Nacht,4.35,"2020 vintage

This is one of my last holdouts from my trip to OEC last month. I’ve been consistently impressed by the international beers they carry, really just one of the best places for imports. Ok, OEC praise aside, I’m pretty excited to try this one as it’s considered a classic but I haven’t had it yet

Pours an opaque dark gold with a finger of creamy white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Sometimes the spices overwhelm the style, but they’re well integrated here. I’m picking up on aromas of clove, bready malt, toffee, black pepper, overripe banana, apple skin, and orange zest

Oh man, the flavor here is really unique, dancing between sweet, sour, and spicy elegantly. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting white pepper, golden raisin, lemon zest, toffee, crackery malt, clove, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of white grape, crackery malt, white pepper, sweet caramel, golden raisin, grassy hops, pear, and overripe banana

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp yet sweet beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent sweetness

I was really not expecting to like this beer as much as I did. It’s wholly unique and super delicious I need to get more"
Stille Nacht,4.33,Sweet syrupy. Sour on the backend. Spices are really apparent when smelling but the taste is more subtle. Just enough complexity for it to be interesting. Very strong.
Stille Nacht,4.03,"Poured into a Westvleteren XII chalice. Quite carbonated, but things settle down rapidly, leaving some lacing. The nose is sour and fresh. Velvety mouthfeel (a bit of a surprise) and full of fruit and spices. One particular spice reminds of a specific vegetable, but I can't put my finger on what. Also some flowery, perfumy notes. This has everything but the kitchen sink thrown at it. Also very boozy, obviously. Nice, but not quite up my wheelhouse."
Stille Nacht,4.38,"Deep gold body, unfiltered with visible particulate, the head forming thick and white, with good retention of a couple minutes.
Aromas of lemon, orange and grapefruit rind, black, pepper, charred oak, touch musty.
Warm acidity coupled with alcohol heat gets the juices fired up, like it's firing up the your metabolism and heating your veins; mellow but prominent yeast fruitiness, of sweet apple, white grape, accompanied by soft spice yeast phenols; the feel is buttery, balanced by fine, frothy carbonation; mild bitterness in the finish, like a stone fruit pit, keeps things dry; so much of this is undefinable, but flavourful and engaging.

This is a winter delight, with a distinct heat, and complex yeast flavours, all of it in a lovely harmonious dance. Drink this solo on a cold day."
Stille Nacht,3,"Don't understand the high scores for this one. As Belgians go, it's pretty ordinary stuff without anything to distinguish it in anyway. High alcohol, but well disguised in a hetfy dose of sugar. No fruitiness or hoppiness or depth of flavour. One dimensional. Doesn't offend to drink, but does not excite either. Anonymous."

Strong and complex fruity and spicy notes, hints of oak, decent hops in the finish. Very enjoyable."
Stille Nacht,4.24,"Second time's a charm. No gush on opening, pour yields a flat, clear medium golden body. Sweet aroma, apples, yeast. Taste brings some tang, fruity, sweet. Smooth. Subdued. And this is what I expected...

Alas i think this bottle has gone bad. Was so looking forward to it. Golden pour with foamy white head. Tart aroma, apples. Even more tartness in the taste, very sour. Based on thecreviews, this bottle has turned. Drain pour...."
Stille Nacht,4.42,"Pours a beautiful golden with white head. Good retention. Golden raisin on the nose. Apple, pear, caramel apple, deep sweetness from light brown sugar and honey character. Younger vintages will have more bitter hop character. Perhaps more fusel warming on the finish too. Older vintages will have a warming sensation without any harshness. A truly beautiful beer worthy of service for Christmas."
Stille Nacht,4.39,"330 ml bottle served cold into a tulip. LCBO purchase for $5.95 CDN. 2020 Bottling.

Appearance - Lightly hazy dark gold color with half a finger of dense white head on top. Good staying power and not much lacing. Cuts an imposing figure.

Smell - Quite sweet, candi sugar, apples and peaches, with some bready and yeasty qualities backing things up. Smells light and excellent aromatics.

Taste - Quite sweet again. Candi sugar, apples, peaches and other stone fruit. Light bready backbone, powdery yeast. Booze is incredibly well blended and hidden. It's balanced, but I'm struggling to find what the sweetness is balanced against.

Mouthfeel - Medium-full bodied, lively crisp carbonation, semi-dry finish, booze well hidden again, just some subtle heat going down the back of the throat. A sipper for sure.

Overall - Truly exceptional beer, deliciously fruity and tasty, very sweet, without going overboard and wonderfully crafted. I still can't believe this is 12% as it drinks more like a 8% BPA. Right up there with Duvel and LaChoffe as the highest of high class Strong Belgian Pale Ales. I probably give Duvel the slightest edge, but Stille Nacht maybe has a more whimsical ""How did the brewers do this?"" that is only matched by Cantillon, 3F (not that I've been able to try them), Orval, Westy and Rochefort. That in itself is an incredible feat."
Stille Nacht,4.43,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; ""bottled 2020"" as per the stamp on the crown. Served barely chilled.

Pours a muddy golden-orange colour, its complexion marred with countless tiny flecks of sediment. Situated atop is one finger of fluffy, foamy white head that collapses within a minute or two, leaving behind a frothy, generous collar and thin cap of film. Not much lacing at first, but you do get some as the level drops; looks fine to me. Yeasty on the nose - I'm getting notes of lemon zest, orange peel, clove, banana, bready malts and overripe orchard fruit including peach, apple, pear and grape. Smells a little sweet, with a modest ethanol presence (at least, for 12%) and a touch of acidity.

Now this right here? This is a fine night capper. Lightly caramelized malts, breadiness and candi sugar give way to a compelling array of fruity flavours that include apricot, apple, date and sugar-coated sultana raisin. Hints of banana, orange peel and white grape come through towards the back end, which is also rather spicy and yeasty - clove, white pepper, cinnamon, licorice and herbal hops, alongside some persistent candi sugar sweetness and a touch of ethanol warmth, both of which fade into the aftertaste. Full bodied, with slightly assertive carbonation that lends some much-needed liveliness to this brew's soft, slick, tongue-coating mouthfeel; very fulfilling texture. I can't believe how well-integrated that 12% is - I mean, you do notice some alcohol of course, but I've had beers in the 9-10% range that were much hotter/boozier than this.

Final Grade: 4.43, an outstanding A grade. Stille Nacht is one of the best Belgian beers I've had in quite some time - though it's definitely leaning towards the saccharine side of this style, so make sure your sweet tooth is prepared for the onslaught. This one'll cost a pretty penny (i.e. this small bottle was nearly $6 in Canuck funny money), but nonetheless a highly-recommended brew, not to mention a fantastic pick for my 2375th review. I will absolutely be picking up another bottle or two, as De Dolle claims it has excellent long term storage potential - and besides, who knows if I'll ever see this around here again?"
Stille Nacht,4.07,2019 11.2 oz bottle poured into tall tulip glass. First thing I noticed was how much “movement” there was in the glass. Not just bubbles but tons of little floaters moving with the bubbles like a million little dancers in my glass. Very sticky on the tongue and a little heavy on the alcohol on the back of the mouth. I did enjoy and would buy again but would be curious to age this one a few years.

Taste: Light to moderate sweetness, boozy, candi sugar, fig, apple, orange peel, pear, peppery spice, with notes of clove and banana.

Mouthfeel: Boozy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: It’s a sipper, but the combination of sweet and boozy, although not too extreme here, is still not my favourite."
Stille Nacht,4.16,"Bottle from Etre, bottled Oct 2019
Pours a lightly hazy light gold color with a good sized frothy bone white head that shows great retention. Aroma is filled with honey like maltiness light candy sugar and earthy spice. The flavor is intense caramelized honey like sweetness, confectionery sugar, with a bit of clove and peppery spice. Light to moderate warming alcohol. The last quarter of the bottle had to sit until the head from the initial pour settled down. When I poured it in it was considerably darker, sweeter and a bit more cloudy than the original pour. Reminded me of that darker chunk at the bottom of the Italian Ice package. Great brew and a wildly complex sipper, my first time and I guess I need to seek this out more often."
Stille Nacht,4.16,"Reviewed on Christmas Day. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into an Orval Chalice. It pours a cloudy, dirty golden color with a thin, foamy, milk-white head and lacing. Quite the smell! Sour apple, banana, caramel, and familiar Belgian spicing. The sweetness of the taste belies the rather sour nose. Much more candied apple, raisin, and banana, and sugar, along with caramel/toffee, clove, coriander and bitterness from the Nugget hops. It has a holiday dessert quality. It's surprisingly thick and syrupy with lively carbonation, and the 12% ABV is noticeable and warming. Overall, this is a big, flavorful, strong ale. Ideal for sipping at Christmas."
Stille Nacht,3.39,"Bottle. Pretty excited for this but it fell on a deaf palate for me. Exorbitantly sweet. It overpowers all other aspects of the beer. Too hot as well. Big, rich, sweet, boozy. Would be a great beer at maybe like 8%. Could definitely stand to sit down and age for quite a while."

Looking very nice in the glass. Orange/amber body, good carbonation streams early on. Loose bubbly white head lasts about halfway through, a few specks of lacing.

Aroma is, to be honest, non too pleasant. Funk falls into body odor.

However, this does not affect the taste, which is quite delightful. Sour and tart, on the dry side, a nice non citrus fruit presence. A spice hit, and a little funk. A dry bitterness towards the end.

Mouth pretty close to full, finish a dry bittersweet fruit.

$9.75 @ The Beer Yard, Wayne, PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: This beer is aged for a minimum of three years before bottling so that means it's at least 12 years old, and in the bottle for 9. Normally I wouldn't bother with a beer that old but geuze is a different beast. I'll imagine that it's probably a bit softer than it would be fresh though. The cork came out with a soft pop, and a careful pour delivered a slightly hazy orange colored body beneath a very short head of white that immediately fell leaving behind just a thin collar. The limited head retention is of course expected. It smells of fallen apples, pear, and distant orange. There's the usual funkiness as well with wet straw, old dried wood, soft leather, some mineral, a touch of mustiness, and just the lightest suggestion of horse blanket. The flavor is tart but not puckering. It's not as fruity as the aroma suggests, and it's oaky, mineralish, musty, grassy, leathery, earthy, and ever so slightly metallic. There's some malt to it but it's not really sweet; you can tell that it's balancing the acidity though. It's quite balanced for a geuze. The finish is of course dry and acidic, and it lingers shortly on the tongue. It's light-medium in body with a very delicate carbonation that lends a delicate caress to the tounge. I'm guessing that it's lost some carbonation over the years but I'm still happy with it. I'll be sure to seek out a fresher bottle next time. All in all I'm quite impressed. It's very nicely rounded with a lot of different components, and none of them stand out above the others.

Pours an orangeish hue that's more golden in the light with off white head. Lots of bell pepper on the nose. Mild funk in the washed rind cheese realm. It's got your typical lambic flavor profile, lots of pepper and cheese character with a touch of sweet fresh orange juice on the finish. Acidity is restrained. The minerality is balanced. This is lovely."
Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait,4.35,"had the 2015 vintage today at the porterhouse nassau street, another wonderful gueuze, an enchanting drink, a tonne of complex funky flavours balanced against lovely sweet fruit flavours, apple, pear, orange, peach, some vanilla, earthy, wood, black pepper, leather, quite sour, light to medium bodied, high carbonation, some alcohol warming, super smooth and drinkable, just so nice to drink, i love a good gueuze, this is good gueuze."

Feels medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real nice oude geuze lambic."
Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait,4.35,"375ml corked and cages bottle - 2013 vintage - poured into a long stemmed tulip at 50°F. Good pop. Slow pour - no sediment, no gush.

Pours a beautiful crystal clear fiery orange - glowing with almost amber hues, topped with a finger of loose, off-white head, that very quickly recedes to a foamy collar. Slow, lazy, but plentiful effervescence continuously rises to the surface. Very pretty.

Nose: Ahh, oak. So much oak. Wet oak. Wet funky oak. Very traditionally oaky. In addition to the absurd amount of oak, there's tons of funk - barnyard, horseblanket, wet leaves, hay, grass, earth, etc.. There is a whole bouquet of bright, fresh notes as well, namely Apple, but also pear, spring flowers, fresh rain, berry stems and seeds, white grape, and of course lemon, which also lends a definef tartness, which is really not all that acetic or vinegary. There's also tons of leather, dusty attic, old library, and stone. Beautiful.

Palate: Right from the start, there is a grainy malt sweetness that is actually fairly surprising. I'm sure the higher ABV (8%) is responsible for that. There's tartness that quickly follows, but it really isn't a sour beer. Perhaps 7 years in the cellar has mellowed this out. So we open with some slightly sweet, musty, dusty grain and malt, alongside a very restrained tartness - mostly brett, but lactic as well. The brett influence is HUGE, and every possibly bretty note is in here. A bit sweaty, tons of overripe stone fruit - namely peach and apricot that's borderline moldy. Huge vinous quality, with both red and white wine notes. Tons of bright apple, pear, and plum too. The oak is front and center, going hand-in-hand with the funk, lending a bit wet woody note. Plenty if lactic minerality as well, which could be seen as a touch of salinity. The sweetness lends a bit of a funky honey note as well, right before the finish which brings some vanilla notes from the wood. In the finish, the sweetness subsidies, and that oak really ramps up and lends a nice splinter dryness. This accentuates the vinous character, and it finishes not too dissimilar to an old wine. Given the surprisingly amount of dark fruit and berry notes in here, it almost leans towards a red wine.

Mouthfeel/Body: Obviously, an ale of this nature is going to lean on the lighter-bodied side. Given the higher ABV, and the touch of sweetness that it lends, it really bumps that closer to medium-light in body. The effervescence, while not champagne-level lively, is definitely champagne-level fine, and shares the mouthfeel of an ever-so-slightly lazier champagne. Drying from the oak.

Overall: This is a nice gueuze. Now, are there better examples of the style? Certainly! I've yet to open any of my Cantillon bottles, but I'm sure this isn't in the same league as them, or Drie Fonteinen. I think the one thing really holding this back is the sweetness. If this were a bit drier, I think that would help open it up a little. Now, it's still fantastic, and it delivers more than any typical wild ale you'll encpunter. It's funky, it's colourful, it's balanced, and it's insanely oaky and rather mature. I think this is a brilliant gateway gueuze, and for the price and accessibility, how can you turn it down? Under $10 for a mature, cellared, authentic Oude Gueuze? Come on, that's where it's at! If your'e AN INSECT JUST LANDED IN MY GUEUZE... okay, little bugger out. It'll just add to the funk, right? Right. If you like sour ales, just try it. It isn't so funky that it'll put you off, but it's just funky enough to appreciate."

Very clean orange appearance, at first. One finger of white foam, quite evanescent.
In the smell leather, some metallic notes, fruiiness, ripe peach, goose berry. Astringency.
In the taste a very clean sourness, some dusty cellar. Well managed sourness.
Light salty note, again leather, horse blanket.
Light astringency, lemon.
Very drinkable."
Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait,4.13,"2014 vintage, batch 80306, Best before 12/04/2037. 12.7oz bottle (purchased at Garden Path Fermentation) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a lovely dark orange color with over an inch of white head that had very good retention and no lacing.

Strong funk in the nose, with some base grains showing through. And very soft floral hop notes.

Pretty similar on the tongue, with a very slight orange taste at the back.

The body was light, crisp, and smooth, with tartly dry finish.

Drinkability was very good, especially if you like the funk.

Overall, excellent brew. Might try to find older vintages, or age a couple on my own."
Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait,3.96,"375ml bottle poured into tulip. This one is from 2015.

Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of off-white head that leaves a bit of splotchy lace as it quickly recedes.

Smells of sour white grapes, underripe apple, lemon juice, leather jacket, barnyard funk, barrel wood and white wine vinegar.

Tastes of more sharp vinegar, juicy green apples, unsugared lemon slices, more earthy barnyard funkiness, oak staves and some soft vanilla.

Feels light and soft. Medium bodied with frothy carbonation. FInishes dry

Verdict: Recommended. Goes a little hard on the sourness, but still pretty damn tasty."
Imperial Stout,4.33,"2015 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours basically black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

T: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, black coffee, a little char, earthy, molasses a touch of toffee, and faint dark fruit on the finish.

M: Full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth.

O: Somehow I think this one went straight from the store to my cellar and has been there ever since, so it's about time I crack into it!
Total time capsule back to before every imperial stout was loaded up with adjuncts and it's aged beautifully. Another example of why Founders is quite possibly the best at brewing dark beers."
Imperial Stout,4.69,"12 oz bottle, born on 11/5/19, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:
L - dark mahogany with a hazelnut head that lingered around the edges
S - roasted malt, molasses, bitter chocolate, coffee
T - follows the nose very well
F - thick mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O - this beer lives up to the founders standard; it is supposed to age well and just under 2.5 years in it is still sensational"
Imperial Stout,4.43,"Single 12 ounce bottle from Founders in Grand Rapids Nov 2019 when travel was still a thing.
Pours pitch black with finger of creamy mildly reddish brown head.
Aroma of dark fruits, caramel, mildly roasty with notes of chocolate and just a hint of coffee.
Taste is rich with plummy note, chocolate; a brief wave of smoke drifts across the palate, caramel malt and a touch of espresso bitterness balancing the sweetness.
Rich and smooth full creamy mouthfeel with a hint of boozy heat - wonderfully bittersweet. Wish more had followed me home."
Imperial Stout,4.23,"Look: Poured from 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Midnight black with a creamy burnt amber head. Wonderful looking beer.

Smell: Roasted coffee beans, malts, caramel, dark chocolate.

Taste: Chocolate, cacao, malts, coffee. Also getting some dried fruits - possibly cranberry or cherry.

Feel: Creamy thick mouthfeel, this thing just rips as it goes down. Has a dark feel to it (literally and figuratively), great for sipping with a book. Gets better as it warms.

Overall: One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts you can find pretty widely available, highly recommend. If dark evil beers are your thing, pick this up."
Imperial Stout,4.16,"12oz bottle. This thing has been aged in the mini-fridge for 5+ years (!) and now is the time to crack this sucker (review from notes)

5 years and it still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet. Tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating

This is impressive, to be this awesome after 5 years. In my mind this was developed specifically to age, and I wouldn't be surprised if that wasn't literally true"
Imperial Stout,4.4,"355 ml bottle, from the Norwegian importer. ABV is 10.5%, 90 IBU. Pitch black colour, impressive brown head. Roasty aroma, roast malts, strong coffee, dark chocolate, liquorice, tar, wood and a hint of smoke. Rich mouthfeel. Medium sweet and rich flavour, roast malts, liquorice and strong coffee galore, bitter hops in the finish. High ""Wow!"" factor."
Imperial Stout,4.68,"11-2019 vintage

Let it warm to at least 55F to really enjoy and it cellared nicely - 1yr 4mos (going to revisit at 2 yrs). Very viscous, creamy mouthfeel was what I noticed first, then a rush of roasted dark malts, dark chocolate and coffee took over. A mild bitterness is mixed in and keeps it from being too sweet. Wonderful finish and aftertaste that holds on. This one handles cellaring very nicely."
Imperial Stout,4.48,"Bottle received from @whyteboar in Bif12.5

Poured into a snifter , pitch black 10w40 motor oil that has been ridden hard and put away wet. Capped by a dense creamy one finger brown foamy layer, good retention, good lacings, settles to a ring with islands

Aroma of roast malts, roasted coffee, dark chocolate

Roasted malts, char

Good sudsing, Very smooth, slight acrid char finish on the back of the tongue

Good stout, thanks @whyteboar"
Imperial Stout,4.19,"Look: black

Smell: boozy plums, grapes

Taste: dark and sweet

Feel: syrup. Where it shines.

Overall: I remember this being way too hot but I now actually prefer it to the breakfast stout"
Imperial Stout,4.18,"Classic and iconic Russian Imperial Stout. Pours black with a thin mocha head. The aroma is malt and booze. The taste is dominated by a powerful roasted maltiness with undertones of dark fruit and hops, and a hint of chocolate. Quite aggressive and dry. Savory and not sweet. A bit too much booziness and alcohol warming. Full mouthfeel.

One drawback is the price. If it were less expensive and more widely available I would have it all the time."
Imperial Stout,4.53,"One of the benchmark RIS that I can reliably calibrate my palate with or just enjoy on its own merit.
Consistently good and balanced with the malts dominating and the hops support the depth of flavor. Really good stuff!"
Imperial Stout,4.14,"Bottled 11/6/19 and poured into a tulip. Very dark with a faint redish hue around the edges as it poured. One finger of tan colored head that left behind some nice lacing. Aroma didn't waft out of the glass, but once I get close to get a whiff, it's a really nice maltly smell with distinct chocolate notes. Taste is roasty malts, chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied, and actually a hair thinner than I was expecting based on the ABV. Good beer."
Imperial Stout,4.3,"Bottle from cask n flask San Jose.
~1yr old.
L: black with mocha head.
S: molasses, licorice, caramel, roasty.
T: roasted malt dominates, notes of chocolate, coffee, licorice, caramel. Burnt bitter finish.
F: perfect to style.
Overall: unsurprisingly a great stout from Founders."
Imperial Stout,4.47,"Pours jet black with a one-inch ruddy brown head, nice lacing left throughout. At first, nose is brownie batter, freshly ground coffee, cinnamon. Taste begins up front rather bitter - dark chocolate, cocoa, chocolate covered coffee beans, with a strongly bitter, warming finish. As it warms, the alcohol gets more pronounced on the finish (obviously), but never becomes overwhelming. The bitterness recedes just a touch as well, with a bit more malty/chocolatey sweetness emerging. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, but there is noticeable carbonation. Really pleased to get a bottle (for whatever reason, I never see this around me)."
Imperial Stout,4.63,"I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf from a beer store in LaCrosse, WI. It poured an opaque dark with tan head that is leaving some lace. The scent had a mix of vanilla, molasses, cocoa and roast. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip with molasses, cocoa and hints of cinnamon flare. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it is an excellent beer."
Imperial Stout,4.61,"Pours black with a 2 inch thick, foamy head. Heavy lacing to the end.

Aroma of chocolate, molasses, coffee.

Taste is coffee, molasses, cocoa, oak. A bit astringent.

Full bodied, thick and syrupy. Light carbonation. Dry finish.

Another winner from Founders."
Imperial Stout,4.37,"Just a fantastic RIS I love to return to. Dark and malty, chocolate, coffee... it’s all there on the nose and on the tongue. The 75 IBU rating must be a mistake. So smooth but not too sweet.
World class indeed."
Pliny The Younger,5,"Extremely dry and extremely worth it. Outstanding in its own way, just like how Heady Topper is unique in it's own way."
Pliny The Younger,4.61,"Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency. Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam.

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity.

Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts.

Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation.

Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 500mL bottle."
Pliny The Younger,3,"On draft on March 25th and bottle today. In the past four trips up over a decade, Pliny would always have an unmistakable distinguished character to it. It was the Cadillac of Russian River. This time I called the server over. ""Are you sure this is it? Not Happy Hops or something else?"". Nope. This was Younger. More acidic and lacking the smooth richness and piney, sticky aftertaste, and gone was the once amazing nose of sap and sweet burnt sugar. With three to try on this visit, I had just one pour, and was, like my friend, stumped and disappointed. The vibe of visiting Windsor was pleasant, I took a self guided tour, the wait in the spring sunshine a mere three and a half hours, and the food there scrumptious. My friend and I shared a bottle of Refraction, a collab with Brooklyn Brewery, and that seemed to have more to offer. Still, I purchased two bottles of PtY to go to give it another shot at home. Pouring it now in a four ounce glass akin to what they served it in at Santa Rosa, I have the same vibes from it. I got a four pack of R&D #4 from the gift shop and enjoyed those more. Alas!"
Pliny The Younger,5,"Appearance - The beer poured a clear golden color with visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The earthy pine notes were strong in the nose. By way of comparison, it smelled like in the amped up version of Elder.

Taste - Having sampled Pliny the elder first, I will use it as a means of comparison. Younger seemed like an amped up version of Elder. The green grass and hops was next level. The pine notes left a little room for sweetness, but there was somewhat of a backbone. The pain notes lingered in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had the body of an imperial, with carbonation scrubbing away the sweetness and allowing the bitterness to linger.

Overall - Hype-worthy. Glad I got to try some, thanks @bret27"
Pliny The Younger,4.55,"There's a reason it's rated as high as it is. PTY has loads of citrus aroma and flavor, but at 10.25% it's as smooth as they some."
Pliny The Younger,4.71,"Look - golden mostly clear with a nice white head and rimming
Smell - citrus tangerine slight pine
Taste - bitter citrus slight creamy a little caramel
Feel - full body with lighter carb
Overall - fantastic straight west coast"
Pliny The Younger,4.87,"Welp, it’s been about 18 years or so on the hunt for this elusive brew. Ever since finding craft beer through Sam Adams in the early college days of the mid-2000s, this has been the ultimate Sasquatch beer. Spent most of my years on the east coast and college in Arizona but never took the trip to Northern California. Then finally, living in San Diego, they decide to send more kegs for 2022. Incredible find through a random Google search. Turns out the owner of Fathom Bistro & Bar knows Vinnie. I figured it would be similar to the best beers from HF/TH/Trillium but it’s so different. It’s the perfect West Coast hoppy beer but amplified. Super resinous, dry, and dank. Amazing finish. Feel and body are so smooth. Flavor is obviously off the charts. This is worth the hype!!!"
Pliny The Younger,5,Blind Donkey
Pliny The Younger,4.54,"The other reviewers pretty much hit everything I have to say about this beer, except that you will get very, very drunk if you have more than three or four ;). *This is a biased review. I'm from the area and went to SRJC. No matter, this is one of the best beers you can buy in the world."
Festina Pêche,3.83,"It is pretty cool to see tiny peach chunks floating around. The smell is not as good as it could be. It's a subtle peach smell slightly overpowered by the sour. The taste of this beer is excellent though. If you love peach with a sour afternoon, this is the beer for you. This beer is so refreshing on a hot day and so crushable. The low abv and flavor make this an excellent light choice for the summer."
Festina Pêche,3.54,"This beer pours a cloudy apricot color with a moderate white head. There is a strong, pleasant smell of pineapple. The taste is bitter and tangy. The most notable flavor is lemon, but its overpowered by an artificial sweetener."
Festina Pêche,3.81,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Clear light golden pour with 2 fingers of fizzy white head. Falls fast... minimal lacing.

S: Tart and fruity. Peach and light citrus.

T.F: Peach/apricot up front. Fruit... lemon citrus and crackery grains. Modest tartness... not really sour. Light bodied and well carbonated. Lingering peach preserves at the finish.

O: A nice tart peach forward Weisse. Easy drinking... and with the low ABV super drinkable."
Festina Pêche,3.65,"12 ounce can poured into a willi becher.

Nice peach aroma. Peach flavor is good to but more subtle. Light and refreshing, not too tart, a touch watery."

A nice tart beer. Thirst quenching."
Festina Pêche,3.66,"12oz can from the variety pack, about 2 months old

Unfiltered, no foam at first, but a big head that sticks around after an aggressive pour; looks like apple cider otherwise. Not too sweet, not too sour... tart. Light. Not much to speak of, grain and sour peaches. Smells like a corona with too much lime.

The ""Neo-Berliner Weiss"" tag is bizarre - I'll call it ""Sour Light"""
Festina Pêche,3.93,"Bottled 5/19/18

Pours a pale golden straw with a finger of quickly fading white head

The aroma has a strong note of lemon sourness with light malts to back it up, not much peach at all

The front of the sip is tart and a little malty, and it turns into a more subtle, dry peach with a doughy aftertaste. A great balance here, though I was expecting a bit more on the peach front

Highly carbonated and easy drinking, a very light refreshing finish

This is an all around great beer, despite the only slight hint of peach flavor, which could be chalked up to freshness, it's just over 17 months old so it may have lost a bit of flavor, and I'd love to try it fresh"
Festina Pêche,3.68,Glad I tried it. Pretty decent and I liked it well enough that I bought more.
Festina Pêche,3.85,"I had a full draft pint at the brewpub in Rehobeth on my birthday in 2017. It was sour, which I usually don't like, but it was tasty nonetheless on a warm day. I have liked other peach beers in the past. Enjoyed the brewpub, but it was very crowded in early August and we had to wait for a table."
Festina Pêche,4.18,"Clear pale yellow hue.

White head; no lace.

Sweet peach nose.

Thin mouthfeel.

Sweet effervescent peach delight. Great summer delight-almost like champagne."
Festina Pêche,4.57,One of my favorite tart ales the peach gives just enough sweet to balance. Aftertaste has a hint of fresh peach nothing artificial or cloying.
Festina Pêche,4.28,"Poured aggresively into a Mason Jar :D Beautiful thick white head dissapates resonably quick to reveal a thin lacing of white atop a pale straw ambrosia :) now the fun begins.... Aromas of sour dough, ripe peaches and Musk give way to a paletable sour! This is one of the easier drinking sours ( i would reconmend it to anyone unsure about the style). Very refreshing sour and a light finish that leaves you wanting more :) A darn fine brew indeed!"
Festina Pêche,3.5,Just not a fan of this type of beer
Festina Pêche,4.87,This Neo-Berliner Weisse that is fermented with peaches is by far one of my all time favorites. A pale gold appearance with a nice white head. The Aroma makes me think of a peach orchid with a hint of lemon. The balance between fruit and crisp style with a bit of a sourness is refreshing . The mouthfeel is clean with a great finish. Summertime however can see this beer go down faster than normal.
Festina Pêche,4.06,"This is the rare beer that I actually prefer to drink directly from the bottle. For whatever reason, the peche / peach pops more that way. Drank it that way at a tailgate that was lacking glassware once, and now it 's my preferred modus drinkerus for this beer."
Red Poppy Ale,4.18,"Red Poppy pours a vibrant ruddy brown color with a massive tan head that dissipates quickly and unevenly, producing a short-lived rocky effect that’s quite pretty while it lasts before leaving a film-like cap, a thick crown and some spotty strands of lacing.

It has a nice aroma of vinegar and cherry with both leather and some slightly creamy notes behind.

That great vinegary Flanders quality continues to the taste, with the edges nicely rounded by the fruit and perhaps by age. There’s a definite red wine element to it also, which provides some depth I enjoy. The taste closes with a fairly tart, drying finish that lets just a little of the cherry juice linger.

The feel’s medium bodied and soft with soft carbonation.

This is a really well-made beer. The cherry doesn’t pop as much as, say, Alexander, but it’s a pleasant undercurrent throughout and counteracts the acidity. Can’t really say what the poppy seeds added, but they certainly don’t detract from the beer in any way.

I couldn’t find a clear bottling date anywhere on here, but there’s a raised, unobtrusive “19” on the glass, making me think that’s when the bottle and/or beer was made."
Red Poppy Ale,2.73,"Purchased in November 2021 from HopHeads in Altona, on the outer western edge of Melbourne, in Australia. Drunk in July 2022.

Pours a bright burgundy colour. There's no evident carbonation and no head.

The nose is strongly sour cherry and balsamic vinegar. There are hints of vanilla. The aroma already has my mouth watering, but it's already presenting as something that's going to be overwhelmingly sour and acidic. I'm not sure I'm looking forward to it...

The taste, oh my, the taste. It's bracing. It's like the first time I had a Warhead lolly, with an immediate reaction of ""wow, that's sour"". In fact, it's extremely sour, like a mouthful of sour (Morello) cherries. There's also a sharp, dry kick at the end. As it warms it mellows slightly but develops tannic notes and grape or cherry skin highlights, to the point it begins to resemble a red wine, but with a residual vinegar aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is sharp, and it's almost stinging on the way down. Not terribly enjoyable for mine.

Overall this is too sour and then too much like I'm drinking a glass of red wine. I've read a number of reviews and none seem to mirror the harshness of my experience with the beer, which was not an enjoyable one. Maybe I had a bad bottle or it had been treated poorly before reaching me? Not sure, but I can only go on my evidence.

Cheers!"

Taste is tart, cherry, tannic. Some fruit skin bitterness.

Mouthfeel is light. Overall, pretty good."
Red Poppy Ale,4.43,"Pours a ruddy amber auburn. Light aroma, with a faint cherry tinge. Lightly tart, sharply effervescent, completely delicious.
Tried this with at least a year and change on it, possibly a lot longer. Held up well."
Red Poppy Ale,4.6,"Not able to try Lost Abbey often, but this was gifted me in a recent Can-Cans BIF so I got to try it.
Mixed reaction, glad to be drinking it, bummed I can't go to the store and buy any around here.
But that's not a review-
Poured from 12 oz ""stovepipe"" can into a stemless teku glass. Color brown, like a strongly brewed iced tea, but the tan head that quickly builds and faded to mere lacing assures me this isn't tea.
The aroma is definitely cherry forward, but backed by malts of unknown origin. Unexpected but very pleasant.
Taste leaves everything I experienced with this beer in the rear view. Tart cherries strongly edge a malty base and combine in a way I've never experienced in a sour before. Really something. And really good!
Feel is tingly, but not from carbonation. crisp and smooth, how that's simultaneously done I may never know.
Good beer. Bummed its only 12 oz now."
Red Poppy Ale,4.19,"375ml bottle into a tulip. No freshness dating could be found.

Looks very good in the glass. Dull mauve body with a generous pink tinged head. This shrinks to a collar and covering leaving scattered lacing.

Aroma of sour cherries.

This first mouthful is a bit vinegary. Then the palate adjusts and the beer has a delightful sour, tart, cherry flavor with some sweetness pushing through, and even a little vanilla. Even the vinegar blends well. Very smooth as well.

Mouth medium, finish sour tart cherry.

Overall, really enjoyed this one. A lot going on, and very well balanced."
Red Poppy Ale,4.75,12.7 fluid ounce bottle copped from Bottle King in Livingston. Tremendous pour commanding respect with a full five-finger head. Intense aroma laden with strong nuances of brettanomyces and yeast. Assertive flavor present with powerful notes of sour apple and cider. Excellent rendition of a very pleasing style.
Red Poppy Ale,4.59,"Poured into an arome glass from bottle.
Look: Dark reddish/brown with evidence of a highly carbonated beverage from the second it was poured out of the bottle. Scant tan head.
Smell: This is a great smelling beer with tons of cherry aroma with a hint of oak.
Taste: Almost tastes like a cherry soda. This beer is reminiscent of several lambic beers that I have sampled in the past. Mild aftertaste not uncommon in barrel-aged beers that takes some getting used to.
Mouthfeel: Tons of carbonation. As effervescent as a glass of champagne.
Overall: Lost Abbey rarely disappoints, and this is yet another very interesting and impressive beer from them."

Red Poppy Ale,4.67,"12.7oz bottle

Pours ruby red with a dense creamy khaki colored foam head.

Tastes like fresh sour dark cherries, dark fruit, dusty leathery barnyard funk, horse blanket, sweet spice, hay, poppy seeds, toasty bready caramel malts, some toffee, molasses, hint of vanilla, mild chocolate, oak barrel, slightly acetic red wine, tart red fruits, berry, cranberry skin, with floral earthy grassy hops. Feels medium bodied, creamy with moderate smooth carbonation. Overall a really nice barrel-aged sour ale with cherries and poppy seeds."
Red Poppy Ale,4.35,"In review is a 2015 vintage.

A - Vibrant, clear amber cherry red color with frothy and creamy pink/tan head and lacing. Carbonation is nice and steady.

S - Tart, funky, tangy cherry dominates the nose with delicate oak.

T - Cherries from start to finish - tart, funk, cherry tang, a slight hit of twangy acidity, borderline puckering, and finishes with a lingering puckering tart cherry.

M - Thick and bone dry on the back of the tongue while the rest of the mouth salivates profusely.

O - The style is hit or miss with me but this is impressive, especially being (5) years old. The bottle is only 325 mls and no way I could finish this on my own (which is why I'm splitting it with my wife). Make sure you have some Pepcid on hand. ;o)"
Red Poppy Ale,4.25,On tap at the Archives
Red Poppy Ale,2.99,"No bottling date visible

Pours a yeast-clouded rusty mahogany brown with a vague amber tint and is topped with an almost creamy 2.5 fingers of fluffy, lightly tan foam; solid retention leaves a paper-thin cap, frothy collar, and dense rings of temporary lacing wall the glass.

Aromas open with soft raspberry and light oaky funk until ripe cherry skins peak in the middle; clean lactic acidity on the back end; oak and softer notes vanillin and a dusting of cinnamon develop as the beer warms.

Taste shows a heavily muddled raspberry and cherry tones upfront accompanied by a weak spritzy oak funk; a lactic touch lasts into a watery finish with only hints of earthy spice lingering through the swallow; mild poppy seed exhale.

Mouthfeel brings a moderate-light body with a filling, airy carbonation; evens a little flatly along the mid-palate to a dry acidity on the finish accompanied by a thin swallow.

Without an age statement, it's impossible to know the condition of this one, but regardless, what was presented in this bottle did not live up to this brew's lofty esteem; flavors were muddled, the mouthfeel was tentative, and an overall lack of steady character persisted. I'm not sure exactly what went wrong here, and would be willing to revisit it in the future (with a defined age statement), but this beer just presents as a shell of what it could have been."
Red Poppy Ale,4.46,"A- 375ml cork pops off with a bang and the bottle pours a deep amber to brown brew into a snifter with a very foamy tan cap. The cap dies quickly and lacing is rare.

S- Massive sour cherry and Flanders flora funkiness with that mix of lactic and acetic with dark vinous fruits that Flanders are known for. Strong vinous dark sour grapes as it warms as well as notes of black cherry, currants and plums. Fruity sour interplay drives the aroma. Hints of toasted grains and malts in the backdrop rounding it out.

T- The cherries pith, tartness and flesh lead things off and it quickly transitions into the strong Flanders sour bug base. Vinous wet, aged oak and dark grapes, big blackberry, plums, bittersweet orange, red currants and dry, spicy seed hints. Again mostly lactic sours but still a bit of vinegar that gives it the Flanders vinaigrette feel when combined with the big fruity flavors. Slight phenolics and dry spicy bitterness. Touch of oaky vanilla.

MF- Slick medium bodied sour with a moderately low level of carbonation. The texture is a bit oily and frothy. Ends with a medium-high acetic and lactic sourness.

Have had this a few times over the last decade and it never disappointing. Bold sourness but plenty of big flavors between the barrel, fruits, seeds and malts all balancing into a unique, consistent brew."
Red Poppy Ale,4.22,"No bottled date, quite strange for a bottle that cost $15

Pours a wonderful deep brown with a finger and a half of white/tan head into a snifter. The cork/cage bottle also looks fantastic

Up front, this smells more malty than sour, with brown malts and woodiness leading with notes of spices to follow. There's almost a medicinal cherry aroma which is rather off putting

The taste here is not what the aroma suggests, rather it is wonderfully sweet and tart cherry with a strong malt backbone that keeps everything in check. I can also pick up on other fruity flavors, such as blackberry and maybe even white grape. I feel like I am picking up the slightly spicy poppy seed flavor, but that might just be power of suggestion. Nevertheless, it tastes incredible, a very balanced sour

The darker malts here make the mouthfeel a bit heavier than I expected, but it still goes down fairly easily, leaving a slick feeling on the tongue

This is my first Flanders Red, and after this brew I want to explore the style even more! It all comes down to balance on this beer, and each sip leads me craving more. Well done Lost Abbey, and a huge shoutout to Craft Beer Kings for this bottle. I made sure to save this for last of the 5 beers I recently ordered, I just wished I had saved it for a special occasion, but I guess Mondays can be special lol"
Red Poppy Ale,4,"Unknown vintage; drank 7/31/14 @ Yuss Haus.

Murky orange/red rust color.

Cream head; thick lace.

Raspberry tartness in the nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Funk & raspberry tartness in the flavor; good but a few sips is enough for me!"
Miller Lite,3.55,"exceeds at being what it's made to be. it's a miller high life, but lighter. the finish leaves the same notes, yet looks the same in the glass. does make me yearn for a MGD."
Miller Lite,2.82,"Poured from a 12oz can best by Oct 10 2022

On the pour a nearly 2 finger lightly fizzy head formed and left some surprisingly decent lacing. Body is a darker golden straw carbonation is high but fine.

Aroma is malty, adjuncty, and has a bit of that cheap lager funk to it. I want to say I can detect hops similar to a pilsner but it's definitely leaning more toward cheap AAL. Not great, but for the style it's pretty good.

Taste is similar to MHL. A bit too sweet but relatively clean and light apart from the adjunct. Not a lot of bitterness but there is a very light hint. Not offensive not great but way better than coors light. This is light enough that I can taste carbonic acid like in a seltzer.

Feel is carbonated, relatively dry and easy drinking. A bit bigger than your average light beer, and with a longer finish. Completely average and it does its job.

Overall for a BMC light beer this is pretty good. Certainly not mind blowing but I'd get this again. Miller always seems to do better Than Bud and coors (even tho Miller is owned by coors in the US now but whatever)"
Miller Lite,2.67,"Got this from the neighbor after chatting on the fenceline in this heat. Anyway, let's see what I found.

Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is a crystal clear light gold color with a medium sized white head. The taste is of some hops and grain. Overall, not much but an okay beer if you drink it when it's really ice cold."
Miller Lite,2.1,The best cheap beer I can tolerate. Still not that great overall.
Miller Lite,3.89,"The best cheap lite beer hands down. At a gas station and need a beer? Miller Lite. At a party? Miller Lite. Need something cheap? Miller Lite. This beer is more dependable than an old honda. When they're cold its actually not bad at all, more flavor than a bud light without tasting like piss."
Miller Lite,3.21,"Probably the best lite/light beer I've tasted, carries a lot of the flavor profile and body of High Life (my fave AAL to date). These are free at a place I visited and I cannot complain. Would try again, but if I must use my money, I'm going with the real deal."
Miller Lite,3.56,"It sucks... I love it. My favorite shitty beer, it's lite and it avoids the pisswater trope that these kinds of beers fall into. Lot of good memories with this garbage"
Miller Lite,2.38,Coors Light but sophisticated. Wish it came out my tap instead of water.
Miller Lite,4.06,"This is the beer that finally made me cave in and make an account on this website after seeing the great injustice of the overall rating people on this site have been giving it. If you’re rating this low for taste or appearance or whatever, you’re COMPLETELY MISSING THE POINT, and your friends have a separate group chat that you’re not in.

As another reviewer said - serve ‘‘em cold, and keep ‘‘em coming. You aren’t going to find a better popular light beer. This stuff hits the spot every time, it’s the 1999 Toyota Corolla of beer."
Miller Lite,3.44,For 100 calories this is a solid choice relative to other options in terms of light beer! Although it’s only at 4.2% it still has enough body in the overall flavor. This beer is always a good fallback when looking for something that isn’t on the pricier side and it is a good choice as a volume beer
Miller Lite,4.4,"This is one of the best 100 calorie per 12 oz beers I've ever had.
Of course there are times when I want something stronger..but there are times for me when a beer like this is just right.
I'm not going to bore you with some flowery and pretentious review where I tell you that I taste notes of hazel nuts and amaranth.
If your taste buds haven't yet been destroyed with 100 IBU ales, hard liquor and who knows what else...you might be able to appreciate this light lager."
Miller Lite,1.72,"A: Cheerful gold color. Watery thin head. Plenty of carbonation.

S: Malt, bread, grain.

T: Lacking. Bland. Light taste of grain. Malt.

M: Watery, thin, no substance.

O: Standard, watery, thin beer. Great for teenagers."
Miller Lite,1.2,"Why people would spend extra money to drink a can of carbonated water is beyond me. Because that is exactly what it tastes like.
Smell: There is no smell
Taste: It tastes like carbonated water but worse. The most prominent flavor is the taste of corn syrup/metallic tinge. Idk all the ingredient that are put in here BC Miller does not list them, but something tastes funky. You can taste the artificial syrup taste you get from cheap beer. So overall, carbonated water actually has a more pleasant taste than this.
Mouthfeel: None to speak of, just like water.
Overall, this is the kind of beer people drink who don't like the taste of beer. BC it doesn't taste like beer. Kids likely drink this stuff to get smashed. However, the ABV is so low you would have to smash 5 of these in a row just to get a decent buzz."
Miller Lite,3,"I am not a fan of light beers. Too much water which of course, dilutes taste and hops."
Miller Lite,4.64,What a go to beer...I've read dozens of reviews of beer on this site and finally opened an account...let's face it...Miller Lite is a classic...no fancy and cute names here...no heavy ABV that makes you want a mixed drink and say to He// with it...nope this is American beer for Americans...great anytime...with great taste and no bull shi/....
Miller Lite,4.5,"For a light beer not bad at all. Taste like a classic light lager
Rating for the style not comparing it to a IPA
got a tall boy today taste good for beer!"
Miller Lite,5,"It's this beer fermented with organic yak nut sack yeast.....no, does it have more piney hopps than a bowl of Alaskan Thunder F%*-k.....no. I'll tell you what it is, it is more reliable than WD-40 and craftsman tools.......this is a 4 season crushable beer, perfect from BBQ to Bar mitzvahs. Pairs well with good food and good friends, don't try and make it something it's not. Best served ice cold and keep them coming."
Budweiser,2.94,"Budweiser is a solid American lager. For what it is - a crisp, light, simple beer, it’s excellent. The consistency of their production is obviously incredible, and in the right setting (a hot summer day, or in the evening in a buzzing pub while watching the game) there are few things that can stand up to this classic. It’s best enjoyed cold and fresh, with its natural carbonation and mild beechwood finish and glorious light gold color and mild head. Folks complaining that it’s not like their good ol’ German beer or hazy mega-juice buttsmacker IPA aren’t wrong that it’s not a beer with a heavy body or distinct taste palate. But that’s missing the point of this beer completely. I’ve always got a fresh pack in the garage fridge."
Budweiser,1.6,"I found a bottle of Budweiser in somebody's refrigerator.
Look: Budweiser had significant foam from what I could see.
Smell: Budwieser had the hazy pungent aroma of corn mixed with industrial chemicals.
Taste: Budweiser had a sweet corn flavour with heavy hints of industrial chemicals. There was a mysterious bitterness within the aftertaste of the Budweiser I drank.
Feel: After I drank the Budweiser, I felt like I was drinking industrial chemicals mixed into a corn flavoured soda. I got scared that I would have a tummy ache.
Overall: I cannot recommend Budweiser to anybody."
Budweiser,2.2,"It really shows just how bad Americans taste is when Budweiser is one of the top selling beers in the country. Compare Budweiser with those from Canada, Germany, and Ireland, just to name a few, and Budweiser doesn't hold a candle to them.
Budweiser is a really, really sad commentary of a lager. That's why I drink German beer."
Budweiser,2.92,"Pours a very clear and pale yellow color with a white head. It has the taste of a decent beer when you drink one ice cold and paired with food like pizza, burgers, and Bar-B-Q. Haven't had one in a couple of years, but I still like it."
Budweiser,4.33,"Budweiser goes good with almost any food, tacos, hamburgers, hotdogs, and is a good beverage to drink while hanging out with friends and watching sports."
Budweiser,4.78,"Just a good and inexpensive traditional American lager that the snobs hate but everyone drinks and likes.
Its consistent and refreshing on hot summer day."
Budweiser,1.59,"Last beer I reviewed was an exquisite, delicate Pilsner that paired insanely well with a good pizza. The boys over at Weihenstephaner sure know how to do the right balance of complex and nuanced flavors, along with a nice delicate, simple beer that is worthy of their brand.

With my reviews, I've mostly been doing beers I love or like, so my reviews are skewed in that way, but today I review a beer that I feel isn't all that great, and that's Anheuser-Busch's beer, Budweiser.

COLOR:

Light and clear golden color. It does look pretty good when poured right. The head fizzles out and dies though, which should be an indication of what I should expect.

AROMA:

Smells tart and cheap. I got a weird, funky skunk smell. Just smells bad.

BODY AND PALATE:

It has the memory of a lager. All of the classic flavors are there, they're just incredibly thinned out. This tastes as if you wanted a beer and somebody shouted the classic lager flavor profile from another room. It tastes cheap.

Add some corn syrup taste and feel to this and you basically have a Budweiser. I love me a good Pilsner and a nice, refreshing lager, but this is definitely not the King of the Beers. More like a serf.

FINISH:

The finish isn't too bad, and not out of the ordinary for a typical lager finish. And I guess that's sorta the problem, isn't it? Nothing really stands out and intrigues your palate.

CONCLUSION:

This is nothing but dorm room beer. It's cheap, it's readily available, and for playing drinking games it has its place. But now that I'm 32 years old, I'm not after quantity, I want a nice, quality beer, and this beer just tastes like water to me.

This beer basically took those classic and delicate flavors of pale lagers and Pilsners that people love, and thinned them out, because they're after mass production and not a nice, refreshing, quality beer at the end of the day.

Overall, it gets a 2.5/10 for me. It tastes like the MEMORY of a lager or Pilsner, and is only good if you've just reached drinking age, you don't have a lot of money, and all you give a shit about is getting shit-hammered."
Budweiser,4.35,"""Best by 10/6/22""; drank 7/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through dull orange/yellow appearance.

An even pour yielded a nice off-white head; strong, frothy lace.

Sweet corn, fresh bread & faint strawberry (?!) notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, mild raspberry & faint caramel flavors.

I'm stunned by how much I enjoyed this; my beer budget is about to plummet!!"
Budweiser,3.43,"It’s hot dogs and brats on the grill, fireworks and a Bud!

I assume I’ve had a Bud before, but the last time was at least 40 years ago (probably longer). And I have no specific memory of it amongst a sea of similar beers.

The 4th of July seemed to me to be as good a time as any to give it a proper tasting.

I reduced the temp of my smaller beer ‘fridge specifically for this beer. The ‘fridge was at about 38°F when I removed the beer. The beer was at about 40° when I started tasting.

Clear, pale yellow, lightly carbonated body topped with a tall white head, thick and creamy-looking with retention on the short side of moderate. Nice looking for the style.

Pleasant, if weak, aroma. Malty with hints of sweetness. No complexity, but still nice.

Light flavor of malts. Smooth in the beginning, and remaining such throughout. Some (but very little) bittering appears in the late middle and carries through to the finish. As with the aroma, no complexity, but still enjoyable. The aftertaste is mild and lightly malty with slight bittering. The overall taste is just a little on the sweet side. The finish and aftertaste are more malty than crisp, ending, again, just on the sweet side. (The slight sweetness of Budweiser is apparently one of the differentiating factors – according to other reviews – from the other top-selling AALs, but I like it.)

The mouth feel is thin, decent carbonation feel, and surprisingly creamy (in a light sort of way).

Overall, I am surprised that I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In flavor and in body, it certainly beats the heck out of the plethora of light/Lite® brands from these macro brewers.

One additional comment: unlike some other macro lagers – and even some non-macro lighter lagers, this beer does not develop off-flavors as it warms. It remains pretty much as it started.

NB: The following rating is with style in mind, but it also is a fair reflection of my enjoyment of this beer. Imagine that. I think I'll crack a second!"
Budweiser,3.74,"Bud was the very first beer my friend gave me, years ago. It was warm and probably past it’s expiration. I didn’t even finish it before throwing up. Didn’t drink beer again for over a decade and a half. Now I know what I like and enjoy exploring different beers and saw the tall-boy cans of Budweiser for sale on the 4th of July with the word “FREEDOM” inscribed on the front. I decided I should revisit this for the sake of knowing what it actually tastes like. Surprise! -it’s not as horrible as the beer aficionados claim. Neutral flavor of very mild hops, malt, and sweetness from the rice. No off-putting flavors or aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. It’s not something that one drinks to contemplate life’s mysteries, but maybe just to stare into a camp fire or watch the stars. It’s good enough to cool you from the heat of your bbq grill. I will say that I had some *ahem* bathroom problems later that I can’t help but attribute to this beer… but overall I cannot bring myself to look down on Budweiser any longer."
Budweiser,5,"Picked up a case of bud cans today. Maybe it’s the special summer “freedom” marketing that gets me, I don’t know. This beer pours perfectly, golden with a glorious white head. Smell and taste are slightly crisp like green apple cider, not too heavy, not too sweet. It goes down smooth and I actively want to chug it. This is a Beer I long ago dismissed but now I think I might just be a bud man like my father was."
Budweiser,3.14,"I just had to write this.I am an IPA fanboy who hits all the taprooms around the city.I hopped on BeerAdvocate to read up on Budweiset.
I tried a Budweiser tallboy because 5% abv around a pool in the summer makes more sense than my 7.2% IPA.
It ain't that bad,geekheads.And you should know that because we ALL drank Bud at some point of our lives.It's not your local's pilsener/lager that costs twice as much,but it is a decent brewski for sitting with friends.And for all of you reviewers that keep talking about corn this and corn that...Bud uses rice,not corn, as the adjunct,so shut up already.I can't drink Busch because of that corn;Bud doesn't have that problem.
Bud has a neutral,but pleasant taste.Doesn't smell like much of anything.Goes down smooth and easy.
I prefer IPAs,but I am not ashamed to drink this.And neither should you be."
Budweiser,3,Budweiser is fine not the best of brews but it’s decent. I prefer ipas but Budweiser is okay I won’t drink it regularly but it does have its place
Budweiser,4.91,"Waaaaaaaaay too many beer snobs in here like they are reviewing a fine French wine. It's beer ffs. Get over yourselves. I ascribe to the German proverb that there are no bad beers....some are just better than others. I drink very high end stuff, and then I drink this. Beer Advocate peeps are obviously partial to IPAs. That's cool..I like them too, but I really get sick of them too and want something simple like Bud or a Naragansset. I don't know why I bother reading the reviews on here. Very predictable. If there were blind taste tests, the reviews would be different. Drink what you like. Cheers!"
Budweiser,2.65,"Poured from a 16oz can into my weizen glass. Best before 5-14-22

On the pour a giant head forms even on an average pour 3 plus fingers but it quickly recedes to just a ring of larger bubbles around the rim and a few pods of bubbles floating on top

Aroma is tart and largely smells of cheap lager. Some BO notes not great and not a lot of malt either just off. And this is still a month before the best before. Bad.

Taste follows the smell but brings notes of corn. Still mostly tart water fermentation character. Some buscuity malt aftertaste but that fades to the taste of popcorn kernels. No bitterness, just fermentation, BO and grain. Still not a lot of flavor though.

Feel is crisp and easy to put down with a lot of carbonation bite for the style this is perfectly acceptable. Not overly watery on the sip but it doesn't stick around long. Not the best.

Overall perfectly drinkable and pretty predictable. Seems like it moves quick everywhere so it's not too risky if you can deal with the standard off flavors. Certainly not a standout, and I wouldn't reccomend pouring this in a glass."
Budweiser,2.49,"Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.

Syrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.

I am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.

So, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!"
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.26,"Time to knock out another style topper! Here we have the highest rated Irish Dry Stout on BA, and one that has apparently held similar titles for a long time per the notes ""Cadillac Mtn. Stout was selected World Champion Dry Stout 1995 and the best hard-to-find beer in America by Men’s Journal."" Cool shit. Let's see if it can live up to the expectations I've built up in my head after having this marked as a ""want"" for 3 years

Pours a muddy medium brown with a finger of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

As expected, the roast is very evident in the nose, but it is nicely balanced as well. I'm picking up on aromas of acidic coffee, dark toast, charred malt, toffee, sweet honey, herbal hops, and cocoa powder

It's also quite smooth in taste for the amount of roasted malt that's present. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt toast, caramel, herbal hops, and dark cherry. The swallow brings notes of acidic coffee, cocoa powder, earthy hops, dark toast, toffee, light raisin, and a touch of char

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a roasty and slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and surprisingly refreshing

Yeah, this shit is awesome. Super easy drinking even for a style where drinkability is pretty important. Definitely deserving of its ranking. I think I'll have to stock up on more now that I found it"
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.3,Lovely beer. Drank it at the brewery which was a great place in the woods. Not much head but lovely taste. Quite a coffee vibe going on.
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.16,"Pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a finger of beige head. The nose has roasty notes but also something sweet and almost toffee-like. Roasted malt is the feature of the flavor profile. The finish is gently bitter.

I could drink this offering all night. no wonder it's the #1 Irish Dry Stout."
Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.74,Meh. Bitter
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.36,"Overall, an excellent iteration of this style. Very roasty with tangible hop bitterness and a reasonable ABV. Prefer this much to Guinness. I’ll have another please."
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.25,"Now brewed by Atlantic Brewing Company since the owners of Bar Harbor Brewing retired

L -- Murky deep brown body with a two-finger light tan head produced with moderate pour. Some retention and lacing
S -- Milk chocolate, nougat, barley malt, molasses, touch of spice
T -- Nutty coffee, cacao powder, brown sugar, maple sap, well roasted malt, herbal hoppiness. Really nice, smooth, low bitterness finish
F -- Easy drinking and semi-fluffy. Hint of sweetness throughout. Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Just a little watery around the edges

Cadillac Mountain Stout,4,"12 oz bottle. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops, roasted malt, toast, dark fruit, some coffee. Body is full, creamy and slightly crisp. Taste is of nutty, roasted malt, grassy hops, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar and dried fruit. Finish is long and bitter. Nice stout."
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.1,"Completely black,just above average carbonation. Great aroma,coffee,chocolate,and malts. Taste was the same,very flavorful,everything a stout should be. A thick heavy mouthfeel with an odd stinging bite that's hard to describe. Overall an excellent stout that I would definitely try again"
Cadillac Mountain Stout,4.05,had out of the bottle and it is truly an interesting stout. it is lighter than most. clean taste with a sweetness in the finish. very clean aftertaste and the mouth feel is also a bit unique. there is a bit of a sting or bite that is actually quite nice. this beer definitely exceeded my expectations.
Cadillac Mountain Stout,3,A brew that is dominated by coffee and chocolate malts...this is a decent stout but there is nothing that separates this from thousands of others that taste exactly the same.
Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.75,"It pours a dark brown and leaves a foamy off white head. Minimal lacing occurs and spider webs apart. The smell is roasty between coffee and chocolate notes. The taste.takes those flavorings to make it sweet. The palate is about a medium to heavy with nothing harsh on the tongue, slightly sof and creamy. Id say its fairly drinkable. Overall, this is a good standard American stout that I would gladly come back to."
Cadillac Mountain Stout,3.79,"Pours a pitch black color with a finger of khaki head. The head has little retention, leaving nothing in the way of lacing before settling into a thin, bubbly halo.

The aroma is all roasted malts with a hint of vanilla cola and black licorice. Odd but pleasant.

The flavor brings notes of roasted pecans and almonds, followed by tootsie rolls and licorice. Finishes with a faint touch of hops. I should hate this but I don't. It's pretty good, actually.

The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth. No alcohol presence.

Overall, a pretty good and very interesting stout. It's a bit too sweet, but never cloying, and it has a nice creamy body, like your mom."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.64,"2021 Lottery bottle. Poured at 57°. Black with ruby edges; dark tan head fizzled out quickly; poor cap retention, thin ring, a few spots of lace; thin legs on swirl. Bourbon nose with cinnamon, sweet plums and green chilies right behind; some boozy heat on the retro nasal. Taste follows nose; more sugary plums and sweet bourbon; figs, molasses and brown sugar; very light chocolate/cocoa nibs; bourbon and dark fruit finish. Hot bite on tongue from peppers and booze; full minus body, not at all adjuncty; smooth, silky feel; full mouth warmth from alcohol (13.3%) and hot peppers. Overall, loads of well balanced flavors; base and barrel merge seamlessly; long sweet bourbon and dark fruit linger leaving cinnamon and hot chilies sauce aftertaste. A sipper for sure!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours black as night. A minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. Tiny bubbles throughout.

The nose is insane. Big toffee and dark fruit. Raspberries come to mind right away, but after a few minutes that fades a bit. In comes cocoa nibs, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, and coffee.

The taste is amazing. Coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon are apparent. Maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. However, the cinnamon and coffee are strong. Flavors are intense.

Mouthfeel is pretty thick and the beer is clearly low in carbonation. Overall, a wonderful and intense beer!"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.59,"Look - Fantastic thick black with a nice tan head lacing and rimming
Smell - bourbon woody caramel cinnamon vanilla blend, boozy
Taste - nice woody caramel bourbon carrel with a nice cinnamon vanilla cocoa with a very light spice
Feel - medium full body with a slight cirsp
Overall - incredible"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,5,Older bottle. Stunning
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.82,Covid screwed up Huhaphu last March and I got some perks because of it. Wife and I travelled to Tampa from the Daytona area for a day trip and CC had a small trailer set up with several of their best brews there to taste. I NEVER thought I'd have this but am so glad I was able to try it. Amazingly smooth and apprecibly tastier than regular Imp Stout (which is great). Yay Cigar City
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.46,"Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts.

The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful.

Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish.

Thick and full bodied."
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4.63,"500mL bottle into a snifter
Vintage 2021

A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75

S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75

T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel
aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75

M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4

O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5"
Oude Gueuze,3.84,"12.7oz corked and caged bottle. Dating badly smudged, but at least 4 years old.

Looks okay in the glass. Hazy dull orange body. Head dissipates very quickly, no lacing.

Somewhat funky on the nose, even a little cheesy. Barest hint of green apple.

On tasting, a little dry, quite sour. Mild funk, more green apple than the nose suggests.

Mouth barely reaches medium, finish a lasting dry sourness, spikes of bitterness now and then.

Overall, has its merits, but not as good as I was hoping for. Cork was a bit grubby on the edges, perhaps a mild contamination issue?"
Oude Gueuze,4.25,"12.7oz green corked & caged bottle notched BOTTLED IN D 2016 (nearly 6 years old) poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright, soft medium amber in color with short lived, nearly white head. The head recedes to a few scattered bubbles about the perimeter of the glass. No lacing. The aroma is intense (like you can smell it while taking the picture) lemon, orchard fruit, horse blanket, funky cheese and vinegar. The taste is sour, overwhelming so to my palate, but I don't generally care for sour beer. Digging past my initial instinct to quit this bottle immediately, I get waves of citrus, big vinegar, and funky ass bleu cheese. Mouthfeel is thin bodied, highly carbonated and bone dry. Overall, I will capitulate to the BA overall rating of world class for a Lambic Gueuze and rate it accordingly. However, I would not serve this to a sworn enemy dying of thirst..."
Oude Gueuze,4.27,"12.7oz green bottle. Label has bottling date as 'D' (December) '2018'.
Cloudy, pale amber/apricot colored body. Brief off white head. No lacing.
Aroma is leather and grass. Very fragrant. Like its body color there is a hint of stone fruit apricot.
Taste is sour, with tobacco and leather flavors. Also some cut hay. There is the apricot fruit here. The intensity mellows in the aftertaste, with a hint of fruit and oak remaining.
Tart mouth feel, with a drying sensation. Very good carbonation.
Somewhat like a sour white wine, but still somewhat complex."
Oude Gueuze,4.21,"Sample from bottle at RBNAG 2014, Halden, Grand Tasting. Golden colour. Lovely brett aroma, lemony and farmhouse notes. Even better sour flavour with loads of brett and lemony notes."
Oude Gueuze,4.39,"Bottled: April 2016

L: Pours a deep gold with light to light-medium haze. A slightly aggressive pour produces a white 2 finger head with some slight retention. After about 2 minutes the head has faded to a 3 mm ring around the circumference of the glass while the middle of the glass has a thin splotchy sheet of bubbles.

S: Lots of lemons, a hint of green apple, acetic acid, and some earthy and woody funk.

T: I get lemons riding throughout the whole palate with the barnyard funk coming in mid palate and riding to the back end. The back end is the aforementioned lemons and funk but accented by some green apple, oak, and a hint of earth. The finish is pleasantly tart.

F: Light to light-medium body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is prickly with a bit of dryness on the finish.

O: Complex and well balanced between the fruit and funk with a bit of oak to tie it all together. One of the better gueuzes I have had the opportunity to try. If Iambics are your thing this is highly recommended."
Oude Gueuze,4.3,"Blend of 2016, 2017, and 2018 lambics, so this was likely blended in 2019

New year, new beer! I'm very excited to try my first Gueuze, and planned to open it for New Year's Day 2021 (more like New Year's Night at this point). Let's just jump straight into this

Pours a cloudy orange gold with just a thin white cap that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing, the carbonation is very visible

A lot of fruit and funk dancing around in the nose. I get notes of apricot, underripe peach, lemon, horse blanket, sharp oak, sweet malt, and a small touch of tobacco, oddly enough for a beer like this

The flavor evolves quite a bit throughout the sip here. What starts off smooth and balanced in sweet and sour, turns into a funky dry tartness. It starts with notes of lemon, white grape, crisp but full malt, and buttery oak that reminds me of chardonnay. The swallow brings notes of sharp oak, leather, tart and funky apricot, apple skin, vinegar, and a light floral character

A light body pairs with moderate carbonation for a very refreshing drinking experience. It feels light than the abv, but finishes a touch too sticky

This was a damn good beer, and I'm happy to have tried the style! I know there's better ones out there, and I'd love to have more. Happy New Year's BA, cheers to a better 2021!"
Oude Gueuze,3.88,"L: Crystal clear amber color, massive four finger but quickly dissipating white head, no lacing to speak of, good carbonation.

S: Fruity, sour.

F: Medium bodied, nicely flavored, smooth.

O: Nice sour."
Oude Gueuze,3.67,"375ml bottle from Beers of Europe (£4.99):
Sort of orange amber & cloudy with a 1cm, foamy white head that settles at a thin circumference lacing with a single patch in the middle. Sour with tart & fruity esters upfront but it's not as overpowering as some, I got a little orange & peach with a subtle acidity with apple & a white wine aroma towards the middle but it has a nice balance with some lemon & yeast at the end. It's more tarty with the taste, a lot of grapes & vinegar acidity with some funky flavours, lemon & strong floral flavours. It's yeasty & sharp with a sour, tangy finish. It's strongly carbonated & crisp with a light medium body that looses some of the initial balance as things go on."
Oude Gueuze,4.34,Strong Carbonation and sour predominant taste. Lemon notes. Not as fruity as Krieg lambics I’ve had. Very nice beer though. Bottled 04/2016. Opened 8/2020.
Oude Gueuze,4.21,"Golden wheat with slight fizzy head, a loose ring persists

Sour oak, citrus yeast, lemon and orange peel, apricot, faint whiskey.

Tart, light-medium body, drying, leaves a nice oak fullness

Very good, even better with some age, this was about 2 years after bottling. Worth a try if you like sours"
Oude Gueuze,4.23,"375 mL Bottle. ABV 6%.

750 ml green glass bottle, corked & caged; bottled in November 2015
$13.39 on clearance @ Roger Wilco, Pennsauken, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: Removing the cork I got a whiff of that funky, vinegary beauty. How can something that would normally smell really bad be so good? It's poured a hazy golden orange body beneath a short cap of bright white foam. I'm surprised that the head is holding up so well because they normally just drop away to nothing in sour beers. It's on its way out though. Back to the aroma, it's musty, sweaty, acetic, oaky, horsey, earthy, and fruity with sharp apple, dried apricot, pear, white grape, and lemon juice. It's pretty impressive, although if you've never tasted a gueuze before you might turn your nose up at it. On to the flavor... well I hate to tell you, but it's pretty much exactly as the aroma suggests it will be. Beyond some doughy malt it's a little leathery, softly peppery (black pepper), and there's some wet straw to it, but I'm not really finding more beyond that. As you might expect there's really no bitterness to it but it still finishes quite dry, with a bit of earthiness, crushed granite, and pepper lingering. In the mouth it's a touch astringent, and light-medium in body with a gently caress of very fine-bubbled carbonation which is all that's needed along with the pinch from the acidity. It's been a long time since I've had another gueuze of this caliber so it's hard for me to say where it might fit into the world of gueuze but it's pretty damned good.
Review #6,738"
Oude Gueuze,3.99,"16.9 fl oz bottle from November 2016. Poured into a tulip glass, a hazy orange with little to no head after the initial bubbling wears off. Aroma is tart and sour, with pear and apple notes. The flavor is right in line. Oak. Carbonation is slightly above medium. First I have had of the style, so I don’t have much to judge it against. Seems pretty good if you like sour , pear/ apples."
Oude Gueuze,3.29,"750 at home with Lisa, bottled Dec 2013.

Huge green apple off the bat on the nose. Big acetic acid vinegar in the nose and taste as well. Really bad. It opens up a bit, but you can't get around the vinegar.

I have another bottle, hope this was one bad bottle. Really bad."
Oude Gueuze,4.35,"Pours a clear, pale golden amber coloration with a medium, fluffy, quickly dissipating head and visible carbonation. Smells of doughy malt, tart white grape and apricot, blue cheese funk, hay and yeast esters of green apple/pear and peppery spice. Taste is a great balance of light doughy malt, strong, tart and zesty, fruit notes of apricot, white grape and lime peel, as well as more estery fruit notes of green apple/pear and a medium, slightly musty, blue cheese funk presence, with just a hint of hay, peppery spice and oak as well. Finishes with a medium tartness and acidity and some fruity notes, funk and oak lingering in the aftertaste. Effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

An excellent, complex and well-balanced Geuze that's up there with the greats in my opinion. Very enjoyable indeed."
Corona Extra,3,"What can I write that hasn't been written or said of this beer. The highest selling Mexican beer in the World. The greatest marketing of Mexican Beers. It is the introduction of most to Mexican beers. At 4.6% abv, simply inoffensive. It's only commandment- Thou shall pair it with lime. Reminds everyone of the beach. If there's a category of girl friendly "" chick-beer"", - this is it. Corona's downside, or greatest marketing, is the clear glass because the longer in the shelf the worst it taste. Beer is so light and inoffensive you can drink it at church or a funeral and people wouldn't mind."
Corona Extra,3.93,Yum. A touch of skunk and coarse prickly carbonation. Brings back memories of my teenage(young adult I swear) years.
Corona Extra,3.19,"I mean, it’s a Corona—not bad on a hot day with a lime and some Mexican food. It tastes a bit skunked, but that’s what the lime is for ;). It is so easy to guzzle that twenty years ago as a college student I’d have six at a time. These days almost anyone’s local brewery probably makes a better Mexican lager, if that’s what you are in the mood for."
Corona Extra,3.84,"Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly fizzles away.

The aroma is slightly sweet, green apple and corn with hints of flower and grass.

The taste is pretty much the same as the nose. Green apple skins, grainy, lightly sweet, hints of corn, a little bit of white flowers and grass on the back end. Zero bitterness. Finishes as crisp as the aforementioned apple.

Mouthfeel is...fine? Light but not watery. Fizzy. Drinks like a pretty typical carbonated beverage. Super crisp and clean, though. Almost nothing is residual.

Wow. I was surprised by how much I liked this, at least from this format. A skunky bottle might have given me a more negative impression. This is a solid, refreshing corn lager. If you go in thirsty with no aloft expectations, you'll probably enjoy it, too!"
Corona Extra,3.38,"consumed straight from the 12oz clear glass bottle. typical cheap, easy drinking lager smell and taste. nothing fancy but i think that’s the idea here. i can kind of see why they add a lime to this beer as it helps offset the somewhat “cheaper” beer flavor with some citrusy zest. decent mouthfeel though. it’s got some bubbly carbonation and crispness to it. it’s not a half bad thirst quencher on a hot day. personally, i’d take modelo or pacifico over this."
Corona Extra,2.79,"Poured into a pils glass from a 24oz can best by December 2022

On the pour a decent head forms then immediately dissipates entirely. Body is a golden yellow with average carbonation, crystal clear.

Aroma is skunked, even in the can. I wonder if getting the beer lightstruck is part of the process. It still has some detectable not ruined hops but even so there is some cheap lager aroma here as well. Not bad but not great. Some vague sweet malts are detectable under everything else going on.

Flavor is quite similar to the smell, but with less lager flavor although retaining the skunkiness. Some hop bitterness is there but the skunk is present the whole time. A corny light and sweet malt finish does come eventually after a weird tartness subsides, no wonder people drink this with lime.

Feel is easy drinking crisp and very highly carbonated. Quite light but has a surprisingly long finish that is actually pleasant.

Overall this is a pretty flavorful lawnmower beer that still feels light. Hops are present unlike a lot of beers in the category but there's also a lot off about it. Nothing disgusting as I think a lot of it is intentional but I've had better."
Corona Extra,2.56,"Bottle poured in a Pilsener glass clear yellow liquid with numerous active carbonation streams . Produces a frothy two finger white head , settles to a thick layer , clinging lacings , looks good

Aroma is adjuncts and malt

Taste is water flavored beer

Light mouthfeel , I can see how these get guzzled

What starts off looking pleasing and appealing quickly subsides when you taste it. There just isn’t much, if any, taste.

Pass"
Corona Extra,1,"Worst beer ever. Bottle lets in light, cheap label, cheap beer. Adding salt and lime is just stupid. Only dumb college kids would do something so moronic. This is an embarrassment to all beers. This beer is far worse than anything listed on the worst rated page. I would not even cook with this beer. Plus, you are supporting a country that enables human trafficking and drug trafficking."
Corona Extra,3.51,"2022-06-15
24oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. BB DEC 2022.

Pours very clear pale yellow, an initial flash of moderately coarse head that disappears to almost nothing except for a few straggling tiny clusters of bubbles. Moderate amount of active carbonation. Smell is yeasty funk, grain, maybe corn, slight grassy spiciness.

Taste is fairly mild, but dominated by the yeasty funk. Grassiness follows, then maybe a little grainy sweetness. A surprising bitterness builds, and I get a little lemon zest.

Mouthfeel is super light and clean. Overall, it is what it is -- it's not bad, it's not going to turn any heads, but you could drink a few of these on a hot day."
Corona Extra,2.63,"I don't find this a horrible beer. It's just not that good either. Someone stated that if you don't add a lime, you're doing it wrong. My feeling is that if a beer needs citrus fruit to be drinkable, they are brewing it wrong. Most of the popularity of this beer is a good PR campaign. Keep in mind that this beer is popular in a country that bought pet rocks."
Corona Extra,2.5,"This is the epitome of an average beer. It is just fine by definition. Add a slice of lime to make it more tolerable but in a pinch, a corona is not the worst thing out there."
Corona Extra,2.71,"Unremarkable, mass produced beer. This is my go to when options sparse. Like tequila it is best served with a salted rim and a lime slice,"
Corona Extra,2.83,"This beer is so average, until you put a lime in it. Something about this beer in a lime with it makes it phenomenal, cant really tell you why. This is an amazing beer with a lime, super refreshing"
Corona Extra,2.52,"I would never purchase this outside of accompanying my meal at a Mexican restaurant, but it does indeed serve that purpose. IMO it's only purpose. MUCH prefer a Modelo Negro if available."
Corona Extra,4,If you don't throw a lime in and salt the rim you're doing it wrong.
Corona Extra,5,Great beer highly drinkable ... beware if you get skunky ones ... make sure to buy in the 12 pack box .. dont allow alot of light to hit it ... they become skunky when the hops go bad with light ... should be smooth tasting with no skunk flavor.
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.07,"Picked up a 500 ml can from TW-Greenville, SC 6-8-22 for $2.49. Canned 11-8-21; best by 11-8-22; consumed 8-29-22.

Beer poured a chilled golden orange with a very nice long lasting white head.

Nose is very nice; banana and clove are very prevalent.

Taste is a light wheat malt base that allows the yeast to show forth the yeast properties that give forth banana, bubblegum, and a touch of cloves. Finishes balanced but lacking a burst as the flavor kind of falls away.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth.

Overall a very nice hefe!"
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.31,"Huge dense white head, well laced, under a cloudy gold body. Aroma is just what you should expect of the style: yeast, banana, cloves, a touch of spice and floral hops. Soft, grainy flavor incorporates what the smell is providing in a neat, balanced package. Creamy, lightly carbonated, medium bodied mouthfeel."
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.63,"Appearance: Cloudy, gold. Mousse-like, frothy white head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Yeasty esters of banana, clove and fruits.

Flavor & aftertaste: Semi-sweet, bitterness is barely noticeable. Yeasty flavors mixed with grains and bread.

Mouth feel: Full bodied, creamy and soft. Medium length finish with a slight trailing bitterness.

Overall: Poured from a pint can. Excellent Hefeweizen. Expect nothing less from Paulaner and other German based breweries. Typical yeasty aromas and flavors with the signature creamy, soft mouthfeel. Virtually no bitterness. Right up there with Weihenstephaner, Ayinger and others. Just a bit short of Schneider Weisse Tap 7, which is quite unique. Very enjoyable."

Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.15,"Well this is my 4,000 beer review which I had a couple weeks ago at my little nephews 3rd birthday party. I remember it being rather warm at the time so to me it gave off a bit of metallic skunk taste but when I had it but it did have a great level of Bubble gum esters some wheat and and good dose of banana and coriander. At this the time I did wish I had a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier and I still stand by it since those are more clean and I could drink those all day.

Smell: So sweet. Bananas, of course, and vanilla pudding, cloves.

Taste: Very much in line with the nose. Banana, toffee, sweet bread, green pear. Nice mild hops in the finish, slightly herbal. Delicious.

Mouthfeel: Soft and creamy, goes down very smoothly.

Overall: A classic Hefeweizen. I didn't want to stop drinking."
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.61,"First impression? Not my favorite. It just seems a bit darker than other Hefeweizen’s, and it has too much seasoning going on (just like every time Aunt Betsy cooks Thanksgiving dinner). Now, don’t get Raul wrong; Aunt Betsy is legit, and I’ll shotgun a Pabst with her any day of the week; but I guess I just like lighter Hefeweizens with, dare I say it? Maybe a tad bit of bubble gum to them. Yeah, I dunno…all of a sudden Raul is thinking when he should be drinking. I’m outta here.

Every now and then try and remind the ones that you love that you love them, my minions."
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.29,Really good wheat beer!
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.4,"Fantastic mouthfeel. Wasn't sure on the first sip, but every consecutive sip tasted better. A no BS wheat beer."
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.96,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle

The look is just a touch lighter than an amber, with a decent haze but you can still see through it pretty well, translucent I guess. Pretty decent carbonation but not the most intense. It's an attractive beer for sure. Head is less than one finger on the pour but retention is very impressive maintains a fine cap for as long as there still iGerman. No lacing though.

Aroma is obviously very yeast forward with strong banana orange smells almost like a wit beer but just malt and hops. In the back a nice dry malt aroma.

Flavor follows the aroma but less orange notes and more dry fermentation notes. A light acidity going on here. A light malt aftertaste rides along with some banana chip notes for a clean very vaguely bitter finish.

Feel is all from the head bringing a nice creamy mouthfeel from fine bubbles, but still light enough to be a nice warm weather beer. Also has a big enough body to bring it to year round status.

Overall a nice traditional hefeweisen pretty balanced and as usual not a lot of hops. Not sweet but not bitter a nice yeast and malt beer here good if you just want something actually german."
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.09,"Best by 10/22

This is one of the classic Hefes, and other than Weihenstephan, I haven’t had many of the German examples of the style. Surprising, considering Weihenstephan is one of my favorites of all time and I enjoy the style. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

This one takes a sweeter approach in the nose that I quite enjoy. I’m picking up on aromas of banana, sweet honey, bready malt, pear skin, bubblegum, and earthy wheat

While this tastes pretty good, I think it may be overly fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy wheat, banana, orange zest, doughy malt, and clove. The swallow brings notes of banana, raisin, bubblegum, earthy wheat, bready malt, pear skin, and light herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry but again the fruity notes shine too much

Despite my one nitpick with this beer, it is delicious. A nice session beer"
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.25,For my personal use only: Very drinkable wheat beer. Doesn't have the sometimes harsh coriander taste. Need to buy a sixpack and try it a few times.
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,3.89,"Poured from the can, the look of this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Opaque, thick looking beer with a thick creamy white head, lines of bubbles rising from the bottom, streaking you the brownish-red body of the beer. Striking look in the glass.

The smell is a strong point for the beer, mild banana, orange peel citrus notes, backed by a malty-bready smell.

The taste is where a lot of the really highly rated beers on here fall a bit for me. I won’t deny that it might simply be my expectations are too high. Despite that, the taste is still phenomenal compared to almost all beers out there, it’s just relatively straightforward. Citrusy clove taste that waxes and wanes with a very mild peppery taste. Very sweet wheat taste, though not as powerful as the smell would indicate. A little creamier than other weissbiers! Which I enjoyed. Plentiful carbonation without too strong of a bite makes it taste very smooth and creamy.

Love that malty wheat flavour on the exhale"
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,4.24,"A lot of Authentic marketing and feels for this european beer, but it lives up to it. I can only hope and dream that this is what central europeans drank in the 1600s. Good color , taste and finish."
Old Stock Ale,3.99,"Pours the color of translucent apple cider. Not much of a head.
Smell and taste strong on the malt, slightly sweet up front with a lingering bitter finish that's not unpleasant.

Old Stock Ale,4.01,"12 oz bottle
Bottled Year: 2018
ABV: 12.0%
Glass: Snifter
Serving Temp: room temperature (about 71 degrees F)

Look:
Before a swirl or two of the last of the bottle it's a clear dark copper-to-mahogany. Afterwards (with the swirl results poured in) it is a murky mahogany brown that cannot be seen through in a snifter. A maybe 1"" creamy beige head thins to a consistent cover.

Smell:
Caramel with some brown sugar. Candied sugar and red fruits like currants and plums. Some dates and perhaps grapes.

Taste:
Rum-soaked raisins and currants. Spiced plums. Honey. An earthy note rolls around in the background. Dries some as it finishes. Aftertaste has notes that remind me of Tawny Port.

Feel:
Slightly tingly carbonation. Medium body. The alcohol warmth is noticeable and builds as more of this ale is consumed.

Overall:
A wonderful sipper on a cold night. Nice and warming. I picked up quite a bit of sweet notes; a bit more than I prefer. But good nonetheless. I have a couple more that I will cellar at least one more year (when they will be 5 years old). As others have said here, you don't want this beer too cold. Or cold at all."
Old Stock Ale,4.49,"2021 bottle poured into mug.

Overall: Great ale. Nice malt and flavor not too sweet.

L: poured into mug and had a thin head that went away pretty quickly and left a thin ring. Great lacing though. Dark tea color.

S: little bit yeasty at first that gives way to more malt and caramel, maybe some fruitiness but I can’t really put my finger on it

T: lots of malt upfront that flows into caramel and very slight hop bitterness at the end. Hops are hardly even there at the finish. Little bit sweet on the finish. Overall lots of malt.

F: lower/ standard carbonation. Creamy on the finish that lingers for a good 20 seconds"
Old Stock Ale,4.37,"No idea how I'm just finally reviewing this, but picked up 2021 batch and just enjoyed it as always. Superb malt bomb, absolutely deliciously crafted with minimal hop presence. Gets pretty boozy as it warms which is to be expected. Yum, yum, yum. This is classic stuff."
Old Stock Ale,4.3,"2018 12% ABV.
Slightly murky reddish amber pour with a half finger of tawny coloured head.
Smell is malt forward with raisin, date, caramel and a bit of a plum like fruitiness.
Tastes of caramel sweetness, raisin, date - malty - boozy brown sugar and a bit of that plum fruity note - hint of leather.
Super smooth, full bodied - sweet and boozy warmth - wonderful sipper."
Old Stock Ale,3.58,"Has an incredible caramel top note. If caramel is your flavor, this is your beer. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying its too sweet. Its a very high quality caramel. The finish is agreeable. I hesitate to say is maltyish. There are many beers more malty than this."
Old Stock Ale,3.64,This one was fairly easy drinking for having an ABV above 11%. It was pretty smooth and reminded me of a Barleywine without the sweetness. It was very thin and the flavors quickly faded. Would not really seek this one out again.
Old Stock Ale,4.25,"Brownish color, medium body, medium carbonation. Very malty !! Doesn't really taste alcohol despite higher ABV. There some fruity background taste, also comes through smell. Others mentioned cherry, that could be it, I can't tell. Regardless, this is fantastic beer !"
Old Stock Ale,4.67,"2021 bottle poured into snifter. Mahogany body. Thin beige head that gives way to a thing ring.

Nose is peaches, plums, honey, sweet dark bread.

Taste follows, with some chocolate, brown sugar, and dessert wine notes.

Smooth medium body.

Really good. A beer to be savored."
Old Stock Ale,5,Absolutely Amazing in every way.
Old Stock Ale,4,"12 fl. oz. bottle, 2007 vintage, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.7%. Dark reddish brown colour, slightly hazy, big beige head. Strong aroma of sweet sherry, oak, malts and caramel. The flavour is very sweet and malty, again with strong notes of sweet sherry and caramel, ending in a hoppy bitterness. Powerful stuff, a beer to sip slowly. Should not be drunk too cold."
Old Stock Ale,3.96,"2021 vintage, 11.2% ABV

I suspect that this young beast will be very hot, considering it was bottled this year. For some context, the 2013 Old Stock Reserve is one of my top beers of all time, #7 to be specific, so this base version of the beer has pretty big shoes to fill. I don't have all that much to say, so I think it's time that we jump into this thing

Pours a murky medium brown with 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing, pretty damn impressive for the style and abv

Immediately I notice that this isn't anywhere near as sweet as the 2013 Reserve, with more of an old, noble hop aroma dominating. I'm picking up on aromas of red grape, sweet molasses, apple, earthy hops, toffee, and some fusel alcohol

The taste eases up on the old world hops, but I'm still getting the feeling that this beer is much to young to enjoy to its full potential. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sweet papaya, tingly alcohol, raisin, and a touch of dark toast. The swallow brings notes of red grape, red apple, brown sugar, plum, earthy hops, spicy alcohol, fruity yeast, and a light nuttiness

A medium full body pairs with tingly carbonation, resulting in a smooth slow sipper. Finishes mostly dry with a decent sweetness

I wanted to like this more than I did. Like, a lot more. That being said, it still wasn't awful, I just don't think I'll ever try it fresh again. Hopefully I can source another bottle and cellar it for a few years and see how it's changed"
Imperial Stout,4.18,"an interesting stout, thanks again to my bud Austin at the big beer store in Omaha, super dark, good body, complex but smooth, rich, very good drinkability, I like it, not sweet, but not bitter either"
Imperial Stout,4.12,"500ml bottle, date codes: 27.05.25, 17.08.21, 2468
Look: nice looking beer, black body that doesn't let any light thru, nice medium brown head that leaves some lacing.
Smell: chocolate, dark fruit, roast, brown sugar
Taste: follows the nose, plus a hint of red wine, cherry wood, and maybe coffee. Smooth. Not really all that bitter. Has some sweet notes to it. ABV is well hidden. Not harsh in anyway
Feel: good, not thin, low carbonation

A solid beer, I like it, 4.10/5"
Imperial Stout,4.03,"Served in a snifter glass from the bottle.

Appearance: Semi thick black body with medium bubbles creating tan head rising roughly quarter of an inch off the body.

Smell: coffee aroma which comes and goes...it's strong but not one that lingers.

Taste: Heavy malty and bitter beer with another dose of coffee. It's a simple imperial stout though, not a lot of complexity which I have had compared to others.

Mouth: Sticky beer which stays with you with a medium to full carbonation and strong body.

Overall: Good brew, wouldn't hunt it but it's descent enough that you will remember it. Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing. Salud!"
Imperial Stout,4.2,"Bottle. Almost black. Dark tan head. Dense with strong retention. Marked lacing.
Smells of toasted wholemeal bread, cocoa rich chocolate and raisins. Deep and complex.
Taste as per aroma. Some hops make a subtle appearance. Charred bitter finish.
Full bodied. Tingling carbonation.
Great beer that would be fantastic with a softer feel."
Imperial Stout,4.55,"Picked up at the Oslo airport. Poured from ,33L bottle into shaker pint glass. Bottled on 08.05.18 (May 8th), best before 08.05.22
A: Pours an extremely dark brown...thick...with a generous 2-3 inch super dark mocha head with excellent retention.
S: Chocolate, molasses, leather, wood, and a hint of smoke. Rich and dense.
T: Dark (and a bit dry) chocolate, leather, wood, smoke, and molasses. Follows aroma very closely. Luscious.
M: Moderately heavy body. Thick, velvety smooth, and creamy feel. Mildly dry and bitter with dark sweetness. Lingers nicely on the palate. Absolutely wonderful. I rarely give 5s, but this is perfection.
D: Wow!! This one blew me away. Simply fantastic for style. Well done, Nøgne!"
Imperial Stout,4.5,"500ml poured into tulip glass.

A rich looking deep black stout; moderate head which is perhaps a bit lighter in colour than you'd predict. Smells of everything an imperial stout should smell of; treacle, chocolate, dark fruits and a touch of coffee. Tastes magnificent with an incredibly soft mouthfeel. Alcohol barely discernible. Dangerously chuggable; this is an excellent brew and I will be hunting for more.

Cheers!"
Imperial Stout,4.15,"Poured out with a huge mocha coloured head, gigantic frothy cream actually. Jet black beer. Lacing sticks around, fine small bubbles.

Smell is excellent. Huge toasty malts and raisins. Hint of chocolate, some figs and prunes and dusty coconut sugar. What I look for in a sweet imperial Stout. Lovely.

Taste delivers on the promise of the aroma. Raisins, figs, brown sugar. Slick, low carbonation and a molasses/maple syrup sweetness that sticks to the lips. No hint of alcohol for me. Just flat out sugary malt, in a good way. Hints of sweet whiskey, burnt toast, licorice, meaty roasts, and some salinity. Fantastic, right up my alley.

Great stuff. Happy to have this in my home province."
Imperial Stout,3.9,"Nose presents elderberry, rye toast, nuttiness, & loads of molasses, with hints of toasted walnuts. Flavour is remarkably different than the nose, beginning with hints of grassy celery, immediately followed by dry gingery cola, with hints of cocoa & milk chocolate, finishing with plenty of dry smokiness trailing out to hints of raisin. The palate is very dry, with somewhat moderate body. Skilfully & enjoyably crafted!"
Curieux,4.5,"First of all, I am 80 and have been drinking beer all my life. Love the high ABV and cost is not a consideration. This is one of my favorites and would buy again. This brew is from a 12 oz. bottle and I am enjoying it very much."
Curieux,4.14,"Soft, pale yellow body; partially cloudy; thick, dense, sculpted head, white and long lasting; heavy sheets of foam coast the glass. Nice aroma of honey, clover, light bread-y malt notes; slightly herbal. Mild malt flavor infused towards the finish with a nice bourbon undercurrent; spicy, anise and coriander; slight bitterness. Medium body; mild coarseness; balanced alcohol heat presence; rather dry overall.

This is an interesting and tasty take on the tripel beer style. The appearance, smell and taste all point towards its tripel baseline, delivering some nice spicy character. The bourbon barrel aging develops midway through the sip and lingers into the finish. The brewery's label description of ""subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak"" weren't really perceived by me (perhaps in hind-sight I can agree with the caramel and oak points - but they didn't really standout to me). I like the beer and am glad to have one additional bottle of this beer.

Pouring temperature: 50 °F; bottling data: BOTTLED ON 05/19/22"
Curieux,4.31,"L - Golden with a white head that dissipates somewhat slowly and leaves a cap behind
S - some bready belgian yeast, oak, some spices, but otherwise pretty faint
T - bready belgian yeast, some banana, light spices followed by a good amount of oak, vanilla, smooth bourbon, and some caramel.
F - light to medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation.
O - a pretty interesting brew. Starts out like a typical Belgian triple, but follows with a ton of barrel character."
Curieux,4,Pours a deep gold. Light foam. Fruity aroma. A lot going on here. Dried fruit and vanilla body. Not too sweet. A little oaky. Alcohol finish. Well balanced. A must try.
Curieux,4.06,"12oz bottle courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ. According to the stamp on the label, this was bottled on January 19, 2022. My first Allagash beer in somewhere between 15-20yrs. Once upon a time they were distributed here, but, sadly, that pipeline dried up long ago. I've missed them.

Poured into a Chimay goblet, this was a dark golden amber color, with a thin, bubbly, off-white head.

Fruity and spicy nose, in that order. Not that dramatic. As it warms, a little bit of boozy, bourbon-y sweetness becomes noticable.

Taste is considerably more complex than the nose. It's where the barrel aging becomes apparent. Fruity start, reminiscent of apple juice, and then things get oakey. The bourbon barrels add, in addition to notes of bourbon itself, a vanilla-like aspect, and there's a definite alcohol heat in the background.

The body is light for a 10.2% bba beer, but is definitely not truly light bodied. Mouth feel is lightly creamy.

Is this a Belgian golden ale or a tripel? If this was a Belgian tripel, as it's called here, I find it a bit lacking. I think there should be separate style when it comes to American and Belgian tripels. As an American-brewed Belgian style beer, this is pretty awesome, but it doesn't have that authentic Belgian feel or look. Then again, I've never had a true Belgian-brewed tripel this high in alcohol, at least as far as I can recall, so it's possible one wouldn't have the big, fluffy head one normally associates with Belgian abbey ales. It's very close to being a great beer, but doesn't quite get to that point for me. Anyway, style quibbles aside, I enjoyed this. The bourbon aging didn't drown out the golden ale flavors but augmented them. It's too boozy for me to want a lot of in a sitting, but this was a great beer to drink as a bit of a reward after getting some work around the house done."
Curieux,4.24,"12 oz bottle poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a clear golden yellow/straw color with a huge white foamy head that slowly recedes leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing.

The aroma has a lot going on, with some banana, apricot, vanilla, peppery spice. Not much actual bourbon aroma, but there is just enough to hint at the barrel aging. Very nice and inviting

The flavor is toasty and lightly bready with some fruity notes. Banana, apricot, coconut, and vanilla complimented by a peppery spiciness, and a sharp finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall this is a nice beer and coming in at a big 10.2% you would expect more booziness, but the alcohol is well masked, making this beer easy to drink. A great example of a style that I took way too long to come around to…"
Curieux,4.22,"Bottled 4/22/21 . Let sit out for ten minutes , before opening.

Moderately hazy, with 1/2 finger of quickly-dissipating off-white head.

Smell is candied orange rind , with slight barrel aromas (oak & vanilla) .

Taste is similar to aroma, but with the orange rind element less jammy . Slight spiciness, and light bitterness. As it warms, more oak tannin becomes apparent.

Feel is slightly slick , light-medium, with moderate, very,very fine, soft-ish carbonation. Actually feels fairly light for the abv. No apparent alcohol presence.

Overall, pleasant, and surprisingly easy-drinking for what it is. I'd never guess that it's > 10% abv, if I hadn't read the label.

Feel is"
Curieux,4.52,"Bottled 11/18/2015
Poured golden honey in color and was topped with an off white head.
Aroma spoke of simpler times, fresh herbs and hops and malts and dancing in the sunshine. No bourbon did I get, but no complaints from me. Wonderful nose.
The taste rather follows. It seems after 6 1/2 years any bourbon from the barrel has been reduced to insignificant proportions. But what remains is a very tasty triple."
Curieux,4.35,"Poured a hazy light gold with a half finger white fizzy head that dissipated quickly. Nose of mild banana, citrus and subtle bourbon. Light tastes of banana, malt, and hops. Medium bitterness and heat like white pepper or cloves. This gives way to a sweetness and oak most likely from the bourbon barrels. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. The booziness becomes pronounced halfway through the drink. This beer started out on a bit of a ho hum with me and then really grabbed me."
Curieux,4.39,Really a great treat! A smooth intoxicating ale that feels and tastes delicious!
Curieux,4.49,"Pours a golden yellow with soft, soapy head.

Smell is fruity and a bit yeasty with soft notes of bourbon, oak and sweet vanilla. Some traditional Belgian notes of dried fruit and banana with a hint of toffee.

Taste is fruity and a bit sweet. Notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee and some hints of dried fruit and banana chips. Very well balanced, letting the barreling really shine. Soft bitterness with a slightly phenolic finish.

Mouthfeel is medium and smooth with frothy carbonation.

Overall, a terrific meeting of traditional Belgian beer and modern barrel aging. Tremendous stuff."
Curieux,3.01,Not a huge bourbon fan and this is extremely bourbony.
La Fosse,4.12,"B3, drank March, 2022 out of a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.

A classic that lives up to its style but too acidic for my tastes. Apricot shines through, smell was great, and I’m glad I got to try it and certainly did enjoy the experience of drinking it, but I had a hard time making it through 375 ml."
La Fosse,4.34,"Blend #3.

Pours a golden-copper with notable floaties and particles suspended in the beer. Head is a finger of white foam. Aroma is lemongrass, herbal, stone, and apricot. Apricot isn't forward, molding into the surroundings for a subtle twist of sweetness. Nose has a light tanginess to it, but it's faint. Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a near still effervescence. Overall, soft and plump, just like a ripe apricot.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle."
La Fosse,4.34,"Gold in color with a faint haziness. There’s just a trace of off white on top. Smell is of fresh apricots and faint lactobacillius. I’m tasting tart lactobacillius with a sweet apricot finishz. The mouth is dry, crisp, and refreshing."
La Fosse,4.83,"I had this right after having Fuzzy at the tasting room in St. Louis and they are neck and neck. I may actually prefer La Fosse, because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from Fuzzy more significantly than anticipated."
Beatification,4.3,"Pours a beautiful gold with a clear transparency. No head formation. Aroma is green grapes, chardonnay, slight red grapes, cellar stone, grass, and mild oak. It has a light lactic twist at the front that is quickly soothed out. Acidity is mild. Flavor profile presents a clean arrangement of green grapes, chardonnay, pinot noir, cellar stone, and oak. It's slick, smoothly bouncing between each note. Mild grassy and zesty hops add a little further texture. Sourness and acidity is minor. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a glassy, still texture. Overall, a refreshing wild ale that melds into wine notes well. Easy drinking and not forceful or brash, making for a more tasteful sipping experience.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 357mL bottle. Bottled on 04/03/20, consumed/reviewed on 07/21/22."
Beatification,4.14,"Brief Review:

O: My 3rd “-ation” sour from RR. Either I’m just not into this American-style wild ale, or these are overhyped, but I just haven’t been blown away by these sours. They’re good, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think I’d seek them out again. More sour than tart, quite dry on the finish. Lacking in any true funky flavor or character.

Recommendation: At this point, if you’ve had one RR sour, you’ve probably had them all."
Beatification,4.68,"Had at the brewery in Santa Rosa. Finally a chance to drink this. Their menu referred to it as a “Sonambic”, a Lambic from the Sonoma Valley. And wow is it impressive. A truly funky, wild, fruity masterpiece."
Beatification,4.75,"#123, solid"

Beatification,4.34,"Bottled 4/3/20

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing

Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin

Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma

A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness

This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day though"
Beatification,4.22,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $15.99. Bottled 4-3-20; consumed 1-6-22.

Beer poured a cloudy golden with a little head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is very nice, very funky and horse blanket forward, along with some acidic vinegar qualities, true to the style.

Taste is a light malt base that has some lemon and apple. The funk, horse blanket, and touch of vinegar blend in very nicely without overwhelming the palate. Finishes tart.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and neither overly refreshing nor smooth.

Overall this was my first RR sour, and it is very nicely made!"
Beatification,4.71,"First time having this. Bottled on April 3, 2020.
Poured in a Wine glass. Beautiful hazy yellow/orange. The more I poured the darker it got. Smells like an earthier version of Supplication. Taste is bursting with pears and sour apples. Touch of citrus. And if course it has that excellent Russian River wild ale signature yeasty finish. Wish I could get this daily. Russian Rivers Wild Ale line up is really remarkable and I hope it’s available for as long as I live."
Beatification,4.04,"Bottle pour- looks like a glass of apple juice ,no head or lacing with a smattering of quickly disappearing bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Nose is sour, earthy and funky. Taste follows with hints of oak, a lingering tartness and a flat finish."
Beatification,4.58,"Brew: Russian River Brewing Company – Beatification

Intro: 375 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Golden yellow to light orange in color. Minimal to no head

Smell: Acidic is the first term that comes to mind. Second term, dank

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Tart citrusy taste.

Mouthfeel: Cuts through everything. Definitely a pucker up front but subsides as you drink.

Drink: Follows along with mouthfeel. Not something I could drink a lot of at any given time

Conclusion: I’ve had more pleasing but I’ve also had a lot worse (for me). It’s pretty much one and done as with most wild ales with me."

Beatification,4.19,"Review 1544
I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles.
Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal.

The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor.

The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright.

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish.

The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again."
Beatification,3.62,"Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.

375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.

""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.

HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.

BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.

I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.

AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.

I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.

Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.

I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.

Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.

Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.

Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.

I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.

OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.

I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

B / GOOD"
Beatification,4.47,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a stemless wine glass

Look: Crystal clear straw gold with a thin bite head that dissipated quickly

Smell: Very Brett and funk forward. Jay, green apple skins, pears, salinity, oak.

Taste: Light and clean. Green apple skins, pears, white pepper, barnyard funk, light sweet tart and oak.

Feel: Light and clean. Almost aqueous. Drinks so well. Light acidity. Sweet with and off dry finish.

Overall: Just beautiful. I wish the carbonation was up a bit but overall this is a beer that needs to be experienced. The sum is greater then its parts. A description doesn’t do it justice. Pick it up if you see it."

It just hits me, it caresses me ever so softly. And if I could, I would caress it back. Slap me, baby, I’m happy. Slap me, beautiful, because I am alive.

Good day."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.45,"Midnight black body with a tan shallow head. Roasted malts fill the nose but have molasses, earth, smoke and dark bitter chocolate supporting. Frankly, I am in love with how rugged the flavor complexion is of this throw back stout: roasted and earthy malt with accents of smoky coffee, tobacco and earth, meet dark chocolate and black strap molasses on the second half that just glob onto the palate. Taste is just that tick more intense while still being drinkable. Which brings me to the feel, mirroring the taste, strong roast but refined by the finish with the bright sweetness of the molasses, robust yet smooth and quaffable."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.5,"Pours deep black color. Aroma is intense dark chocolate, caramel, coffee and booziness. Taste is a balance of the nose - bittervdark chocolate, coffee and booze. Mouthfeel is perfectly full.

Overall an incredible stout."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.46,"On draft at the brewery. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, khaki-colored head of foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass.

Berserker Imperial Stout,5,"Hi fellow beer bro's! I'm the great Eric Lambino and I just wanted to pop in and say WOOWZEE WOWSERS this beer is a flavor EXPLOSION. From the caramel notes when it first touches your lips, to the smooth cocoa middle, to the crescendo of coffee to follow this beauty is a symphony of satisfaction. A melody of malt, a diddy of delight! Please, for me, the great Eric Lambino, give this beer a chance.. your life will never be the same again. Lambino out."

Berserker Imperial Stout,4.1,"12.7% no bottle date seen.

Pitch black in the glass with a pinky worth of thick, caramel colored crown capping it off. Crown settles in to being a thick ring attached to the glass and a misty island covering the rest.
The nose brings dark, unsweetened chocolate mixing with hints of fruit. There is an almost peaty, smoky quality to it. That barrel really comes through with the charred oak.
The taste brings in that unsweetened chocolate again before turning into huge waves of dark fruit and charred wood. Sticky molasses and dry tobacco also show through. Maple isn’t too noticeable or overpowering anywhere in this thing, which is good for me.
The mouthfeel is sticky, medium bodied thickness with a smokey, charred quality of dry wood to it.
Overall, this is very well blended between all aspects."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.55,"Appearance - The beee poured a tar black color with a mocha colored head.

Smell - The nose was decadent with notes of rich dark chocolate and booze.

Taste - At the front, there were notes of dark chocolate, light coffee, maple, and coconut. The bitter notes helped to balance the sweet. The booze was the bond that held it together in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - The viscosity was a touch below used motor oil with low carbonation.

Overall - Newer, trender beers may have taken this one’s place in the top 100, but it is still very solid and worth seeking."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.22,Poured 8/3/2018 from a 2017 bottle. Taste is identical to ten fiddy. Blind taste this to a little aged ten fiddy and it’ll be impossible to beat. A little deflated but still good. BA ten fiddy beat this for sure. Little to no maple or molasses come thru. Good stuff tho. Won’t seek out again
Berserker Imperial Stout,3.93,"Bottle share. Dull pour, flat and oily, small ring of brown head. Aroma is harsh and wooden. Taste smooths out a little, Dirty, earthy, peaty, a bit of alcohol warmth, bitter at the tail. Salvages itself after a questionable start.Vintage pour, definitely gets better with she. Smooth, sweet and boozy"
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.79,"A - Midnight black, thick tan head with tiny bubbles that dissipates in about a minute.

S - Powerful, with prunes, molasses, bourbon, and other dark fruits.

T - Malt, prunes, molasses, bourbon, hints of oak. Not quite as strong as the smell.

M - Very thick, and a little flat. Not too syrupy.

O - Powerful smell and milder flavor. Easy to drink and very tasty."
Berserker Imperial Stout,4.24,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber with no clear bottled on or best before date. Poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Black in colour with a one finger brown head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass while leaving some sparse lacing.

Aroma: Molasses, brown sugar, maple, chocolate, banana bread and bourbon with hints of coffee and oak.

Taste: Sweet molasses, milk chocolate, maple, dark fruit and bourbon with hints of oak, bitter char, smoke and coffee.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, medium to full bodied with low carbonation.

Overall: Nice aromas and taste but perhaps just slightly too sweet for me. The molasses were also a bit overpowering and I would have preferred more maple coming through."
Berserker Imperial Stout,3.8,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle was cellared 2-3 years before consumption.

A: Motor oil black. Brown head settles out after a short time. Wispy lacing.

S: Blackstrap molasses, thick fudge sauce. Hints of roast and char. Smoke. Vinous in a pinot noir sort of way, with a lot of black cherry and blackberry. Oaky vanillins.

T: Thick fudge sauce up front. Acrid and burnt/roasty edge rides up. French roast coffee, smokey. Big wave of sweet and sticky molasses and maple syrup. Chocolate covered cherries. Black currant too. Vinous- Pinot Noir. Cedar. Warming bourbon, barrel char, and oak. Long finish as sticky sweet molasses tapers into a lingering smokey note.

M: Thick and heavy body. Sticky and coating- rife with residual sugars. Low carbonation further lets that texture set in.

O: A massive imperial stout. Big molasses and maple syrup additions sweeten things quite a bit, and actually to the point that they become somewhat cloying. Barrel aging and a good dose of roast and some acrid/smokey malt character struggle, and ultimately fail, to keep it enough in balance. Still enjoyable in smaller doses, as a slow sipper. Good as a digestive, or I'd pair it with a fruit-forward and hopefully tart/acidic dessert."
Crusher,4.23,"Poured from a can with no visible date into a teku. Can purchased on 8/15/22 from The Alchemist.

L- Beautiful opaque deep golden color.

S- Some “Dank” along with a hint of pine.

T- Up front piney bite, but not
overpowering.

F- Moderate carbonation , dry finish.

O- A fantastic DIPA! Not too sweet and
juicy, not too resiny. Just perfect!"
Crusher,4.6,5/12/22 Canned 2/23/22. This is one powerful brew. Flavorful. Hops forward. Perfect piney bitterness. Dry finish. Citrus. Thirst quenching. Could be a favorite. It is!
Crusher,5,I have tasted beer perfection and it’s name is Crusher.
Crusher,4.5,"Appearance - The beer poured a hazy golden color with a white head.

Smell - Hops were noted, with the presence of citrus and bitterness.

Taste - The overall profile was dank. It was oily with a nice level of bitterness. The profile of citrus fruits were noted. Even though it was on the heavier side, it could make for a nice easy drinking.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was appropriate, even with a thicker viscosity.

Overall - even though some might see this as a lighter beer, the taste comes with a heavier pprofile."
Crusher,4.14,Can courtesy of The_kriek_freak.
Crusher,4.25,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, Vermont for twelve dollars and seventy cents. My seventh brew from these guys. Good beer, prefer HT & FB."
Crusher,4.34,"Slight haze with a golden orange hue with a typical Alchemist unfiltered with detritus swimming about. The nose is large and overpowering in a good way - prepping your tastebuds. Spicy, piney, earthen, skunky weed and tropical fruit notes.
The patience is rewarded with complex resin hop notes - fresh hoppiness, dried hoppiness fully crushing on the palate. All those nose notes are there but dare I say the aroma outweighs the taste. Finishes will a touch of malt and some bitterness."
Crusher,4.75,"Lucked into this one as online purchase. Piney notes, wonderful. Alchemist has never let me down."
Crusher,4.25,"L: Hazy light Amber with a big bubbled head and very little lacing.

S: Pine, grapefruit, mango, and citrus pith hop aroma. Big peach esters. Also a fairly substantial candied malt character for the style.

T: Big pine resin, grapefruit, and mango/pineapple flavors. Substantial bready caramel malt balance. The bitterness is firm but never dominates.

F: Medium/light bodied, very dry, crisp finish.

Overall: I was really impressed with this one. I honestly prefer it to Heady, which is saying a lot. I cannot recommend this on enough."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.92,"Look - really nice thick dark auburn color with a big slight tan head and lacing
Smell - lots of caramel malts and piney hops
Taste - bitter piney slight citrus hops with a thick caramel malt backbone
Feel - thick body with a medium carbonation"
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.39,"Appearance – This, dirty pond brown had an appropriately moderate head.

Smell – The nose is powerful and equal parts toasted malt and heavy citrus hops with light lemon. This is a big balanced DIPA.

Taste – The monster hops step up at the taste but the heavy malts keep them in check. A sharp pine flavor shows up at the taste.

Mouthfeel – This full-bodied DIPA is moderately dry. I expected a super-dry finish but the caramel from the malts keeps it pretty even. There is absolutely no alcohol sting so beware of this 12.0 ABV heavy hitter.

Drinkability – This is dangerously easy to chug."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4,"12 oz bottle from 2015 (don't know bottle date) .
Poured dark amber, minor head dissipated quickly with some lacing.

Nose of a convoluted battle between hop, malt, pine, caramel and ?!? teriyaki ?!?

Palate of hops and hops interlocked in a battle with malts, caramels and pine. Semi thick mouth feel with slight sting left on the tongue. Higher AVB not really noticeable on the mouth but definitely warms the central nervous system after several quaffs.

This one aged rather well becoming smoother. Just the teriyaki aroma on the nose I can't place my finger on and seemed a little off.

Enjoyable."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.91,"Holy crap, this beer is kicking my ass and taking names. Twelve ounce can from Siciliano in Grand Rapids, poured into a 16 oz willi glass. Deep amber color topped with 2+ inches of firm white head that lasts longer than one of those My Pillows you see advertised on TV. Smell is a mix of pine, biscuits and pure, sweet alcohol. Did i mention this is 12%ABV? I cant remember because it kicked my ass and took my name. On the tongue this hits you with a well balanced but extremely potent mix of malt and hop bitterness (86 ibus) with tons or resinous pine, a hint of grapefruit, and dankety dankness to the max. Although I can smell the alcohol, the brew does a good job of hidi g it in the flavor profile. This is a great old fashioned true double IPA in the West Coast style. I love it but cant have another tonight because it kicked my ass and took my name."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.08,"A Malt Bomb, but it hides the Booze Well."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.5,"Bottled early 2016; drank 2/12/16 @ the Yarchives.

Semi-opaque ruby red appearance.

A rough pour yielded a nice eggshell head; a thick curtain of tree-rung lace.

Blood orange, burnt caramel & faint banana notes in the nose.

Medium thick mouthfeel.

Burnt caramel & faint banana flavors up front; dry grapefruit notes on the finish. No booze heat!

Decent American Barleywine vibes; I'm not blown away."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.09,"Poured from a single-serve bottle into a tulip...

Pours dark copper/amber with a slowly rising, and fast-clearing head, with good lacing/legging.

The aroma is heavy, especially initially, on the malts. Big, sweet, almost brown-sugar notes initially dominate, although there are citrus and pine hops notes in the background, as well as herbal, rather than typical floral aromas. The booze is there, but not overpowering.

The flavor is quite strong and unapologetic, yet somehow stays balanced. The malty sweetness is the first flavor to hit the palate, again with brown sugar in the forefront, but also subtle hints of caramel and biscuit/grain. The hops arrive to provide much-needed balance to save the day. Mostly pine notes, but touches of orange citrus (zest, flesh, and pith as well) with herbal/spice, leather and tobacco flavors, and a bit of grassiness. The booze is, again, definitely present, but remarkably blended--this is only a ""warm"" D(T?)IPA, not a burner.

The mouthfeel is actually rather remarkable. Despite the big malt-bomb presence, the carbonation is solid, and this brew never crosses over into ""heavy"" territory. Medium/full bodied, and definitely a sipper, it is still very drinkable.

I agree with others that the malt presence evokes comparisons to a barleywine, but the hops here are not an afterthought---they are a full partner. A true ""Triple"" IPA.. Another quirky and worthy brew from DH."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.26,"Whoa, damn, this one was good. Surprising flavors and oh-so-smooth. Looks great, deep caramel-amber color with some light tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells faintly of bitter fruity zest hops but then there’s a small punch of some sort of malty goodness. Tastes of mildly-bitter grapefruit zest hops and a little herbal hops, but then there’s also depth with toffee, vanilla, caramel and some roasted coffee nuttiness - flavors I didn’t expect in an imperial IPA. Nice malt backbone to balance everything out. Smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. High 12% ABV was very well-hidden and only as the beer warmed did the alcohol come through. Excellent!"
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.16,"Very attractive semi-lacey off-white finger-thick head and a beautiful caramel/amber color to the beer itself. Carbonation itself is even visually the perfect balance. The taste itself is impressively diverse. Butter-toffee, honey, and caramel notes balance out the tangerine, apricot, and grapefruit (not really, but what IPA review doesnt mention grapefruit?). Warmer, less fruity flavors seem to come through with almost coffee notes once it warms up a little. The 12% abv was deceiving. I had to look it up after drinking two and thinking something was wrong with me lol. Definitely a good night-time 'couple beers after work' drink."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,3.28,"This is a chill-hazed burnt amber beer with a thin khaki blanket that exhibits notes of caramel, wet pine, rug, and a surprising lack of the boozy heat I expected from it. The body is smooth and more drinkable that I imagined, but still not a favorite flavor-wise."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.03,"Pours a caramel color with an off white head that quickly fades, nice lacing. Aroma comes across as Orange rind. It has a sweet malty taste. This is an awfully tasty and dangerous beer."
Double Crooked Tree IPA,4.37,Great flavor
Trappistes Rochefort 6,3.5,smooth belgium style beer enjoyable but nothing special
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.13,"L - Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. 1.5 finger tan head on medium pour. Reduces down to a film. Not much lacing. Medium brown hazy color.

S - Bready malts up front. A little sweet.

T - Taste follows scent. Lovely malt flavors. Caramel and bread. Slightly yeasty in there. A little dry on the finish as it warms up.

F - Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a fantastic beer. Great malty flavors and no bitterness. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to anyone."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.14,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice, the ""best by"" date on bottle is ""L.23.11.2025"" which I understand to mean this beer was brewed on November 23, 2020 as the recommended shelf life is 5 years, price $6.49.

APPEARANCE: pours a light brown color with two-fingers tan head that quickly dissipated until a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, there is light lacing, medium carbonation for the style.

SMELL: subtle but pleasant to the nose, sweet caramel, banana bread and spice.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet caramel and some spice then banana bread on the finish.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, Belgian Dubbel is one of my favorite styles of beer and this one is very good, I will say the beer did not have great retention of the head and there was very little lacing on the glass although it was sufficiently carbonated and tasted great, I prefer Chimay with the red label but this is the next best Belgian Dubbel I have had to date, I would buy this again and would recommend to anyone who enjoys the style."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.25,"11.2oz bottle

Reddish brown. Smells really sweet and fruity, Belgian style. Banana and green apple and breakfast cereal, pretty creamy and powdery and high carbonation. Equal parts sweet baked bread and alcohol spice. Very tasty for 7%, and not as sweet as some other dubbels, but Chimay Red is better"
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4,"Good, unremarkable."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.25,Trappistes Rochefort 6 - smooth with a caramel look. Very solid and easily drinkable. Always a fan nice.
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.25,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber coloration with a medium, frothy head and some floaters on final pour. Smells of bready, caramel malt, toffee and fruity/spicy esters, with notes of apricot and clove. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt, toffee, fruity and quite spice esters, with notes of apricot and clove, as well as some subtle, floral and bitter hoppy accents, with just a hint of orange rind coming through as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and some toffee and esters lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This actually reminds me a lot of their Triple Extra, or perhaps that should be the other way around. The general flavor profile is rather similar, with this being a bit less rich and sweet, but still feeling quite satisfying. It does feel like a bit of a cross between a Dubbel and a Tripel overall though, being a bit lighter in color and more toffee-forward than your average Dubbel, while the flavor profile seems a bit closer to a Tripel than a Dubbel in general. Still, this makes for a very enjoyable brew in its own way, that's quite rich and satisfying, with a great balance of sweet, estery and slightly bitter notes."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,2.96,"I have never been a massive fan of Trappistes Rochefort beers...I have always preferred others such as Chimay...and I lived in Paris for 9 months and tried every one basically ; )

Mystical deep brown colour. foamy bubbly head.

Deep fermented, pruney aroma...

For me the taste does not have anything special going on. It is really smooth though. The aftertaste is the highlight...but overall it really isn't that different to a much cheaper or less famous dubbel. I am not really a fan of dubbels anyway...I like West Coast IPA's, hoppy pilsners and smooth dark beers...good complex mouth feel though.

A bit over rated in my opinion."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,3.61,"Look: Cloudy, honey colored, small layer of foam persists. It looks like really dehydrated person's pee.

Smell: very yeasty, hoppy, a little honey sweetness. not very fragrant though. I had to sniff really hard to smell these.

Taste: Its like drinking a lager with some honey mixed into it. It has an initial sweetness and then it mellows out to a bitterness. Kinda like honey caramel??? Malty, bready, honey, caramel. Kinda hard to drink by itself but I'd imagine it would go great with food! Maybe a red meat?

Feel: Really thick when it enters your mouth but then when you swallow it, it leaves a nice fizzy feeling that refreshes everything. Very interesting mouthfeel. Almost overwhelming in terms of how thick it feels but then it dissipates very quickly and leaves you wanting for more. Really compliments the taste of the beer as it has a strong honey/sweet flavor.

Overall: I think this is a great holiday beer or a great fall/winter beer. Reminds me a little of gathering around family with a nice warm spiced cider and your mother asks you if you have a boyfriend yet and you have to try not to sound THAT sad and say that you're just waiting for the right person, but in reality, you haven't had a date in a really long time and you are worrying that maybe there is something wrong with you and not that you are waiting for someone ""right"". But alas here are enjoying family time, so you push those emotions under and never speak of them. and its a very comfy beer."
Trappistes Rochefort 6,4.21,"Iced tea colour. Caramel, raisin & bread on the cup-cakey welcoming nose. Mostly dried fruit (cherries, dates) on the palate. More bread on the finish. Medium minor acidity & body. Quite fizzy. Shall do well with a cheese and charcuterie board."

Nectarine Premiere,4.51,"Bottled September 2020

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night"
Nectarine Premiere,4.9,"#95, yummy!"
Nectarine Premiere,4.63,"poured from a 750mL bottle into a stemmed taster glass. pours a foggy orange with minimal white head. huge fleshy, juicy nectarines on the nose and taste. a lot of funk with some oak impact as well. excellent mouthfeel. not overly thick but perfectly carbonated. one of the best dGs i’ve had the pleasure of drinking."
Nectarine Premiere,4.45,"this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile, so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share, what a gem! its as good as i hoped it would be, the nectarine popping in here, natural and juicy, the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver, and it seems right in its peak, bottle from september 2020. pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle, very fizzy but not holding a ton of head, and a nose that my mouth is still watering from, wow its puckery, nectarous, and juicy, ripe and sweet and sour at the same time, wood heavy, fully wild, incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms, more fruit, more funk, more wood. the flavor is fantastic, the fruit hits mostly at the end, its mature vinous funky wild beer up front, slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here, pils malt, doughy and crackery and simple but earthy. the ferment is sharp but not overly sour, tannic from the oak, maybe some white wine character too, lots of well developed bretty funk too. when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine, and it stays on the tongue through the finish. impressively real, forward, and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet, amazing. this has already developed well in the bottle, but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further. its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers, but the fruit element is as good as it gets. great carbonation here too, lively and excited feeling on the palate, fits the summery fruitiness. loved this, very thankful! i know this is one of their highest rated beers, but its probably not even in my top five from them, amazing as it is..."
Nectarine Premiere,4.34,"13 July 2021 - Beer #244 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade

Appearance: 4 - a lovely bright orange. Head fizzled away immediately.

Nose: 5 - tons of nectarine. I like those better than peaches.

Taste: 4 - mmm, interesting. It's a very impressive sour, but it's missing the blast of fruit I was expecting. Tastes a bit hoppy, if you can believe it.

Mouth: 5 - zillions of tiny bubbles. Expertly crafted.

Overall: 4 - reminds me of some of the best non-fruited sours I've had, but that's not what this is supposed to be.

Cheers!"
Nectarine Premiere,4.2,"To-go can, getting to finally try a Degarde for the 2nd time. The color looks stone fruit peach oranges. The smell is very distinct of sourness, vinegary, slight fruit notes. Overall I was hoping for that special first sip that takes my breath away but a bit disappointment bit nevertheless, it's good. Cheers"
IPA,3.92,"I haven’t had this IPA for a while. Good to revisit in light of all the unbalanced weird flavored IPAs I’ve been tasting in the past few years. Mildly hoppy, good malt backbone, standard fare. Good go to IPA."
IPA,1.76,Real bad.
IPA,3.75,"A solid starter IPA of the traditional back in the day variety, I drank a ton of it for a while - similar to, but inferior to in every aspect the great SNPA."
IPA,3.74,"pours a slightly hazed gold body with a billowing white frothy foam head that has moderate retention and leaves a ton of thin sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy froth cap with defined halo

aroma is sweet and grainy, malt forward with floral and slightly piney hops on the wings

taste is sweet and juicy, with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish

mouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation, running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed, juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness

overall:
solid session IPA that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness.
wouldn't consider it one of the greats, but it's in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft IPA flagships."
IPA,3.22,"Not one of the better ones I have had from Harpoon, but still solid enough to enjoy. Comparatively speaking, it's not as sweet smelling or juicy as others, but the mouthfeel was full-bodied which made up for a less than favorable taste. Again, when you take it all in, it's solid. Just not necessarily memorable."
IPA,3.95,"Look...darker brown copper with a white head and ample carbonation . The way IPAs used to look
Smell...faint smell of hops as the usual like many of the old school favorites.
Taste...Exquisite apricot, malt bitter with a very full body for the ABV. Back to the taste, apricot leaving to a finish dryness
Feel...A n ample carbonation that makes the consistency a little sticky and resinous. A great quality to this beer.
Overall...My belief is slanted such as this beer was a staple for a long time. This was my requested wedding beer that had to be there!! Anyways this beer was a very good one and still everyone should try. This beer was definitely a trail blazer out east."
IPA,3.36,"Scrappy notes from 2010.
6 pack of 12 ounce bottles purchased chilled.
This is probably the lightest tasting and lightest drinking IPA that I've had to date. It has a beautiful copper color with a nice white head. The nose is pretty full with hops that are flowery and some malt. The taste is mainly hoppy and is a bit thin or watery but tasty nonetheless. It has a nice light bitterness to it and drinks easy and fast. Not too shabby."
IPA,4.39,"The claim is ""New England's First IPA"" and that may be. Most beer historians credit Ballantine as being the first to brew one in the U.S., but that was in New York. Enough history, let's empty a twelve ounce can into a clear Imperial pint glass and review it. First, it's a lovely bright copper-amber with a sparse, but enduring white head. There's plenty of malt to be had by the nose. The taste is sharply hoppy, with the malt failing to keep up. The hops are boldly bitter, earthy, yet finishing dryly. This is a good bitterly hopped AIPA, lacking only a little malty counterbalance. It may not offer enough complexity for some, but this is a spot on traditional IPA."
IPA,3.92,"From a 19.2oz can, dated 04/05/21. Served in a willi becher.

Pours a crystal clear copper-gold with two fingers of dense, foam insulation-like head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, creamy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing. Honestly, I wasn’t prepared for it to look this good.

Nose is sharp, grainy and vaguely cider-like. Crackers and apple skins.

Taste is dry like soda crackers, crisp and biting. Apple skin, orange oil, turpentine.

Feel is crisp and clean, drying, medium bodied with brisk carbonation.

There was a time I drank quite a lot of this and I guess I wasn’t as stupid as I remember myself being because this is mighty tasty. The fact that it’s only a month old may have something to do with it. At any rate, the can label promises ‘hoppy, balanced, crisp’ and fucked if it isn’t all of those things.

(Replaces a 3.48 rating-without-review dated 05/17/15)."
IPA,2.89,"Overall this beer is just a snooze fest. Its a cheap beer and i get that, but this is not a good beer. There is nothing overly offensive about this beer but it just taste like water. Not what i expected for and i feel at this price, there are better options that will make you much more happy."
IPA,2.55,Nicedarker amber color easy drinking gives a good buzz not a bad beer low hop taste
IPA,3.19,"Sometimes you just need a break from the hazy IPAs that occupy every store and every corner of the refrigerator. And sometimes you don’t even want an IPA. This Pale Ale takes me back to some of my first craft beers, before IBUs started hitting sky high. And because of that it is like so many other pale ales, clear and clean, with a nice squeeze of hops and a refreshing palate that would be very difficult to replicate in a higher gravity style."
IPA,4.21,"This is a really nice, balanced IPA. It has a very clear, rich, honey color. The taste is a little bitter with bright citrus notes. It's pretty easy drinking, full feeling, and goes well with rich or spicy foods."
IPA,3.6,"From a can.

Pours a golden, copper in color with a thin layer of head. Not much lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks spot on. Aroma is very floral with some herbal spiciness, bubblegum and a toasty, biscuity malt backbone. Taste follows the nose surprisingly well. Spicy, earthy, floral hops with some lemon, grapefruit and pine balanced out by a toasty, biscuit malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with subdued but lively carbonation and a little bit of chewiness. Pretty drinkable. Overall a solid offering that is balanced and offers some complexity, but it's a bit too spicy/piney for my preference. Cheers!"
IPA,3.67,"Poured from 12 oz bottle, bottled on date: 01/06/2020. Nice golden color with a dissipating white head

Taste is hop forward, citrus to the back and hint of floral, distinct malt, but on the bready, biscuity side
Feel is medium bodied, but a bit too over carbonated
The first time I tasted this ale was at the end of 1997 and it was on draught at Christopher's in Cambridge and it was fantastic. It has lost that wonderful floral, malt smooth balance it had back then. But still a pretty good ale for the money (usually the lower priced option of the choices)
Edit: I have since read some other reviews and one or two have dissed the beer according to where they bought it on draught. Beware. There is a big variation in how this is kept in bars and restaurants. I recommend trying it local to Harpoon, Boston and in a place that looks after their beers, such as the brewery itself, of course"
IPA,3.95,"A classic on the Boston beer circuit since the mid 80’s and one that I consistently find myself ordering at restaurants and bars. A very reliably west cost style IPA that that tantalizes your tastebuds with crisped malty goodness. For those of us at 1009, this is the standard for the style that all others are compared to. For the love of beer!"
Samuel,4.61,"Finally cracking this bottle after getting it in one of the HF home delivery programs many months ago. Pours less billowy than many of the HF offerings, with little head retention or lacing to speak of. This is a superbly well-rounded and nuanced offering, with all of the characteristics of a rustic saison, a fine effervescent white wine, and a barrel aged sour all-in-one, with no one attribute dominating the others. $60/750ml is very high, but this is barely over into 'worth it' territory

93/100"
Samuel,4.23,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Mild vinous bouquet. Good stuff. Wine barrel gives way to tasty farmhouse notes. Not crazily complex but so solid, clean, and refreshing. A over average body and mouthfeel."
Samuel,5,"This one pours a golden and bright orange color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like hay, minerally funk, lemon candy, grassy funk, honey, oak, white wine, grape, sweet floral funk, and pear skin.

This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of. The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.

This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.

This is in the top 3 of all Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had, and it's maybe even the best beer overall that I've ever had. It's honestly perfect."
Samuel,5,Have had this several times. One of hills best
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.59,"Appearance: Arrives fudge colored with a beige head that settles in as a film but leaves plenty of lacing

Smell: The Tequila barrel aromatics dominate but there are lots of complementary aromatics of chocolate, spice cake, Bourbon and Brandy

Taste: Dark chocolate foward with hints of spice cake, brown sugar and vanilla; through the middle, the barrel tones emerge, with Tequila leading but the Bourbon and Brandy also in the mix; the finish brings all the flavors together with a slightly boozy edge

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet

Overall: Firestone Walker's barrel program is unsurpassed and this is a great example of their creativity"
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,5,"Providentially just got a 4-pack shipped in....

Pardon my less-refined lack of nuance, but it this batch was just as welcomely-received as any 'Parabola' or its variants.

Wow, looks like quite the internationally-sourced list of ingredients and influences... (doubly longing/lounging to revisit Orval about now...)

Mighty hit of the flat, opaque, thick, boozy, malty, salty, sweet, complex, and wood-burnished. Got 2 left, for a real milestone should i live so long.

One to grab!"
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.63,"Alright, alright, alright! (Cue the Matthew Mcconaughey grin)

Best smoked beer I’ve ever had. Balanced but still gives you a nice kachow in the kisser with that smoke bomb. Drinkable af but notable and memorable.

Im not a huge smoke beer person and about 1/2 way through a pour I’m usually pawning it off on the nearest buddy…but I’ve ordered this a few times now and drank every bit.

Definitely worth the try, even if it’s prying you out of your safety zone. Not trying it if you’re able should make you reevaluate your life and wonder if you’re having a “Failure to Launch” (bud dum bum pshhh-Matt joke)"
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.52,"L: Dark mocha pour with a thin sandy head and ample lacing
S: Smoky mezcal, cognac, and cacao nibs
T: Dark chocolate, hint of vanilla bean, toffee, baking spices, and a distinct agave syrup and black pepper underpinned by a gracious panela note
F: Medium mouthfeel with moderate carb
O: Very cool to finally try this one. The barrel aging is resplendent and evokes so many familiar, complex, and distinct flavors. FW performed a masterclass on this one as one of the best in the barrel aging game."
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.33,"Look - really great thick blackness with a nice tan head and lacing

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.23,"bottle into glass
The box label states that this is also aged in bourbon and brandy barrels, besides the tequila barrels.
Thin, light brown head. Darkest of chestnut color, with no sign of light through glass. A bit sweet, bourbonized toffee aroma, with a touch of spiced woodiness. Bold, sweetened, toasted wood and alcohol flavors to start, yielding to a slightly sharp caramel note. Finishes with the addition of dark roast and semi-sweet malted grain."
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.35,"Poured at fridge temp, but allowed to warm over a while. Pours straight black with a little bit of tan head. No bubbles apparent.

On the nose, I immediately get the tequila barrel. Chocolate, brandy, toffee, a bit of black licorice, and a bit of roasted malts.

The taste is liquid gold. Lots of black licorice right away. Some charred wood on the back end. Some nice dark chocolate in the middle. Dark fruit coming through as well. Cherries and blackberries. Brown sugar and vanilla starts to come out as well. Some dark German bread. Really nice flavor.

Mouthfeel is pretty thick, but not syrupy. Overall, a lovely stout."

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.48,Bottle pour 2021 version- dark as night with short lived khaki head leaving minimal lacing. Nose is a mix of boozy barrel wood and roasty malt deliciousness.

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.81,"From tasting notes in 2015

L- Jet black with small amount of head

S - Vanilla, roast, and tequila

T- This is a very unique beer, really enjoy the tequila backbone. A bit of sweetness but overall a very enjoyable beer

F - Thick mouthfeel

O - one of the most unique stouts I've had the pleasure of drinking"
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.48,"2021 Vintage

Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) with a medium sized dark beige head which stuck around for a while.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.

Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

Overall: A good bal-aged beer from Firestone Walker. The tequila and bourbon bal-aging work well together in the flavor profile. This one is a keeper for sure."
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,4.14,"There's been a weird undercurrent the last few years that 'there aren't good tequila aged beers'. This, central waters and fiftyfifty often come to mind when I hear that aforementioned incorrect opinion. Had this at the very first Firestone Walker Invitational. Quite the nice find. Did they also bring it to the Bistro's barrel aged festival a few years ago? I dunno, you always remember the first and then after that its like ""meh"".

Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang. Its a rather creamy beer that doesn't get bogged down in being oversweetened, fully hits the sweet spot but doesn't go beyond.

Its pretty good stuff and I could easily see dropping a nice penny to have this again. Its unique and very good."
A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,A wickedly balanced IPA loaded with hoppy goodness.
A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.65,The beer that made me fall in love with craft beer. So sad it's been discontinued but always hoping for a rebirth
A Little Sumpin' Wild,4,"Pours a clear reddish-brown color with little head. Scent is of citrus and hops, with the taste surprisingly bitter. Light-medium mouthfeel and an aftertaste dominated by bitter hops"
A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.16,"The appearance has a golden amber/maybe closer to a yellow colored body, one finger white foamy head that dissipates and leaves a nice spider web speckled faded looking lacing, light carbonation is seen rising. The smell is slightly sour and/or tart mango/lemon fruitiness up front, hops showing some pizazz. The taste is basically the same adding a bitterness from the hops that seem to be showing a bit more, lemony aftertaste, quick dry finish. The palate sits light on the body, pretty sessionable (perhaps poundable to some). Carbonation is somewhat sharp which is good for the style and I say good to me. Overall, I say this is a good Belgian IPA by style that I would have again."
A Little Sumpin' Wild,3.74,"Not at all what I expected, completely blew my mind. Belgian yeast at the front in the aroma and taste, nice silky body with small soapy head. Nice sharp yeasty finish."
A Little Sumpin' Wild,4.23,"Very pretty color, orange, full on 5/6"" of white head. Carbonation tight, aroma was interesting, lots of hops hitting those tropical fruit strides. Belgian yeast. This is what I imagine a first tier Belgian ipa to be like in this day and age. Give me some yeasty and hoppy competition.

Taste is both of those with a very dry and welcome finish. Hides the strength so well. A fun beer, doesn't seem to be as plentiful since its first year, but always a welcome addition, I dig it."
A Little Sumpin' Wild,3.92,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 6 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 8.85%, 1.082 OG and 72.51 IBU. It also note that it was fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain.

Appearance: The body has a deep amber color with a thick cloudy yeast haze. It’s topped off with a quick setting head of off white foam. Only a light thin film covering remains after a minute. Lacing is minimal and slick.

Smell: The aroma has sweet bready maltiness with notes of honey and then loads of pineapple, apple peel, orange peel and some pine like hops.

Taste / Palate: The flavor is full of sweet honey notes inside of a deep bready and yeast like base with waves of different fruity notes. My bottle is fairly well aged so hop bitterness is much lower than a fresh bottle. It also worth noting that the 8.85abv is not noticeable at all. The palate and feel are fairly full and smooth. Carbonation is low."
Daisy Cutter,4.54,"Can't figure out how to read the date code on the bottom but I poured the 16oz can into a pint glass at 63°F. Beautiful clear warm color. It tastes fresh and nutritious. Pleasant subtle flavor of barley but dry, not too sweet. Slight caramel taste. Not too hoppy. Nicely balanced. At 5.2 abv it's a smooth beer, even served at this warmer temperature. I'm glad I picked up four of these!"
Daisy Cutter,3.19,This beer is an easy consistent beer that’s accessible and in the Midwest and that has made it as one of my go to beers at bars and restaurants. It has a light feel. It doesn’t really distinguish itself from most other IPAs and I don’t really seek it out but it certainly gets the job done.
Daisy Cutter,3.99,"A bit of a foggy, amber pour, nice white head, some really nice lacing. Snot factory says, pine, citrus. To me this is one of the better Pale Ales, which are becoming harder to find. I think I need to buy this more often."
Daisy Cutter,4.17,"16 oz can poured into nonic glass. Iron Mike batch 062722. Enough hops to let you know you’re drinking a Midwest APA. A Chicago standby, nice one."
Daisy Cutter,3.75,"Taste is soapy, piney, floral. Overall I don’t understand the high rating."
Daisy Cutter,3.67,"Pours amber from a can dated 6/30. Smell gives off plenty of light caramel malts, some pine, and some residual fruits. Taste is piney bitter but quickly transitions towards flowers and malt, with some herbal elements. Finishes dry and coats the back of the tongue.
Overall a gem to drink, and a stellar APA. B+ rating."
Daisy Cutter,4.19,"Finally got my hands on one of these as I found this classic brew at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona when I was out there not too long ago. Like Sierra Nevada's flagship brew, this deserved to be rated high on here although it wasn't quite the gold standard that it's California counterpart has become.

This had a nice, copper hue to it was it was bright and topped off with plenty of offsetting head as the lacing left behind was somewhat extensive, but wavy and scattered without any hints of rings among the suds. Lots of bread, pine, and orange in the nose with some metallic hops underneath that, as the balance really shone through in the taste. Part fruit, part malt, and part bitter, this was nicely balanced, nicely carbonated, and easily enjoyable with some Caramel Malt, bread, and biscuit to keep the balance in check. as the earthiness became more apparent once this fully warmed up.

Not a lot of bitterness or burn to be had here, as the amount of alcohol was spot-on. Dated 3/3 on the bottom of the can with ""RECKONING"" written below it, there was a ton of pine and bitterness with some acrid lemon and enduring earthiness that left me wanting more. No doubt that this deserves it rating and classic status on here as I'd easily reach for it again, and a chaser of cold water afterwards!"
Daisy Cutter,4.24,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours orange yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of floral and citrus hops. Tastes of grassy hops with hints or floral and citrus. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."
Daisy Cutter,3.53,"Good orange gold color with light khaki head, 80% transparent.

Nose teased a bit of caramel and produce dept.

Taste was hop led bitterness and a rather restrained malt leading to a watery result for me

Mid bodied but the taste tilted it toward the leaner side.

I was expecting a bit more malt but perhaps I need more experience with the pale ale. All of my tasting scores of pale ales have been lower than IPAs for example."
Daisy Cutter,4.11,"Serving: 1 pint 3.2 fl. oz can (“01/19/22B… Rocky Top”) poured into a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Slightly hazy, deep gold approaching amber. Pours with an amazing rocky head of white foam that persists and leaves sticky lace along the glass.

Smell: Orange and lemon citrus, pine needles and biscuits.

Taste: Crisply dry and balanced, with plenty of citrus, piney and resinous hops along with nice biscuit and caramel malt body.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, slight oily feel, and moderate carbonation.

Overall: Timeless balance of hops and malt, fantastic West Coast APA."
Daisy Cutter,4.01,"This beer pours a dark golden color, almost amber. Quite clear looking. The head is 2 finger, white, frothy, and fluffy looking. The head retention is quite good, and the head clings to the glass to form nice lacing as it dissipates.
Nose is quite minimal. I do get a faint hint of hops that makes me think of pine.
Up front I get a nice malty biscuit flavor, slightly buttery. This biscuit doesn't last long, because the hops then kick in. They're not as strong as an IPA (of course), but they're there, and linger. The hops tend toward pine. There's also a slight earthy, grassy flavor here also.
Body is crisp, but also full at the same time.
Overall this is a quite delicious beer, and I'm glad we've got it locally now."
Daisy Cutter,3.66,Muted aroma but nice taste. Old school in a good way. Little bit of hoppy bite but not over the top. Clean and lively.
Daisy Cutter,3.84,"Look - Great looking clear slightly lighter copper color with a white head and sticky lacing
Smell - citrus, floral, slight pine with a caramel malt backbone. Very classic Pale
Taste - citrus, floral, pine and caramel malt backbone just like the smell. slightly bitter but not overly bitter like some classic pales can be
Feel - Medium body with a medium light carb
Overall - pretty standard classic pale"
Daisy Cutter,4.35,"Clean, easy drinking pale ale, almost like a dry hopped lager, very crisp flavor with excellent carbonation, hop profile with just a touch of juice, fruit (apple, lemon), herbs and spice (mint, pepper, pine). Refreshing, on the lighter side for IPA fans - as it should be. An extremely well done ale."
Daisy Cutter,4.04,"A dark gold color with a thick off-white head and plenty of lace
Aroma of citrus fruit, floral hops, and a hint of pine
Taste of grapefruit, caramel, and late pine
Medium-bodied, lingering bitterness."
Daisy Cutter,3.93,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a big fluffy off-white head that settles into a solid cap.

The aroma is of citrus and tropical hop notes. Orange and pineapple with a bit of spice in the end.

The taste has more bitter hop notes. I get some orange with a noticeable piney bite. Light pineapple provides some brightness. Sweet bready malt. Good balance.

Solid mouthfeel with semi-soft carbonation. Starts sweet from the malt but quickly transitions to the piney bitterness.

A fine APA. Plenty of hops flavors for the style though the hop profile didn't wow me."
Racer 5,4.75,"A CLASSIC !!! As WC IPAs go, this one should be included on every list. Golden, resinous and a heavier mouthfeel. Here in the southeast, it’s a welcomed standout when I can find it. Pick it up next time you see it, you will not be disappointed."
Racer 5,4.1,"Appearance: Pours a rich golden color, with noticeable hop oils, a frothy white foam head

Aroma: A really pleasant aroma Citric and piney. Bready and some caramel notes. Some fruitiness too.

Taste: Up front is piney. Citric and pineapple orange. Some malty hints too. A notable bitterness. The finished lingers, but not too long.

Overall: I've tried this many times before, but this is my first time taking notes. Really enjoyable. Easily one of my all-time go-to beers, when I want to guarantee I have something quality and delicious"
Racer 5,4.29,"Appearance: Clear, bright amber with a large white head and very good lacing.
Aroma: Pine racing to outshine the grapefruit.
Taste: Herbal, spicy, resinous, citrussy. Lingering aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Bitter, well carbonated, medium-to-full bodied.
Overall: Not easy to overlook (or understate) the 5's pedigree. One sniff, one taste will have you reflecting on the glory days of the well crafted American IPA."
Racer 5,3.82,"Pours a bright, foggy orange, quickly receding white head collapses to a ring leaving some spotty lacing. Nose gets citrus as do the buds, a nice caramel finish. Medium bodied, great continuing carbonation. I'd like to get this fresh...."
Racer 5,4.1,Very tasty for 7%!
Racer 5,3.91,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, light golden color with a large sticky, white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of orange, grapefruit citrus, stonefruit and apricot. Some caramel malts on teh finish.

Flavor: Strong citrus grapefruit and orange citrus flavors upfront. Sort of fades away in the middle. Some caramel and bread malt to finish. Moderately bitter.

Feel: Medium-bodied, moderate carbonation. A clean and moderately bitter finish. (3.75)

Compared to Bells' Two Hearted Ale 5/25/22: Pours lighter, milder aromas. More orange, grapefruit citrus. Less apricot, caramel, bitter pine.

Overall: A really drinkable IPA here. Nice citrus and some slight stonefruit notes. Then a clean and moderately bitter finish. Incredibly clean for 7.5%. This one would sneak up on you. Drinks pretty to style for a West-coast IPA. I don't know that there's anything here that makes this one special. Somewhat surprised by the 93 Rating on BeerAdvocate. Surely it's historical. Maybe my expectations were too high. Nonetheless, a good IPA and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 3.91)"
Racer 5,3.52,"Golden color with a quickly dissipated head. Hoppy but not overly so by todays standards. Tastes almost like a cross between a lager and IPA of today with a breadth of malt character. Slightly bitter after finish.

Overall this beer probably isn't as much of a knock out as it was when it first arrived, but it still holds its weight for sure."
Racer 5,4.43,"Disclosure: I've always enjoyed racer 5s and this was one of the first IPAs I tasted.

L: Beautiful deep gold color, somewhat hazy, white head

S: Aromas aren't too strong, citrusy orangey & grapefruit-like smell

T: sweet, bread-y, barley malt, orange and mango oriented taste with pleasant mild bitterness

F: Medium and soft mouthfeel with a finish that's dry (but not too dry),

Overall a very refreshing and enjoyable classic west coast IPA.

ABV 7.5 | IBU 75"
Racer 5,4.09,"Pours a golden with a moderate amount of chill haze, excellent head retention. Some pineapple and pine resin on the nose. Classic malty sweetness up front that gives way to grapefruit and drying peppery bitterness. It's slightly sticky but not super chewy. I wanted a West Coast IPA so I got this."
Racer 5,3,This is my first time trying it in 2021 and I could tell it was gonna be old school but this is just bore snore. Medium body with extremely light flavor. This is being dominated on by other breweries. After reading some reviews it sounds like fresh on tap is the preference instead of the cans and bottles on the shelf. Which makes sense. This can is 3 months old and just showed up to the store.
Racer 5,4.17,"Look: golden with a thick white head

Aroma: white bread, caramel, citrus, pine resin

Flavor: Slightly sweet, caramel and bready malts, citrus, grapefruit and slight pine resin, nicely balanced

Body/Overall: medium body"
Racer 5,4.27,"I ordered this on tap in Maui of all places and had low expectations going in. Wow did this blow those low expectations out of the water. Malty, citrusy, and bitter, the way an IPA should be. Since then I bought a not-so-fresh six pack, and it wasn’t great. I believe this partially explains the high variance of scores on this site. This beer is underrated for a fresh pour and overrated for a shelf turd. And while that is always the case, it is especially an issue with Racer 5."
Racer 5,3.6,Poured from a 335ml bottle. About 90 days old since the beer made the journey to Korea. Minimal head. Poured amber and slightly transparent for an IPA. Smells a bit sweet for the style. Taste didn’t knock me out but not bad. Nice balance of bitterness and slightly fruity. Feels full bodied. Little to no aftertaste. Overall a good choice but due to the limited availability here I’ll seek out other offerings from Stone.
Racer 5,4.31,"DATE: July 10, 2021... OCCASION: settling in for a comfortable evening after a long, enjoyable lake trip--why not unwind with a classic?... GLASSWARE : Maudite snifter... this pours a beautiful, glowing orange amber body alive with effervescence... its two-finger head is white and staunch, settling to a lacy ring... robust resin and pine, pineapple, lime and mango... hard fruits mix with thick malts to produce an aromatic balance to the hops--an aggressive yet controlled offering... a bit boozy too, but not at all intrusive or off-putting... active, lively at its introduction, strong in its presence and lasting in its finish... its citrus and resin shine here, bright and thick, puckerish and chewy... the grapefruit especially resounds in each sip, thick and appreciable... big, bold fruits make this worth returning to, a classic that is accessible, both in stores and in profile..."
Racer 5,4.04,"From a bottle at the Sixteen Mile House in Millbrae. Pours a cloudy amber. They claim to have launched the hops competition, and I believe it. Piney and grapefruit. The hops lingers, so I take a while between sips."
Racer 5,4.13,"Two words can describe this IPA - juicy and hoppy...

This was a huge hop-punch to my mouth - very juicy, and enough booze to pull it all together in a nice looking beer. I was also impressed with the full-bodied mouthfeel.

On the bottle it claims it helped start the on-going hop craze. After having this, I have to agree..."
Racer 5,4.19,"Reviewed from 22 oz. bomber. No visible date on bottle. This is one I used to drink a lot in the early days of exploring craft beer. It's a local staple at bars in the bay area. I always remember it being a brightly flavored IPA. Let's dive into this glass. Beautiful amber color with a rich creamy head. Beautiful lacing all over the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of pine, orange marmalade, lemon zest and candied malts. I have a feeling this isn't the freshest it could be but it seems approachable enough. The malts give off a slight bready smell. Good taste. Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first. A very well balanced moderately hopped example of a west coast IPA. In a time before double IPA's and triple IPA's this was the go to strong ale along with Mendocino brewery's Eye of the Hawk."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.62,"A very solid porter with a great aroma, flavor, and feel. Does just about everything correctly but might be too heavy even for a porter."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.8,"A bottle from 2016.

Pours out dark brown with some highlights and forms three fingers worth of light caramel colored crown that stick around well. Looks like the carbonation held up well.

The nose is brown oats, some chocolate and coffee. There is a nice, balanced roastiness that mixes well with that chocolate.

Nice chocolate in the taste. An all around balanced porter. Nothing is too overpowering and everything is working well together.

It still has carbonation holding on, which is nice. Not too thin, not too thick.

Overall, an enjoyable drink."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.48,"Lucky enough to have it straight from the tap at Tyrannena at the Beer Run post race party.
Tasty, potent and tremendously robust! Do you like coffee? Do you like beer? Look no further."

Black/brown appearance.

A rough pour yielded a small tan head; decent lace.

Dark chocolate, black coffee, mild smoke & faint cream notes in the nose.

Medium mouthfeel.

Cream & chocolate syrup flavors up front; faint raspberry notes on the finish.

The nose promised a lot, but the flavor was muted. Disappointing but not bad."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,3.36,Tastes like cloying sweet old soggy coffee grounds steeped in a porter.
The Devil Made Me Do It!,4,"Aroma is chocolate, dark malts and slightly grainy/earthy. The flavor is dark malts, mild citrus/fruit, chocolate, slight sugar sweetness and a smooth/acidic finish."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.03,Solid coffee beer. Very smooth.
The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.46,"If you like Coffee Porters this is excellent. It pours a dark rich brown, almost black, with a dense head. It smells great, and it drinks like silk! They nailed the right amount of coffee. You can definitely smell and taste the coffee, but it does not overwhelm the great porter taste either. Definitely a repeat buy."
The Devil Made Me Do It!,4.17,"Tasted in a Rastal Teku from a 12 oz bottle on January 27, 2017. If you like coffee porter, this one is nicely balanced. The coffee is there, but it doesn't overwhelm the hop or malt aromas/flavors. Highly recommended."

Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.48,"My god, this is certainly one of my favorite beers. I was never a big stout guy, until I tried this. Unbelievably rich in flavor and texture. Poured into a regular beer glass incredibly dark with a great tone."
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.33,"From the growler via Jungle Jim's Eastgate in a snifter. This solid
warming brew pours a blackish brown with cola highlights and a
very nice head of tan khaki foam that subsides to a thick ring, thin
wafting pool, and displays some nice lacing. Nose of heavy boozy
bourbon, dark cocoa, dark coffee, vanilla, and oak. Flavors flow
in line with the nose with bourbon and vanilla that are rounded
out by oak and moderate coffee and touches of cocoa with
faint char and warming astringent booze. Mouth feel is
medium, warming, moderately rich, light carbonation,
and a warming malt forward finish that is subtly
dry.

Overall, this is solid but improves VASTLY with warmth
giving it more of an appropriate RIS mouth feel.
That said, when it is cold it is a bit thin. Even
with warmth I have had BBA Dubbels that
compare in profile almost to a T. Still
it is a solid offering from a GREAT
brewery up by the LAKES.

About 5 years ago this brew changed
with more hops, then it got thinner...it needs
to be more ""chewy"" to reach that prized RIS label
like it once did. I know everything changes,
but PLEASE make this more beefy like it
USED to be...like 10 years ago beefy!


Cheers"
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.44,"Pours dark black. Aroma is mostly bourbon with hints of roasted malts. The taste is fuller and more complex than aroma. Amazing taste combining bourbon and chocolate sweetness with roasted malts and a hint of vanilla. Solid medium/fuller feel though as is my personal taste, I would like a fuller feel. Incredible stout."
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.5,2012 version sampled from 12oz. bottle at home. I very much like the low carbonation and the barrel presence is present but mild. Nice vanilla in the aroma. This has aged well.
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.62,"I tried this at the Daily Growler in Powell, Ohio. It poured an opaque dark with thin tan ring head that did not leave much lace. The scent had waifs of bourbon goodness. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with bourbon and dark chocolate presence. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with smooth carbonation. Overall it was an excellent beer."
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.37,"A-Pours a very dark color with a slight head and lacing
A-Aroma has Bourbon, chocolate and roasted malts hints
T-The taste follows the nose with a Bourbon, chocolate and roasted malt flavor
M-A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
O-A well balanced Stout"
Blackout Stout - Barrel-Aged,4.25,SAVOR DC 2018
Thumbprint Enigma,4,"Thanks to FBarber for this one, from a ninja box during NBS BIF #12. 12oz bottle (no date) poured into 6oz NG flute (also courtesy FBarber). Poured a dark brown color, with some reddish hints at the translucent edges. There was 1/4 inch of tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing.

The aroma had nice malts, good wood scents, some cherry, and a touch of yeast spice/funk.

Pretty similar on the tongue, with the funk taking the lead. The fruit was noticeable but not dominant, and the wood added a nice counterpoint.

The body was on the thinner side, smooth and had a dry finish.

Drinkability was very nice, but it's a sipper, not a quaffer.

Overall, another great brew from NG. A must-try if you see it."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.62,"really nice brown/amber body and dark off white head with nice retention. Very delicate and smooth upfront sourness followed by dark cherries, slight sweet maraccino cherries, crisp green apple, earthy breadyness, and a long oakey vanilla finish that intensifies as the beer warms. Seeiously an amazing and uncommon take on the style."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.09,2017 Vintage Black cherry with lemon caramel. Fairly dry with nice acidity. Vanilla-raspberry and bright cherry lead to salty lemon... Just shy of puckering. Touch of bitter almond late.
Thumbprint Enigma,4.02,"Pours a dark red color. The head is 1 finger, off white, frothy, with decent retention . There's nice lacing on the glass.
The nose is slightly sour, tart.
Taste - tart, fruity. Cherry, maybe tart apple. The flavor is up front for the most part, though a bit lingers to the backside.
Feel - decent body. Some carbonation feel.
Delicious well made beer of this style."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.49,"Modest finger’s worth of dark tan foam, not much density so it dissolves at a quick pace, no real lacing to speak of, just a momentary sheet if you tilt the glass. Given the relatively dark brown coloration of the liquid it displays good transparency, a bit more yellowish at the surface, a few tiny bubbles drift lazily upwards. Cleansingly sour nose of plum to prune, cherry fruit with a more general fruitcake character, coconut flakes, dark chocolate, glazed ginger, bit of a woody char, more vanilla and bubblegum accents as it warms, one likely wants to avoid serving this too chilled. Medium-bodied, has a creamier underbelly of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and coconut custard. However, it has so much acidic zing that you feel it rush through the mouth. The carbonation is mild but not all that needed for the beer to feel crisp. The cherries dominate but nuances of raspberry, golden raisin and apple appear in support. Cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger play bit roles. Finishes with some earthy funk and cider vinegar. Extremely long finish, can’t wash it out of your mouth. Great complexity, harmony and drinkability."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.09,"Aged for one year.

Look: dark, mostly opaque brown. minimal tan head
Smell: Sweet fruitiness immediately apparent on pouring. Smell is interesting—tart fruit, bubble gum, faint spice
Taste: The tart fruit is front and center, but not overpowering. Cherry, green apple, raspberry.
Feel: Medium to heavy body, moderate carbonation, slightly astringent

Overall: Surprising and well done sour-like flavor profile."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.34,"A - Dark brown body, with red highlights, a wispy light tan head, and minor line lacing.

S - The nose is all about acid and funk, lines of oak and earth, highlights of fruit.

T - Strong hit of acidity, bright and sour, a bit of lactic yogurt, and a strong core of berry-like pucker. Sour raspberries and a definite cherry hit.

M - Brisk as hell, with strong tart pucker, a bit of slickness, and a prickly close.

O - Very well done. Delicious and bright. Punchy and forward. Satisfying."
Thumbprint Enigma,4.21,"Brewery only release 2017.

Dark mocha java brown with a creamy beige head of 2 fingers. Hilly lace left behind.

Aroma of sour crushed candies, the kind that tighten up your forehead and make your mouth drip. Some very slight chocolate/roast malts behind that.

Flavor is very fruity, and implements both bright and dark sides of the coin. It actually comes off like a sour Belgian dark ale. Very cool. It's got notes of banana, persimmon, dark cherry, lemon, salt, plum, apple, apple cider vinegar, and then some suggestions of chocolate, spice, cinnamon, and then coffee on the very tail end. It's like last year's Oud Bruin, but fruitier overall, much less complex, and more focused.

Feel is puckering, creamy, and soft. Very nice feel here.

Overall, I might like Oud Bruin just a touch better, but this is no slouch by any means. A fantastic dark brown ale that I'm glad I could pick up at the brewery (even if it was $5 a bottle)."
DirtWolf,4.75,One of my favorites! Yummy!
DirtWolf,4.02,"Golden, foggy body. Lacy head. Smell is pine, pineapple, moderately sweet, slightly floral and lemony. Taste is tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, dank pine, more floral notes, honey, and lemon. Pretty nice balance between the pine and the tropical sweetness, with a nice malty finish. The bottle has a BB date of feb 4, so maybe it’s not as crisp as a fresh one. Still, really a good beer."
DirtWolf,4.34,"Appearance: Crystal clear amber-gold, large white head, good lacing.
Aroma: Pilsner malt underpinning supports the fruity, resinous hops that follow.
Taste: Flip flops the order noted in the aroma. Hops more dominant, flush with pine and tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel: Finishes with enough maltiness to keep things interesting and refreshing while still hop-centric.
Overall: Lingering and lasting, well carbonated, full bodied."
DirtWolf,4.02,Great imperial IPA
DirtWolf,4.43,"Rich orange color, decent head, strongly alcoholic, sweet malt base and - most importantly to me - an earthy, piney rush of flavor that balances out and eventually overwhelms the citrus and floral tastes that I find so unappealing in all but the very best IPAs.
I understand why many who appreciate the hazy and flowery side of aledom don't like it much, but it's just up my alley and is my go-to on weekend afternoons when I have no responsibilities."
DirtWolf,4.12,Bottle pour - deep golden honey color with thick white head leaving significant foamy/frosty lacing. Nose is earthy and floral with hints of citrus and pine. Taste follows with a malty backbone and lingering bitterness on a dryish finish.
DirtWolf,3.61,"Another boring beer masquerading as an IPA. Flavorful, but not with hops. Not bitter, smooth, but ultimately unsatisfying and difficult to identify its ingredients. I don't get the hype."
DirtWolf,3.54,"I've had this one several times over the years and enjoy the first few sips, but eventually feel like it's all bitter hops without much else going for it. Maybe just not my style of beer."
DirtWolf,3.84,"Color clear amber
Scent piney and grapefruit orange
Tastes a good mixture of bitterness and fruit. Don’t see this as world class but more as excellent. I like Doubles that have more fruit forward than this. One of my favorites is golden monkey"
DirtWolf,3.71,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.7%. Golden colour, slightly hazy. Moderate white head. Hoppy aroma, notes of pine and spruce, hints of citrus and caramel. Distinctly hoppy flavour, piney and resinous notes, also grapefruit. Very bitter finish, but also very moreish and drinkable for its strength."
DirtWolf,4.62,Hoppy tones and smooth Carmel aftertaste that lingers on tongue. Fantastic
DirtWolf,4.67,"L: pale straw yellow. Very bright and inviting
S: very herbal with a nice pine presence.
T: perfectly executed. Pine and citrus, with an earthy background. Phenomenal.
F: medium body. Pretty light
O: I don’t know what category this DIPA would fall in but it is in a class by itself. Most unique and unmistakable taste you will find"
DirtWolf,4.01,"Th beer is a pale straw color but with a decent white head. It is clear. On the nose, rose notes and bitter herbal notes are present. Maybe its the label art, but it smells like a pine forest. On the palate , it is nice a bitter. the same hops notes from before are present but with citrus as well. The malt is there an similar to white beard with some whole wheat flour mixed in. The hops dominate the taste though expect for the finish but before the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is foamy but the body isn't great. The bubbles aren't pointed. Overall, a good well hoped IPA."
DirtWolf,4.75,"On tap at CityWorks. Tremendous lacing like a solid wall.clear, low carbonation, not a heavy alcohol tang."
DirtWolf,4.6,"It smells bright and hoppy with a bit more of an alcohol taste than your average IPA.

The taste is a little sweet up front with a little maltiness but it soon gives way to a strong hoppy grapefruit with subtle notes of orange, orange zest, orange spritz or orange oil, lemon, lemon juice, lemonade, pithy lemon rind, lemon peel, lemon zest, lemon oil, tangerine, citrus, tropical fruit including but not limited to pineapple, mango, star anise, kumquat, not coconut but guava, passion fruit, jackfruit, pomegranate, cherimoya, rambutan, persimmon, a lot of apples, I'm no apple expert but the kind of apples they use for pies also golden delicious, red delicious, granny Smith, pink lady, fuji, honeycrisp and other apples, apple peel, peaches, nectarine, kiwi, banana chips, crab apples which although aren't edible but you can taste them and spit them out, elements of graphite, barbed wire, quick drying cement, pine but not just any pine, Douglas fir, red pine, longleaf pine, Virginia pine, pine tar, pitch, sap, and possibly hops.

The mouthfeel is light with a lot of fizz. It finishes clean and bitter and follows the nose?

In all seriousness overall this is an exceptional IPA. Besides the smell the alcohol doesn't really come through. I give it a solid 5.5 out of 6."
DirtWolf,4.27,"Excellent clarity in a yellow-orange beer showcasing active carbonation that feeds a 2 finger pillowy stark white head. Layers of lace cling to the glass with each sip. Juicy pine, grapefruit, and resin highlight a well rounded aroma profile. Bold but not too aggressive, almost a savory hop profile. It's juicy up front, grapefruit and resinous in the middle and then it finishes with a zesty pine. There is a an aggressiveness to the finish and a lingering boldly hoppy aftertaste. The body stays on the lighter side, somehow making for an almost refreshing sip and making this as dangerously drinkable as it is sipable. Really good selection from Victory here."
DirtWolf,4.92,"Dank Dank Dank. Piney and very hoppy but it defines the term dank, and in a good way. Drink this one by itself. No food pairings just sip, swish, savor and swallow. After you appreciate all that then open another to wash down your Beef, Ribs , Mexican etc. It will stand up to them all. But you owe it to yourself to enjoy that first one by itself.
Best DIPA that is easy to find."
DirtWolf,4.16,"Clear, bright golden coloring, lush white, long-lasting head. Lookin' fine. That ain't no lie.

Aroma: honey-sweet, tropical fruit bitter. Citra? Mosaic? Another hot hop I haven't thought of? Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.

Taste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn't felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…

Dirt Wolf isn't a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell's HopSlam. It's a good formula that's proven popular. And easy to market: ""Can't find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam's too expensive? Try this, it's just as good!"" I almost wrote ""almost"", but, really, it's just as good.

Not a tongue-ripper, not a palate-destroyer, just a nice, hoppy pleaser, with an onset of alcohol. mmm, hmm."
DirtWolf,4.2,"I'm a local and it is my ""go-to "" IPA. Good citrus, nice smell of grapefruit, and a bit of pine but what I really like is the smooth mouthfeel. The 8.7% alcohol content is accurate and makes me feel ""comfortable"" after a glass but helps with the enjoyable experience. It is an excellent Imperial IPA."
Zonker Stout,4.24,"cant believe i have not rated this one until now, one of their classics and one of the best straight up stouts in the region, absolutely famous for a reason, no frills, old school extraordinarily well crafted, somehow still flies under the radar. black and shiny and frothy from the tap, looks gorgeously refined and silky, good body but not overly viscous for what it is. the nose is earthy and dry, no attempt at too much middle malt richness, dark chocolate, an almost irish thing to the yeast, some toasted breadiness, fresh ground coffee, and minerals, just a little alcohol, more at temperature, maybe oats or dark wheat in the mash here too, more nuance than most on the grain side without any real sweetness. the flavor has some charcoal character, an almost oak aged decadence and smoothness, but is yet still dry. more coffee, dark chocolate, light raisin, and mocha character, along with a silky texture than hangs around just long enough on the swallow and isnt quite neutral on the ferment, right on. subtle almost rye spice to this too, just a little more going on than in most of these, but all real subtle. they really dont make beer like this anymore, nowadays this would have vanilla and milk sugar in it, be 9% abv, and be bastardized beyond recognition. credit to snake river for a world class beer and for not feeling the need to make it trendy. if you built it they will come. it doesnt get much better than this in the style. i would love to try the nitro edition..."

Zonker Stout,4.3,"12oz can stamped 03/02/21 poured into a tulip pint glass at fridge temp 6% ABV. The beer pours dense, black in color with generous and lasting mocha colored head. The head recedes slowly to a one inch cap and leaves a web of lacing covering the glass. The aroma is mild featuring dark cocoa & slight ash with a nutty, earthy undertone. The taste is more dark chocolate with a caramel balance not found in the aroma. Mild bitterness. The mouthfeel is silky & medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent. This is a superb example of a disappearing style. Export stouts, done well, offer the character of the imperials with much better drinkability. Would definitely acquire and drink again."
Zonker Stout,4.02,"CAN: 12 fl oz pull-tab with an understated label. Nabbed as part of a sixer from a Total Wine & More in Colorado - I think for $9.99 USD plus tax?

""Export Style Stout."" Currently ranked #1 on the top Stout - Foreign / Export list with a 93 overall score.

6% ABV.

Served cold into an oversized pint nonic snifter hybrid glass thingamajigger (I don't know what to call this glassware but it's fancy).

APPEARANCE: Pours a gorgeous gilded tan head replete with loads of creamy softness. Robust...its starting ~6-7cm head height sticks around for a good 8 minutes or so, and rich thick lacing coats the sides of the glass as the head slowly recedes. Body colour is a true to style opaque black. No yeast/lees are visible within.

Looks as an export stout ought to. I guess the head could be still more gilded and could have more of an imperial stout-like golden sheen to better effect, if we're really picking nits. I see nothing wrong with this appearance and it looks rather good.

AROMA: Roasted barley is immediately obvious, buoyed by chocolate malt, dark malt sweetness, and burnt sugars. Hints of something from the licorice/fennel/aniseed family of herbs...I guess fennel. Burnt blackstrap molasses. Buried scintillae of caramelized sugars.

Seems perfectly attenuated for the style, with a big roasty bitterness balanced by specialty chocolate malts. Seems like a carafa-driven export stout that's impeccably balanced judging by the aroma.

I don't get any coffee-like aromatics, dark fruit, vanilla/vanillin, or actual chocolate (i.e. the chocolate aroma is solely chocolate malt-derived).

Aromatic intensity is average.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Big, roasty, and dry, with a nice undertone of burnt sugars and earthy fennel-like spice. No hop flavours are obvious...maybe some preservative-only herbal hop varietals. Chocolate malt joins with its dark malt backbone to give it some balancing sweetness without usurping the roast at the beer's heart. And the roast is lovely...this beer is chock full of carafa goodness, pleasing the roasted barley lover in all of us.

Has a subtle dryness and coarseness that helps coax out depth of flavour from the carafa/roasted barley without detracting from the gooeyness on the back end that complements the smooth chocolate flavours. Rich without tasting too sweet; robust without being too boozy or harsh. A flirtation with silky softness towards the back end helps surface a brief hint of fudge and chocolate syrup before the roast banishes that sweetness back under its depths.

Carbonation is perfect. Medium to full-bodied, which is apt for the style and this beer's flavour profile.

OVERALL: This is an impeccably balanced export stout with no flaws and few shortcomings...I will say the subtle coffee-like flavour carafa tends to impart is absent here to its slight detriment, and I can't help but imagine some vanillin or vanilla bean flavours would liven it up. But while I can imagine it better with subtle tweaks, I can't find any faults or flaws; it's tremendously well brewed.

Rivals Guinness' export stouts, which is no small feat in my book.

A- (4.13) / EXCELLENT

Zonker Stout,4.96,"Today marks my first day off in a week, following six (6) ten & a-half (10.5)-hour days! I just started a job as a sorter in the post office & we are busy, busy, busy. I am tired, tired, tired, but getting used to the pace, the hours & the pay! 8=) The start of today will be Stout Sunday before switching to something else. For me, too many Stouts are as binding as cheese for some people. 8=p

From the CAN: ""WY drink anything else? [Ha!]""; ""GABF Gold Medal""; ""Zonker Export Style Stout""; ""World Beer Cup Gold""; ""Named for a highly effective fishing fly, Zonker is a rich, well-balanced foreign-style stout formulated with a huge amount of roasted barley as well as chocolate, black, and caramel malts.

Oooh. I wish that I had transcribed the preceding before my Crack! of the vent, followed by an inverted Glug. I wanted a pseudo-cascade, which I got, but I should have treated it like the bloody Stanley Cup & worn white gloves & treated it reverentially, instead of as a cheap tart. It may be some residual bitterness over Linda Lou, a Wyomingite, who threw me over a quarter-century ago, eh? It performed admirably, forming two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with very good retention. Color was coal Black/Opaque (SRM = 44) & as to light penetration? It sent out a bouncer to keep watch! 8=O Nose was beautiful - charcoal smoke; anise; treacle; toffee; coffee; dried dark fruits, such as raisins & prunes; burnt tobacco - think a smoked Maduro cigar. Mmm.

I used to love Macanudo Maduros until I developed adult-onset asthma. Mmm, they were slow-burning & more flavorful than so many others. Try one, if you CAN.

Mouthfeel was dense & thick, more like a R-hook into the tongue. POW! 8=O The taste was like a cut 'n' paste of this site's Style Guide - "" a very pronounced roasted character"", ""roasted grain and malt flavor with a coffee, chocolate, or lightly burnt grain character, although without a sharp bite"". 8=O Holy Picture Perfect, Batman! No wonder all of the awards. Finish was ""[m]oderately dry"" & I was left wondering how I have not had this before. This was an outstanding Foreign Stout!

I am heavy on all-5s, despite the site's dictum to have them be a rarity. Fair dinkum. I didn't like the bouncer's glare & the feckin tongue punch put me off. Howzat? YMMV."
Zonker Stout,3.94,"Aroma is coffee, dark/roasted malts and slightly burnt. The flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, a hint dark fruit and a slightly acidic/somewhat smooth finish."
Zonker Stout,4.25,"L - Fantastic foam, head, and some minor lacing on this ""between dry Irish and export Stout"" stout.
S - Roast, chocolate, burnt grains, smells like an Irish breakfast on a foggy morning.
T - Where it truly stands out against other light stouts - it tastes like something, none of that dry, chalky foamy dry Irish effect, and ALMOST as rich as a bigger export stout (Guinness/Cumbre's Malpais). A great 'tweener Stout for the undecided.
F - Great carbonation, enough hops to not be dull or too malty, just great palate impression. Full taste and fizz.
O - One of THE best American Stouts on the market today, period. End of discussion. Get it, try it, trade for it. Good stuff!"
Zonker Stout,4.23,"Inky black body topped with a thick, rocky and sticky light tan head; sheets and rings of foam cling to the glass. Excellent roasted grain aroma; baker's chocolate. Nice rich chocolatey flavor; cocoa; well-rounded bitterness; not too sweet. Heavy, oily body; smooth and slick; great residual sugar heft.

This a a delicious, straightforward stout, nothing pretentious or gimmicky. Beautiful eye appeal and outstanding mouthfeel with a deep and balanced taste."
Zonker Stout,4.1,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown, nearly black color with a one finger head of tan foam. The head fades very fast, leaving a little bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is massive of a roasted coffee bean smell mixed with cocoa and a touch of molasses. Along with these smells come a tiny bit of charred toast and a hint of vanilla crème.
Taste – The taste begins with a rather strong dark roasted malt flavor mixed with a god showing of a coffee flavor. Upfront there is also a light chocolate taste, with the chocolate adding a touch of sweetness along with a caramel taste. As the taste advances the chocolate becomes drier in nature and takes on a more baking chocolate like flavor. All the while the caramel fades some as well being replaced by some light char tastes. With the transitions of flavors that occur during the taste profile, one is left with a rather dark roasty coffee flavor to liner on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is one the average to slightly thicker side with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly lower. For the dark coffee flavors of the brew the feel is well done and makes of a nice medium for the dark roasty tastes to be well appreciated.
Overall – Dark, coffee, and somewhat on the drier side. A rather nice foreign stout."
Zonker Stout,4.62,"12 oz can poured into Tallgrass globe snifter.

My first Snake River beer experience.

Deep, luscious, dark liquid spews forth forming a mirror-finish body and a tall creamy beige cap of 2 fingers. Sparse broken lacing up the sides remains as the head diminishes to 1/2 finger.

Aroma is of deeply dark roasted malts, piney hop, ashtray, espresso, and some faint semi-sweet chocolate.

Flavor brings deep, dark roasted flavors, intensely bitter and very burnt. Yet there's a nice molasses-meets-chocolate sweetness that balances the ashen assault to a palatable and tasty level. Slight grassy espresso. The flavor mirrors the Russian Imperial Stout style with a little extra ash.

Feel is carbonated foremost, and then slick/oily, and then roasty/dry. Pretty killer stuff.

Overall, best in its class. For an Export Stout without any barrel or adjuncts this beer is simply incredible. It reminds me of bells expedition at half the ABV. For the style, it's a 5 all day long. Best stout I've found on shelves under 10% ABV. Absolutely does not get better than this in its class. To the point where if I'm on the west side of the Dakotas, I will make the trip into Wyoming just to buy this beer. Incredible recipe, incredible execution, artisan brewing. Nice work guys."
Zonker Stout,4.31,"Had this on 2019-10-06 near Pittsburgh, PA from a 12oz canned on 2019-07-31

A - Opaque dark brown with a 2-finger light brown head and great lace

S - Chocolate espresso latte. Medium roasted grain. Sweet and inviting

T - Dark chocolate, roasted grain with some char, earthy spice, lactose. Balancing, roasted bitterness.

M - Medium body and light carbonation. Creamy at first but finishes dry with some acerbic/acid bite.

O - Tons of flavor packed into this 6% brew. Quite impressive and an exemplary example of an Export Stout. I can see why it won quite a few medals at GABF over the years"
Zonker Stout,4.25,"A great stout that I can only compare to Fremont - Dark Star, Eight & Sand - Short & Stout, and Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel - Péché Mortel, the tops of the non-barrel aged stouts!"
Zonker Stout,4.18,"The roasty nose brings to mind coffee and thick stout. In the mouth, a tingle from the carbonation accompanies notes of chocolate and dark malts. Swallowing it, a mild hop build gives it adaquate bitter to keep you coming back. Overall, a fantastically interesting, savory stout."
Zonker Stout,5,The best Foreign Stout by the best small craft brewery in the USA!
Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.46,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.35,"Growler filled 10 days ago in Portland and arrived in MA.
Not filled super high on the neck, but carb was super solid.
Really great Old Money beer. Super solid TIPA from back in the day. No haze at all, super clear. Super tasty. Seek it out!"
Notorious Triple IPA,4.38,On tap at Edison City ale house.
Notorious Triple IPA,4.11,"Wow. Usually double IPAs are too strong for me. This is a triple IPA. And yet it is delicious! It is incredibly strong, but you have to expect that. It's like drinking port, if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent IPA."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.79,"Old school big IPA. Doesn’t fall into the trappings of being a syrupy mess because of the high abv. Dry, bitter, resinous, scary easy to drink. Well crafted. I had very few TIPAs that I like, love this one."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.22,"2020-10-02
32oz growler served in a SIP Fest 2020 snulip. Bought it yesterday at Thirsty Hop. I've had this several times before, but the first time in a situation where I could sit down and pay attention and write my thoughts.

Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.

Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.

Mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly dry. Overall...this is really good. Dangerously easy to drink. I knew it was really good. It's nice to pay attention to it. I consider this a prime example of west coast style TIPA."
Notorious Triple IPA,3.81,"I think the travel may have effected this one. May not be a fair rating, but it’s what I got."
Notorious Triple IPA,4.4,"Clear deep gold with a touch of red. One finger of dense cream color head that forms rings of lace as the level drops.
Smell is orange green dank and rich malt.
Taste is bold floral and fruity hops with a bit of dankness. Good strong bready malt support.
Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The finish is mildly dry and somewhat bitter.
Overall a tasty triple ipa."
Bourbon Paradise,4.45,"Look - Fantastic looking BA Stout! Black and thick with a really nice thick tan head and fantastic rimming and lacing. Not sure what you can do better
Smell - nutty dark chocolate woody smell. I'm sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but I don't get the coconut, more just nut. maybe some molasses caramel deep in there
Taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla.
Feel - Medium full body with a medium light carb, slight creaminess
Overall - I like how the vanilla and coconut aren't overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways. The Barrel to this beer is fantastic. Well done not overly sweet BA Stout"
Bourbon Paradise,4.56,"Awesome.
Pricy? Sure.
But worth every sip.
The art of the craft.,.
Stuck 2 in the cave for Xmas.,."
Bourbon Paradise,4.7,"Fantastic! Before getting into the flavor, I greatly appreciate this brew being offered in 12 oz bottles. Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile. I liken it to Phil Anselmo holding back in Cemetery Gates, unleashing at just the right time. It goes without saying, but drink this one slowly, as the flavor profile changes as it warms. Enjoy the ride."
Bourbon Paradise,4.68,"Appearance - The beer poured thick blackness with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - Dark chocolate was most prominent in the nose. Coconut was faint in the nose.

Taste - Initially, the dark chocolate led the way. It was like a bourbon barrel aged Mounds bar. The chocolate and coconut worked so well together. The sweetness of the coconut was most prominent in back. The bourbon made for a warming finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick with roasted chocolate. Carbonation was largely non-existent.

Overall - This was a great coconut stout."
Bourbon Paradise,4.14,"Packaged on 11/20/2020 - consumed on 3/13/2022. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip.

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention.

Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose.

Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.

Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.

More on the dessert end of the spectrum for the style, but very potent with some balanced barrel influence. Enjoyed it more than my notes might suggest."
Bourbon Paradise,4.52,"Little to no head. Only a very thin tan ring clinging to the glass. Very dark like dark chocolate cake. The nose is chocolate and more chocolate. Bourbon comes right out of the middle of the chocolate. Vanilla and barrel leak out at the end. The taste has bourbon, vanilla, and oak jumping right out. Chocolate and a small hint of coconut follow. There is a small bit of spice that hides behind the coconut at the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but with the right amount of carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It wants to be too sweet but stops just short and balances out to make you smile. (Found old notes on this one)"
Bourbon Paradise,4.13,"2019 version enjoyed 27 months later.

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.

Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.

Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.

Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.

I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at."
Bourbon Paradise,5,"Wonderful brew. So far, my favorite."
Bourbon Paradise,4.13,"Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut. Real easy to drink for a slow sipper and there is a good amount of chocolate throughout the beer that balances well with the vanilla and coconut."
Bourbon Paradise,4,"BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut...

Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though..."
Bourbon Paradise,3.69,"$12.99 per 12 oz. 13.7% ABV. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip.

Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5

A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25

S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0

T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors. No spiciness to balance, just the ABV. 3.5

MF – Heavy bodied, sweet with a spirited finish, but not hot. 3.75"
Bourbon Paradise,4.5,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Fits the style perfectly, IMHO. The nose is led by the bourbon, but it’s surprisingly not too hot, and there’s a really nice vanilla note to accompany the dark chocolate and char notes, and there’s maybe a smidge of coconut.

Dark chocolate leads the taste, accompanied by the bourbon, and balanced by the vanilla and a more substantial coconut flavor. This is hefty and brawny, yet also well balanced, something that requires a lot of skill from the brewery in my experience. Prairie definitely has that skill set.

The mouthfeel is rich and slightly creamy, well suited to the beer. I really liked the base beer - a LOT - and this is better, IMHO. World class stuff here."

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now

Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind

This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars

I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!"
Fou' Foune,4.5,Excellent beer. Nice mix of funk and apricot both on the nose and palate.

Indian Brown Ale,4,"First time I had ever seen this style...Really good! No joke, I could taste a stout, an IPA (not a lot but some distinctive hops) and a good brown ale. Mostly the first and last but it wasn't entirely one if the aforementioned styles. I really enjoyed it"
Indian Brown Ale,3.99,"Pours copper with a 1/2 inch creamy, tan head. Thick lacing, both lasting right to the end. Heavy carbonation.

Aroma is nutty, malty, slight brown sugar.

Tastes of nuts, brown sugar, roast malts, caramel malts, and coffee. Moderate bitterness.

Full bodied, creamy, fizzy mouthfeel.

A nice brown IPA. Great color and carbonation."
Indian Brown Ale,3.97,"Very dark brown, translucent, not hazy at all, frothy light tan head, good retention, lacy; The aroma is slightly tangy with a hint of sweetness; Rich full bodied smooth flavor, slightly sweet; Mouthfeel is very smooth, almost thick, moderately carbonated; Tasty, pleasant, a good beer off the beaten path.

The label says Indian Brown Dark IPA, but it really doesn't taste like an IPA."
Indian Brown Ale,3.38,"Appearance: Very very dark brown, but ruby red up to the light. Off-white to cola head with a bit of spotted lacing and average retention.

Nose: Nutty, coffee and toffee. Lightly roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and some chocolate at the end.

Taste: Creamy but a little bit dry upfront. Not as malty as I assumed it would be. It is slightly dry and a bit like sucking on a lightly toasted coffee bean. Astringent throughout. I get an unpleasant bitterness from the hops. So much so that I switched glasses halfway through to make sure it wasn't my glass. My eyes and my nose wanted this to taste a certain way, but my mouth said otherwise. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad watery.

Notes: I was excited for this one as Dogfish usually hits it out of the park (in my opinion). I think the hops being added to what should be a bit maltier brew throws this one off. It's a great idea, but doesn't know what it wants to be."
Indian Brown Ale,4.25,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pours a lovely mahogany/ruby-brown color with a finger-thick tan head with decent retention and lacing. Glows faintly when held to the light.

Nutty notes are upfront in the aroma, along with coffee, toffee, molasses, caramel, hazelnuts, barley, roasted grains, brown sugar, toast, and chocolate. Complex dark aromas and sweet notes.

Dark cocoa, roasted nuts, barley, pine, and brown sugar are upfront on the palette. The rest of the notes follow. Medium-light body feel."
Indian Brown Ale,4.41,Great beer. Nothing to complain about.
Indian Brown Ale,4.25,"Brown hue.

Off-white head; frothy lace.

Nice coffee nose.

Creamy medium mouthfeel.

Creamy coffee & hazelnut flavor.

A delicious, flavorful brown ale."
Indian Brown Ale,4.03,"A hybrid of 2 of my favorite beers (IPA and Brown Ale) Also has a scotch ale in there as well, so I had to give it a try . I've heard amazing things about it. Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.3,"Bless my friends at Tavour for delivering this to my door (eventually). Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife.

Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts.

Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo.

Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.65,"Thick and viscous like oil; impenetrable black body; no head but a bit of percolating carbonation; flat; sediment flecks tread along the top of the beer. Rich aroma; dark chocolate and roasted coffee; coconut. Enormous flavors of milk chocolate, fudge; coconut and bourbon; faint maraschino cherry and peppermint suggestion; subliminal earthy spiciness in the background. Dense, sludgy mouthfeel; heavy slipperiness; incredible residual sugar presence; syrupy; low-level alcohol warmth in the background.

What hath these brewer's created? Sure, a rather dark and dull appearance but the smell characteristics pick things up. Then, you come to the taste and mouthfeel. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! What an awe-inspiring experience. The depth, richness and complexity are nearly out of this world. A beer one needs to experience to fully appreciate what mere words struggle to convey.

Pouring temperature: 61.7% ℉; bottling data: 2022 release"
Medianoche - Coconut,4.56,"2022 version poured from a 500ML bottle into a snifter. Pours very dark resembling motor oil. Very thick, which I enjoy. Solid coconut flavor that isn't over the top sweet but drinking more than a 500ml bottle would be a challenge."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.51,"500ml bottle from Tavour. Slow, thick pour, black as midnight, no head at all.
Aroma features light boozy notes, chocolate and heaps of coconut. Taste is sweet, chocolate and coconut, thick and syrupy. Luscious, sumptuous."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.9,"#128, yummy!"
Medianoche - Coconut,4.11,"No vintage or ABV info on the bottle, but this is the aged Blanton's barrels for 21-24 months version. This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface.

This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.

Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.98,"2021 version aged in Blanton’s. Crazy thickness just sticks to the glass. Anchorage Blessed thick. Shiny film on top let’s you know there’s a bunch of fresh coconut. Nose is heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, coconut. First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour.

Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.82,"This is a special beer.

Pours deep, deep black and very oily thick with absolutely no carbonation and no head whatsoever. At the end of my pour, a thin sheen of copper colored beer glistened on the top. The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut. The taste is rich, deeply, deeply chocolate with cinnamon, vanilla notes and coconut as well. There is a strong resemblence to brownies laced with alcohol as well as to a rich creme brulee. A noteworthy taste extravaganza."
Medianoche - Coconut,4.4,"The coffee-coconut was one of my beers of the year last year, from that point onward wanted to try this one. Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap. Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon. Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one. This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building. Still a great stout, but the sweetness does add up over time, share the bottle"
Medianoche - Coconut,4.57,"Look - black thick syrup with fantastic lacing, no real head or rimming though
Smell - sweet coconut chocolate and booze
Taste - chocolate coconut vanilla and lots of Barrel
Feel - very thick creamy very light carb
Overall - rally fantastic until you get a slug. Had 3 slugs and that was not pleasant"
Medianoche - Coconut,4.66,"2022 bottle. Pours mega thick. Completely opaque. Cannot see through it at all. Very minimal mocha head. Aroma is milk chocolate and subtle coconut. Flavor is same as aroma…huge milk chocolate and more coconut in the finish. Sweet but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is insane. This coats everything. Mouth and glass coating. Insanely thick. Overall, a treat to drink. Was a bit much to solo the bottle. Better to share."
Black Tuesday,4.59,"From the 750 ml bottle in a snifter via Bluejacket74! Many thanks for this beast!
This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown
foam that settles to a thick ring that dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing....but
give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted
goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes.
Flavors nail it! Dark bakers chocolate in bathed in rich bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich
char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread.
Excellent mouth feel for such a beast-----smooth, rich, coating, full body, light
carbonation with subtle lift, and a warming, bourbon forward, bitter roasted
malt finish that is medium dry.

Overall-----phew! What a brew!

Cheers"
Black Tuesday,4.72,"2013 in 2022. 8 plus years and zero signs of oxidation. Very dark brown. Nose has light cinnamon behind big bourbon. Super boozy, notes of chocolate and molasses. Big body and medium carbonation with tongue numbing alcohol. Dream ale."
Black Tuesday,4.96,"Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!
Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.
The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)
The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.
The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.
OA, Wow, really tasty."
Black Tuesday,4.59,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong. Some more age wouldn't hurt this brew at all. I thought this was a pretty good imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you're into big barrel aged imperial stouts!"
Black Tuesday,4.55,"Bottle received in Bif13 from @colts9016

Brewers Notes: Our infamous Black Tuesday is an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels for over a year. Rich caramel, toasted malt, vanilla, burnt wood and anise are just a few of the many flavors in this rich, decadent imperial stout.

2020: 19.3% ABV

Chilled bottle rested in my beer fridge for a special event. Thanksgiving table is set , let’s get after it

Poured into a Spiegelau stout glass , one finger brown foam cap , quickly recedes to a ring over a dark cola red brown liquid

Aroma is bourbon, tobacco, leather , char, roasted malts

Good beer , thanks Jammin!!"
Black Tuesday,4.7,"Pours close to jet black, small cap of tan head that settles to a thin ring; streaks of ruby when held up to light. Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation."

Black Tuesday,4.92,"#48 in search of Top 250. 2018 iteration, yummy without being overbearing"
Black Tuesday,5,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!"
Black Tuesday,4.24,This one is THICCC! Very dark and a strong boozy smell. Initial punch of booze and toffee up front and finishes nicely. This is a big one so definitely not on to tackle on your own!
Black Tuesday,4.72,Completely unreal thick. Had a 2016 cellared for 4 years. Chocolate and bourbon and a boozy but smooth element. Torquey at almost 20%. All the elements of a world class stout with chocolate and vanilla and tobacco. A dessert
Black Tuesday,4.55,"I tried 2017 and 2020 versions of this beer. Both pretty amazing beers, this rating is for the 2020 version which I thought was a bit more crisp and diverse in it's taste."

XTRA DUBL Benthic,5,"This was the best of the variance for 2021. While it was very sweet, it wasn’t overwhelming and you definitely could discern all of the adjuncts while getting plenty of paste out and barrel. Amazing beer"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.42,"Pours jet black, with a delayed yet aggressive dark tan head. Shockingly dense and abiding for having so much coconut.

Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.

Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer."
XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.59,"16 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 10/13/20, had 3/20/21.

Pours near black and opaque, thick looking, with a half inch foamy head and light, foamy cling. Aromas of coconut, coffee, bourbon, malt, chocolate. All distinct and vibrant. The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated.

This is one fine beer. Strong and flavorful coconut, with the barrels and coffee right behind in flavor and impact. Just delicious. Extremely enjoyable."
XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.13,"16oz can, dated 10.13.2020, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and opaque with a thin khaki head, loose bubbles and no retention nor lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich chocolate, charred oak, bourbon spirit, hot and a little bit of fusel alcohol comes through, vanilla, coconut, rich coffee and stone fruits. The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.

Verdict: A nice Benthic variant, but definitely the booziest Benthic I've come across. The balance starts off well but suffers a bit from the heat of this beer and the coffee is the element that fails to come across the most."
XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.65,"This beer is rich! Rich, creamy with a lot of coconut on the nose and in it's taste. Coffee is relatively predominant but not over powering. Excellent stout. Perhaps the best of the variants from 2020."
XTRA DUBL Benthic,5,"Easily the 2020 beer of the year for me. My new standard for BA coconut stouts. HA made hefty promises in their description of this beer, and did they ever deliver!"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,4.99,"Absolutely wonderful. The coconut is certainly the aromatic on the nose; while at taste it’s highlighted as the main flavor and perfect, velvety thick chocolate body is balanced well by the fantastic Dark Matter coffee."
Serpent's Stout,4,"You breathe, I breathe - there is no god that has a grander breath. We exist as humans - as humans… Living just to live - but I also hope living for some greater good. Not me vs you. And not you vs me. Just people. As people. And hell…can’t we just be?"
Serpent's Stout,4.36,"Fantastic stout. Heavy roasted malts is the predominant flavor, with just enough chocolate to round it out. Maybe a hint of coffee and cola. If you are looking for a stout on the toasty, charred spectrum, this is fantastic."
Serpent's Stout,4.44,"a: silky, dark jet black color. no light penetrates. thin tan head that is no more than a film (as you'd expect from the abv)

s: loads of rich roasted malts. milk and dark chocolate. sweet licorice, molasses, toffee. a hint of vanilla and oak. earthy leather and a hint of cola. a nice mild touch of dark fruit and fig sweetness at the end. rich, decadent, and complex aroma

t: roasted malts, sweet cola, and dark chocolate. a mild hop bitterness asserts itself after that, as well as a little bit of bitterness from the roast. milk chocolate and cocoa powder follow that. molasses and faint dark fruits. leather and a little tobacco hiding out in here too.

m: full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation

o: absolutely awesome Imperial Stout. rich, complex, yet very easy to drink for 11%. this beer is an absolute treat for sure"
Serpent's Stout,4.51,"Completely black body with hazelnut colored foam with an irregular but creamy grain and good persistence. Elegant bouquet of dark fruit and caramel, leather, toasted wheat and coffee, chocolate and hints of vanilla and wood. Sweet entry, caramel, chocolate, plum, raisins, great roasting notes and an earthy hopping finish. Medium body and not too viscous, fine and medium intensity carbonation. Aftertaste of ash, licorice and coffee with a return of chocolate with a gentle ethyl embrace."
Serpent's Stout,4.25,"First non-barrel aged stout I've had in a while that I really enjoyed. Pours black with thin white-cream head that lingers. Roasted malts forward on the nose. Nice dark chocolate and roasted malt notes on the palate. Coffee less apparent to me on the nose and palate than noted in some other reviews, but I drink strong coffee and like beers with strong coffee flavors, which may make me less sensitive to more subtle coffee nose and flavor. Smooth mouth feel with medium length. Very enjoyable beer."
Serpent's Stout,3.91,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Bottle was purchased online in 2012. Somehow cellared until consumption on 1/13/18. Poured from the 750 mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Very dark brown, nearly opaque, with only a minimum of visible carbonation and only small/thin head. Not much cork pop either while opening this one.

S: Nice roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a fair amount of bitter cacao. Mild coffee, caramel, tobacco. Noticeable ethanol sweetness on the nose, and some vanilla comes up as it warms.

T: Big roasted malts - dark chocolate roast and milder coffee. Caramel, vanilla, and drying tobacco. Mild cola, and a notable amount of roasted bitterness here too. More chocolate with dry bitterness in the hang.

M: The body is on the thin side for an Imperial Stout, especially one with this hefty of an ABV. Very low carbonation sensation here, but I’m willing to accept that that might be due to age. The alcohol is prominent, but not overly hot for 11%.

O: A pretty tasty roasty and “European” type stout. Plus there's enough chocolate roast to prevent this from being a charred/smokey/tobacco fest in its entirety. Not maybe my personal favorite, especially the lack in the mouthfeel, but pretty good."
Serpent's Stout,3.84,"I've wanted to try this one for quite some time, finally getting around to it... Two plus fingers of rich dark brown batter-like froth with excellent retention... Slick jet black color with limited visible carbonation... The nose is subtle but all the usual suspects are present - dark chocolate, licorice and roasted malts... The roasted malt is dialed up on the palate, but everything else holds true... Full bodied and sleek with a slightly astringent finish... Really good, but nothing remarkable..."
Serpent's Stout,4.44,"This was thick and big stout and yet surprisingly easy drinking. It is delicious.

Look: black with a very thick mocca colored head

Serpent's Stout,4,"2014 vintage; drank 10/21/15 @ the Yarchives.

Black/brown appearance.

A rough pour yielded a HUGE dark khaki head; a frothy curtain of lace.

Chocolate milk & fresh earth notes in the nose.

Thick, chalky mouthfeel.

Bakers chocolate & faint blood orange flavors up front; fresh earth notes on the finish. Faint dry booze heat notes emerged as this warmed.

This was a good RIS to me; earthy & solid."
Serpent's Stout,3.63,"Purchased at the Bruery Store in Washington, DC. Bottle caged and corked. Poured into a small stemmed tulip.

An OK imperial stout that reminds me of Founders Imperial Stout. 3.5

A – Pours a dark, black and viscous with a three-finger brown mousey head. Good head retention. A nice light brown/tan lacing. 4.25

S – Aromas of vanilla, roasted malt and then lesser coffee notes. 3.75

T – Coffee, roasted malts and light alcohol. 3.5

MF – Medium heavy bodied. 3.75"
Serpent's Stout,4.19,"Bottle from Tavour
Pours black with a finger of tan head drapey lacing, smells like sweet roated malt husks, cocoa powder with hints of chocolate fudge, roast coffee, and booze, taste is sweet and bitter dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, booze, and finishes with a fairly bitter earthy roastiness, this beer if full bodied and well carbonated. As if the apple were to turn to coal as you took a bite, the delightful curse of the serpents persuasion."
Serpent's Stout,4.05,"Look: As thick as motor oil when pouring, creating a deep black body. Slightly less than a finger of chocolate milk head with average retention.

Smell: Noticeable alcohol, cherries, chocolate, toasted bread, and some spiciness.

Taste: Slightly bitter coffee and chocolate malt, backed by mild alcohol and a little hop bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Despite pouring like motor oil, it doesn't feel as thick and creamy as you would suggest. There's also noticeable carbonation.

Overall: Actually not one of my favorites! It's still quite good, but it feels lacking compared to something like Founders Breakfast Stout."
Serpent's Stout,4.02,"Mildly bitter, alcohol not too pronounced. As others have said, a perfect winter brew."
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.37,Dark black stout with moderate head. Aroma is coffee and chocolate with a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but smooth. Taste is traditional stout with good notes of chocolate and coffee. A nice smooth finish. Overall a very good beer.
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.18,"Picked up a sixer from TW-Greenville, SC on 11-16-22 for $11.49. No canning date; consumed can #4 1-23-22.

Beer pour dark brown with a beautiful nitro like mocha head that has some nice hang time.

Nose has hints of coffee and mildly roasted malts.

Taste is a mildly roasted malt base with the coffee adjunct blended it subtlety. Finishes with a touch of cream and is well balanced with no sign of coffee astringency.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.

Overall a really nice job of incorporating the coffee adjunct. Can see my self picking this up a few times a year!"
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,3.97,wondereful creamy stout light taste of coffee great beer to enjoy
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,5,Been my favorite non barrel aged coffee beer for a couple years. 10/10 would recommend. Massive terps
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,3.61,"Relatively short lived head with almost no lacing. This smells better than it delivers. Appreciating coffee is the first listed description, but the oatmeal factor is almost missing. The lingering taste becomes bitter and the feel is way short of velvety expected with a stout, maybe because of the high ABV."
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.23,AN AWESOME BEER AT A HIGH COST 15$/6 PACK CANS
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.19,"Pours black with a medium khaki head. Scent is strongly dominated by coffee with some chocolate notes present. Taste follows, right to the edge of getting too bitter. Full mouthfeel and an aftertaste that is expected based on the scent and taste"
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.59,"Appearance:
Glacé blackness so absolute it practically absorbs the light around it. Mocha froth culminates into an abundant head that laces deeply but deflates rapidly.

Bouquet:
Homemade brownies soaked in black coffee to the point of dissolving; deep beneath that rich concoction is a slender stratum of barley and raw oats.

Feel:
A creamy cascade of velvety stout whirls about the tongue with a long-lingering mousse softness. Has a dry, earthy finish.

Taste:
A robust burst of dark chocolate syrup, followed closely by smoked oats. The midpoint exhibits spicy Arabic coffee with a sprinkling of shaved cocoa nibs stirred in. Its conclusion is a hyper-fast film reel of caramel malts and vanilla bean paste, abruptly cut by a sharp, chocolatey espresso finale.

Overall:
Marvelous. The 9.4% ABV is thoroughly cloaked under a rich deluge of dark flavors."
Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,4.18,"pours pitch black with atight khaki heady. No light getting through.Smells of subdued coffee with some chocolate and a tiny bit of char. Taste follows the nose well, coffee is a little subdued but faint flavors of chocolate come in ithe some bitterness. mouthfeels is nice and smooth with a slick feel. overall a top oatmeal stout in my book."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.5,"Hardcore, amazing imperial IPA."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.95,Sixteen ounce four pack copped from Buy Rite in South Orange. Pours a ruddy copper hue with moderate frothing. Very assertive aroma replete with strong notes of white grape and marmalade. Powerful flavors present which burst forth with ridiculous amounts of citrus-laden chewiness. Good stuff. Highly recommended.
Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.75,"A: Two plus finger building head is towering in the chalice, a creamy soft and billowy composition that is light tan in color overlays a darken tangerine color for the body. Bubbly and soapy lace ring. Hazy and dark appearance is dense and shows some macro-carbonation bubbles clinging to the vessel walls. A strong steady stream has a pretty good lasting presence of effervesce.

S: Sweetened grapefruit pulp is juicy and semi-tart along with wet grassy hop notes. Dried peaches and apricot fruit has side notes of orange-citrus upon the close with some mixed fruit presence. Good strength overall, complexity is only moderate.

T: Dank tangerine-grapefruit flavor provides a bittering first bite with a flowery edge. Big grassy dry hopping soon moves in. A touch of soapy hopping is every so slight. Resiny with a flowery bite of hops that really packs a wallop.

M: Resiny mouthful, with a follow of dry flowery lacing on the tongue. Very bitter on the hold. Small carbonation factor that really does not make nor break it either way.

O: Overall 3 Floyds makes some trueley outstanding beers that stand above the rest, unfortunately this is a mere placeholder in terms of the brewery's other accords. While solid in strength with a demanding flowery hop bitterness, I just did not find it contained a lot of complexity or malt attributes. The blunt force of hops most likely drowned out any small and subtle secondary contributions. A very bittering overlay of hops that would surely create entertainment on the noob hop drinker, but comes short in a complete aspect for me for outstanding regards."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.49,"(16 oz can, PKGD 12/28/20; purchased 4-pk off shelf... poured into a snifter, but snuck two sips from the can after the abbreviated pour)

L: I am all about head and this is one of the most amazing foam stands I've ever seen - Ramos fizz level - up and over the lip of the glass; rigid, turgid, tense... the amber liquid is grody-hazy and cumulus-cloudy... but huh what alright... little lace; ancient can???

S: grapefruit powder, laundry detergent (spring scent), orange gojo hand cream... a bit of orange spice (Tazo) and perfumy ethanol... arguably lacking a spicy zip (4.375)

T: malt muck, hop hullabaloo; bulbous expressions all around... lingering creamsicle and low-fi Earl Grey elements... SN-esque hop balance... citrus leather, malty orange, piney greenery... piney, orange-pithy ping persists...

F: wafty waifish wispiness, despite the hefty heart-hearthy hedonic homey hum... mellow, pithy tang pinging out front of a ghostly pulse... I'm lost for words; put me to sleep

O: this gave me multiple pauses... more mystery and interest and sedate sultry vibes compared to the Dreadnaught I finally had only within the last month... I may need to return to the undisclosed bunker in which I found this and negotiate some more, ooh baby... I'm not I recall the last time I met such a sipper (1741)"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.37,"This was another beer that I picked up recently at the Whole Foods in Williamsburg. Always enjoyed 3 Floyds as it’s nice to see them available in this neck of the woods again! This was a clear winner as it had plenty going for it as it fit it's ""massive IPA"" description quite nicely, down to the last sip!

The look and feel to this was reminiscent of West Coast beers as it had a gorgeous copper hue to it with a fine haze and a bit of dark sediment floating around in it. Plenty of head topped it off as the lacing was deep, extensive, and beautifully layered all the way down the side of my pint glass. Loads of pine, resin, and grapefruit in the nose along with a bit of Caramel Malt as the taste nicely followed suit. Lots of floral notes that felt like Anchor emerged in the notes as this warmed up with a nice resinous body underneath that. The back had a ton of grapefruit and lemon zest to go along with some sweet malt that almost called for a chaser of water to finish this off, except I wanted the flavor to last as long as possible!

The carbonation was softly moderate and the body was balanced as the booze was not that noticeable. Loved the label on this can as this had a packaging dated of 12/28 on the bottom of the can. Aside from that being barely legible, this was a lovable beast of a beer that easily deserved another go-around. Who knew that one of the best left coast beers came out of Indiana?"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.21,"Canned 12/28/20

And we're back with another imperial IPA from 3 Floyds. I loved their Permanent Funeral, and I'm hoping that this is in a similar vein. Regardless, I'm always on the lookout for new beers from them ever since they started distributing here in Mass. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

On first whiff, this is a promising beer. It's big and in your face while also being balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of rich caramel, bready malt, juicy orange, resiny hops, apricot, and a touch of honey

There's less of a delicate balance in the taste, but it's still good for what it is. On the front end of the sip the malt dominates and I'm tasting caramel, soft bread, lightly floral hops, and a touch of lemon zest. The swallow bitters up a bit, bringing notes of pithy grapefruit, orange marmalade, fresh pine, herbal hops, and light bready malt

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of warming alcohol

This was very good, but I've had much better from them. Still, I would get it again in a heartbeat if it was my only 3F choice"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4,"a: slightly murky dark copper color with a nice 3 finger frothy tan head

s: mango and pineapple with loads of sweet caramel and strawberry upfront. kiwi, passionfruit, and peach. candied apricots and tangerine. crackers and a touch of honey. faint grapefruit and a little bit of grass

t: sweet caramel and strawberries. pineapple and a lot of peach. peach cobbler, orange sorbet, and a nice piney bitterness. sweet melons and honeydew. grass and grapefruit towards the end. little bit of a bready malt backbone. nice hit of bitterness at the very end

m: full mouthfeel, slightly sticky. low-medium carbonation

o: a bit mellow in the flavor with a big hit of bitterness. malts are definitely noticeable, but the bitterness overrides. hops aren't too diversified, but this is a old school DIPA for sure, with more bitterness than i would have thought for a DIPA. Good, not great IMO"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.38,"Pours a hazy golden tangerine with two big fingers of head and a plethora of floaties. The nose has pine and earthy notes. The flavor is pithy with a touch of citrus that is present but way in the back. The finish starts off bitter and gets more so as one moves down the glass.

If you like candied IPAs, this ain't the beer for you!"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.54,"helluva beer, man, helluva beer. it's a hop monster - if that's not your style, you've been warned. If that *is* your style, you've been warned.
L: from the can. The can is, as it proclaims, ""not normal"".
S: basically all pine. mine might be a bit too cold. i'll note if more emerges as it warms.
T: big grapefruit hop bomb with a few floral notes. Not for the faint of heart. 3F goes big, not home.
F: smooth, rich, drying, and more bitter!
O: hey, it works for me, what can i say!?"
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.41,"Beautiful deep amber with a tall, rocky, pale doeskin head with everlasting gobstopper like retention. Rim to liquid lace drapes the glass, the nearly red-amber beer is opaque with protein haze but not flocked with suspended oat starch.
The aroma is malt - rich and sweet followed quickly by sugar dusted tangerines and honey dipped pine cones. Yummy jam on toast smells welcome the nose and entice it in for deeper snuffs. The hops could be louder but then the lovely malt would be lost. 3F's knows what they're doing.
The taste is again malt up front with a rush of hop flavors and bitterness on it's heals. More honey notes coat the tongue and help soften the barrage of hop flavors and bitter bite. Fruity flavors of pear and grapefruit mix with the spruce and pine needles and green grass notes all smothered in that honey - caramel malt sweetness in balanced complexity achieved by only the best of brewers.
The malt liquor aspect comes through at the finish which is dry and warming with a nice lingering alcohol and hop aftertaste. The priming sugar addition detracts from the overall mouth feel maybe and only offers tasteless alcohol to the mix.
The body is shy of full and the alcohol hides as I said , till the very end. A bit over dry on the back end.
Highly drinkable, superbly balanced at least up front and, in the end, extremely satisfying."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.58,"Canned 5 weeks ago.

L -- Slightly hazy copper body in the glass with two fingers of rocky off-white head produced with moderate pour. Decent retention and minimal lacing
S -- Dried pine, woodsy earthiness, booze, caramel, herbal bitters, hint of copper
T -- Big time old-school hop smack. Lots of earthy, pithy, rindy hop character and a decent honey-sweet 2-row malt backbone to the hop onslaught
F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium carb. Long, lasting, resinous bitterness on the finish
O -- Not really my style of IPA, but this is certainly a solid example of a west coast bruiser

Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.34,Good old school west coast double IPA
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.19,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/28/20, so 5-6 weeks old.

Actual hazy burnt orange/marmalade colored body. Small bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering, leaving interesting lacing.

Lightly hoppy aroma.

On tasting, pretty aggressive beer. The malt sweetness is detectable, but merely serves as a platform for an all out (panzer) assault of bitter grapefruit and pine hops.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a slightly sweet strong grapefruit hit to the palate.

Overall, after an initial shock, this one really grew on me. Excellent old style DIPA. Happy to have another 3 in the fridge."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,3.92,"L: golden hue, somewhat hazy.
S: piney and stone fruit.
T: peach flows throughout the swallow.
F: soft with a hop bite.
O: as balanced as an imperial ipa can get with massive hop additions."
Arctic Panzer Wolf,4.56,"Can purchased at One Stop Beer Shop in Greece, NY.

This one pours a light amber/dark orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells supremely resinous, with stone fruit, orange peel, piney hops, with an almost burnt aroma.

I've been wanting to try this one since basically 2014, and it's finally available to me locally. It's an uncompromising old school bruiser. The taste is placed firmly back into the IBU wars of yesteryear, with a bit piney/grassy/pithy biterness, with bitter grapefruit, orange peel, and some slightly compromising stone fruit/orange sweetness. A lot of people wouldn't like this in today's juice bomb day and age. To me, it's a really great look back in time, and it still holds up for me today.

This is a slow sipper due to the intense pithy bitterness here. As it warms, bitterness retreats slightly, with a bit more fruity hop character. There is nothing ""juicy"" about this one.

I was excited to hear this was one in town on shelves, and it's met my expectations from back in my old money days. This was a great West Coast style IPA."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.12,"Pours blacker than black with a tidy brown head that lasts quite a while and leaves a fine ring. It looks ""thick"".

The smell hit me with chocolate first then a tidal wave of roast malt, pretty close to if not burnt in some part. A bit if coffee perks thru eventually. Molasses and a small bit of dates or maybe prune.

The taste is roast malt, bittersweet chocolate, acrid coffee, a very small taste of dark fruits. A hint of milk chocolate, molasses/brown sugar and a very slight sweetness. The roast evolves into a bit of charred emptiness.

It doesn't feel as thick as I thought it would, but it is plenty thick enough. Dry and bitter finish, a slight chalky feeling and an oddly lingering sweetness."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.46,This is an awesome brew. Lots of bourbon flavor and very smooth.
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.15,"11/20/21 Marilyn's on Main in Morgantown. On tap.

Wow! Such a different imperial stout with very little sweetness. Tobacco, bitter chocolate and smokey. Finish is leather and tobacco ashes. I liked this, but DW made a face on this one!"
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.19,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle from TW-Greenville SC 7-19-21 for $2.99. Bottled 01-11-21; consumed 10-18-21.

Beer poured black as night with a very nice tan head with the original pour.

Nose is nice, roasted malt city which gives you the essence of what is about to come.

Taste is a blast of roasted malts that lend a touch of chocolate and toastiness. Finishes well balanced with no trace of residual sweetness and alcohol burn.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very creamy and smooth.

Overall a really likable imperial stout, reminds me of Bell's Expedition stout but slightly smaller which is not a bad thing!"
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.31,"You could tell me this had cocoa in it and I’d believe it. Great no barrel no adjunct RIS. Hefty, but drinkable too"
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.09,I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf from my local Giant Eagle store. It poured an opaque dark with very thin ran ring head that is not leaving any lace. The scent had bourbon and vanilla notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with molasses and bourbon highlights. The mouthfeel was medium in body and had good carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer.
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.86,"And now, back to our already scheduled brewery horizontal, already in progress. This beer continues yet another (!) brewery horizontal as I work to eradicate the Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody. I am thinking that these must have been part of a mixed-12 pack or a case at Country Garden Six Pack (CG6P) at one point & then they decided to single them out. No matter to me! I was happy to take one of each. I usually go lowest to highest in terms of ABV, but the first one was slightly out of turn due to the previous beer also being an Oktoberfest/Märzen. Please forgive my transgression as I get things back on track!

From the Bottle: ""Unleash the Flavor""; ""Imperial Stouts are by far the ""GRAND - DADDY"" of all stouts. They are very, very dark and rich, with a deep-roasted, satisfying flavor. Siberian Night is made in this tradition. It is creamy and full-bodied, with a complex character from generous amounts of roasted, toasted, and caramel malts. For those who demand flavor, this is the perfect libation. Bronze medal winner at the 2003 Great American Beer Festival.""; ""IBU's = 58, OG = 25° P""; ""2006 G.A.B.F. Bronze Medal[,] 2005 G.A.B.F.

I was curious to Pop! the cap on this one since, given its fairly wide availability, I wondered how/why I had not reviewed it before now. No time like the present, beginning with the Pop! of the cap, followed by a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting glass. I was quickly rewarded with the formation of two-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with very good retention, leaving a load of lacing in its wake as it fell. Color was obsidian Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing ZERO light penetration. 8=O Nose had a rich, coffee-like roastiness along with Baker's (bittersweet) chocolate and a light charcoal smokiness. Mmm. Mouthfeel was big, full & creamy, like a dollop had been scooped into my mouth & onto my tongue! 8=O The taste was dark-roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, charcoal smoke, anise/licorice & treacle. They definitely got the Style right because even though it may have been made by an American brewer(y), that does NOT make it an ARIS by extension. I could not perceive the presence of any hops, so if that is what you are after, look elsewhere. Finish was dry, very roasty & lingering. The scary part was how well the alcohol was hidden! This was super smooth & required constant glances at the speedometer to ensure that I did not fly through it. Eek! YMMV."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.66,"From frige 12 oz. bottle (bottled on 1/10/19 date on the bottle, 9% ABV and 58 IBUs also on the bottle ) to the tulip.

Feel - smooth and creamy. Overall - wow this is well made stout. Left bottle for aging."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.37,"This beer is an old favorite, many a good times.
12 oz bottle poured dirty into a snifter. Thick and rich brown foam head. Can already smell the roast coffee from the pour. Stuff is nearly black in color. It's a delicious malty slam to the taste buds with a very slight bitterness. Has a medium viscosity and salivates the palette. The beer is great, but... the picture quality of the wolf on the label has truly got to be one of the shittiest beer labels I ever saw. Just sayin' :)"
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,3.96,"Good beer, a little bit too sweet."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.05,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours nearly pitch black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a sparse, patchythat dissipates to spare bubbles, but with ok light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, a hint of caramel and some ethanol; slight oxidation. Flavor is dark toasted malt, milk chocolate, coffee, tobacco and light vanilla. Flavor thins out in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. A lucky find in So. Cal, on a ""cellared beer"" shelf, so presumably properly cellared. Sadly, no date on the bottle, but I'm guessing this is at least 3 years old from the flavor and oxidation in the aroma. The malt is rich and well flavored, but has thinned out somewhat from a full bodied RIS profile. A nice stout, but perhaps cellared a hair too long. I like it enough that I hope to see Thirsty Dog again and would definitely pick this up in a more recent bottle."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.17,2015 bottle enjoyed in 2018. I receive this in a trade and consumed it shortly after. I remember it being chocolatey. Would definitely some when I get a chance and would love to see it age further.

Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.27,"Received on a trade

Nice roasty malt, perfect carbonation, very creamy feel and just a tick of bitterness. Very nice Russian Imperial Stout, at a good abv."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.25,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam that retains well. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty and earthy malts that incorporate a tinge of bitterness. Toffee and dark chocolate add a little complexity, but overall the aroma is centered on dark malts. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty malts with smokey, earthy, nutty malts finishing it out. Despite a slight bitterness to the aroma, the flavor profile is smooth with a lightly sweet opening. Caramel and toffee add the sweetness. Mouth feel is velvety with a thick consistency. Overall, splendid and dark, with the smokiness at the end driving this stout a slightly different direction from its relatives. That route is slightly more bitter.

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 12oz bottle."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.02,"12 oz bottle poured into Tallgrass globe snifter.

Really deep dark silky black color with a beige head of 1 finger.

Flavor is not unnecessarily harsh like the nose would suggest. It is of milk chocolate and char, but it's not overly ashy or bitter. Some piney hop bitterness in the background hanging heavy, with slight caramel, tobacco, and hints of fig. The more it warms up however the milk chocolate notes fade and the piney bitterness takes over.

Feel is creamy with a moderate carbonation and a ridiculously roasty feel throughout the whole profile. It ends dry as sandpaper with tons of roast and lingering resins.

Overall, a very deep sipper that is extremely dry and heavy with lots of roast and minimal sweetness (especially as it comes closer to room temp). Luckily the barrel aged version brings the sweetness that's missing from the original. Decent beer on a cold day or night."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.15,"Pours a thick black color, viscous in appearance. Not much of a head, which dissipates entirely.
Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and a hint of alcohol.
There is an underlying sweetness in the taste, however, the roasted malts add an assertive bitterness that evoke raw cacao, dark chocolate, coffee beans, lightly charred and smoky malts. The finish is dry and with a strong espresso bean bitter linger. As the drink warms, sweetness develops, evoking chocolate and creamy malts.
Full bodied, gently carbonated and smooth. Although big bodied and with a high abv, it is easy to drink.
Finely crafted stout that hides its alcohol well, has a nice balance and complexity."
Siberian Night Imperial Stout,4.33,"Sampled September 2018 from 12oz bottle in pint glass. I did not see any brewed or bottled on date listed on the bottle.

Appearance: Very dark black, dark color, with a dark tan head of 2 fingers. The head flattened a little but lasted a very long time. The head left a coating on the glass.

Smell: There are roasted malt aromas, coffee, and a little chocolate in the aroma. Nice combination and balance between the hops, malts, and other aromas.

Taste: Strong coffee and burnt malt flavors. Full-bodied with nice balance of malt and some hop bitterness. It is very smooth. There is a hint of sweetness like chocolate that may be due to the oats and malts, but it has an excellent taste. Light hop flavor as well.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, with strong alcohol which matches with the 9.7% on the label.

Overall: This was the first time I tried anything from Thirsty Dog. Overall Siberian Night is a very good Imperial stout. It has strong flavors as well as alcohol, and the mix of malts and hops makes for a unique and interesting stout. I would buy this again."
Jammy,4.36,Bottle shared by Hopelessly0.
Jammy,3.73,"750 mL bottle. Deep red. Smells of deep berry, earthy notes, and vinous acidity. Tastes of sharp blackberry. Earthy and oaky behind it. Pretty sour, but doesn't hit the nose or ever turn acetic. Medium body with low carbonation. I don't know if ""Jammy"" is the word I'd use to describe this, but it's a nice blackberry sour."
Jammy,4.49,"Blend 3

Would have loved to do a side by side with the Casey Jammy.

Looks spectacular with great head retention.
Smells like a handful of blackberries.
Tastes as the name denotes, blackberry jam, with some funk and oak along side. Not too tart.
Overall a wonderful beer."
Jammy,4.5,Fruit forward but soooo good
Dirty Bastard,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, bottled on 7/21/22

On the pour a fine khaki 2 finger head formed then slowly receded and became rocky, as well as clinging to the glass. The body is a nice amber to red with light carbonation. Beautiful lacing.

Aroma is big sweet caramel toffee malts with just the right amount of lightly fruity british ale yeast. Not as big smelling as I expected.

Taste is huge. At first it's all the malt and the yeast notes, before a big wave of bitter hops come to balance the almost candy like malts. A decent bit of alcohol can be tasted as well but it works with everything else going on. The finish is almost holiday spicey, with a bit of sweetness. It would pair well with whiskey, although it's not quite as spirit adjacent as a barrel aged beer nor as smoky as a Rauchbier. Honestly a nice change of pace withing my preferred category of malty beers without the change just being to add American hops.

Feel is very mouthcoating with a light to medium carbonation, but this beer has quite a body to it. On the lips it feels thicker than water, and it almost slides down the throat, but it's very smooth. At the same time there is a bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol which definitely slows me down a bit, but this type of beer is meant to be savored, not to refresh.

Overall this was a very enjoyable wee heavy scotch ale. A bit more hoppy than most are, but they aren't fruity, just big bitter, and I think European as well. Big malts shine and are sweet but nicely balanced, and a great beer to kick off the fall season here."
Dirty Bastard,4.06,"Milk chocolate brown, reddish shine, large tan head retains well and leaves decent lacing. Smell reminds me a little of some wheat beers I don’t really like. Taste of rich biscuity malt, good sweetness as well, but a little alcoholic in flavor. Feel is average. Want to drink again sometime."
Dirty Bastard,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter at fridge temp. Rich foam, good retention. Sweet on the nose, toffee, medium roastiness. Taste is classic wee heavy with a nice hop note. Perfect carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a tasty treat that’s on the button and not overpowering."
Dirty Bastard,4.32,"Dirty Bastard dumped into a 20oz. glass out of a 12oz. bottle. Picture perfect dark brew slight amber shade when held up to a light. There was a solid three finger dark, thick, tan head. The foam retention is excellent! This is clear enough that when held up to the light I can observe a high amount of carbonation.
The aroma is a pleasant sweet roasted malts, and caramel notes.
The flavor is sweet caramel but dry, with a light bitter finish.
The feel is medium, dry as I said, the carbonation is not prevalent on the tongue, after several sips and the brew warms I can pick up a bit of ABV heat, but it does not take away from the enjoyment of the flavor or session.
This is a very good Scotch Ale, one that I will revisit."
Dirty Bastard,4.18,I love strong ales. This ale is one of my favorites!
Dirty Bastard,4.78,First time trying this beer and I have to say it's pretty darn good. As soon as I saw the color I was thinking Guinness but taste completely different than how it looks. Smooth going down especially on a hot summer day. Definitely going to have to get this around to friends to try
Dirty Bastard,4.09,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. dark copper in color, lightly hazy with some suspended particles. one finger head with excellent lacing retention.

Smell - caramel, toffee, and lots of malty sweetness. some booze detectable. warm spices and yeast also detectable.

Taste - an explosion of malt flavor and some syrupy sweetness, though also balanced with bitterness. not much smokiness, contrary to what is advertised on the bottle. finish is warm. heavy, but not overwhelmingly so.

Feel - medium-full bodied, low carbonation, and on the heavier side at 8.5% ABV. alcohol is not masked but is not harsh. in fact, the warmness gives this beer an extra layer of added complexity.

Overall - a very complex and very tasty malt-heavy beer that showcases a wide range of flavor while remaining surprisingly drinkable."
Dirty Bastard,4.01,"April 30, 2022 - Dark copper, crystal clear, so dark you must hold it up to a light to see through it. Fluffy, lacy tan head, recedes slowly; I like the aroma, faint as it is to my invalid sniffer; Fully robust in flavor, a little tangy; Not a particularly robust mouthfeel, mild carbonation, but not bad. I like this beer. I expect I'll get it again."
Dirty Bastard,3.97,"Enjoyed with Lee, 3/13/22"
Dirty Bastard,4.15,"Appearance: Pours a very very dark ruby red color, verging on brown. Tan colored head disappeared in a flash.

Smell: Brown sugar, Coca-Cola, oatmeal cookies.

Taste: Brown sugar and dark bread up front. The sweetness and bitterness duke each other out half way through. Towards the finish I get a bit of charred coffee grounds and a sweet toasted caramel note. Nutty and dry finish. Balanced.

Feel: Medium bodied, well carbonated. No alcohol warmth.

Overall: Great beer."
Dirty Bastard,4.41,"I’ve heard so much hype surrounding Founders that I decided I’d finally give them a try, I would have sooner if it weren’t for the price. The Dirty Bastard seemed the most likely to be up my alley. After arriving home to pour into a glass and take my first sip, I immediately realize what I’ve been missing. This beer hit me on the first sip with such rich and delightful flavor, something that you kind of take for granted in beer when you’re not used to it. Instead of trying to explain the soul of this ale, I just want to say that this was a perfect first try from this brewery and really enjoyed the experience the beer brought me."
Dirty Bastard,3.73,Drier finish than my tastebuds can handle
Dirty Bastard,4.13,"Purchased as a single bottle from Ingles for $1.50. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a pitch black, but copper when held to the light. One-finger tan head with fantastic lacing.
S - Brown sugar, oak smoke, and Cohiba Red Dots. A broad sense of earthiness, but I can't be really specific.
T - Deep dark caramels, brown bread, and molasses. Darkened toast comes through the most, though. Bitter, but not overbearingly so; it goes well with this brew. Ethanol comes through towards the end of the glass.
F - Warms your body like nothing else! Smooth. Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Very heavy.
O - A fantastic ale, well-worth trying out. This would be perfect as a bonfire-with-friends-beer. Go out and try it!"
Dirty Bastard,4.05,"12 oz bottle dated 12/2/20

Cloudy copper-brown with golden highlights. Two fingers variegated tan head. Spotty lacing with a full ring and large continents on the surface.
Malty molasses, tobacco, brown sugar, oak, berry aromas.
Char and peat in the taste, along with black bread, oak, toffee, floral hops, light mineral flavors.
Good carbonation, noticeable alcohol heat, bitter aftertaste, medium bodied.
Good depth of flavors which richer with warming. This bottle is a year old and shows no ill effects."
Dirty Bastard,4.26,"Bottled 11/23/21. Poured at 57°. Deep amber/ruby brown body with excellent clarity; three fingers of khaki mixed bubbles foam; looong cap retention; heavy minus lacing and heavy ring; medium legs on swirl. Caramel malt and floral hops nose; light smokiness as beer warms. Bitter hops on entry, with caramel sweetness right behind; mild nuttiness; dry finish. Silky plus feel; medium plus body; moderate minus carbonation; no warmth from 8.5% abv. Overall, a beautiful beer and outstanding; easy drinking and smooth; I do like the Backwoods better, as Dirty is lighter in comparison; nevertheless, an enjoyable beer."
Dirty Bastard,4.27,"L: Darkish amber, off white 2 inch head, mild lacing.

S: yep

An old fashion with a hint of Abbey ale. I feel like a shmuck for looking down on this beer.

F: carbonation medium-heavy yadda yadda the flavor kills tho

O: great try it"
Dirty Bastard,3.35,"Good look ale, bronze/ golden color. Frothy head and left ample lacing in a pint glass. Taste followed aroma, a bit tart that lingered around in the aftertaste. Overall enjoyable and good representation of the beer type."
Dirty Bastard,4.18,"10/17/21 From bottle from 4 pack.... Gift from DW for 51st birthday. Stone, mahogany, maple, smoke, leather, salty, malty, The depths of flavors is amazing. Certainly sweet, but the hop end balances things out. Boozy. I picture really enjoying this fireside at the end of a good day of skiing!"
Dirty Bastard,4.27,Dark and beautiful makes me feel like a bastard
Older Viscosity,4.36,"Served in a snifter glass from the bottle.

Appearance: Dark black color with medium bubbles to the body. Tan head off the body which rose maybe one finger's length. Dropped to almost nada after two or three sips. No lacing at all due to the slightly thin body.

Smell: Heavy brown sugar, smells warm...as if it was melted in a saucepan with the coffee brewing next to it.

Taste: complex and sweet...molasses overdose which hits your with a touch of espresso and whiskey to go with.

Mouth: sticky brew, medium carbonation. Sweet finish which lingers in the mouth cheeks for a very very long time.

Overall: Whiskey heavy which you get no complaints from me. Soft carbonation with the most everlasting stickiness to the brew. Salud!"
Older Viscosity,4.13,"12.7 fl.oz. corked bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 12.0%. Pitch black colour, moderate tan head. Intense aroma of sweet malts, bourbon whiskey, vanilla and oak, also moderate roasty notes, hints of chocolate and liquorice. Very sweet (too sweet?) and intense flavour, sweet malts galore, notes of bourbon, oak and vanilla again, also notes of mild coffee, dark chocolate and liquorice. Moderate hops."
Older Viscosity,4.69,"2010 bottle, drank 2020. Definitely waited too long, and this bottle definitely wasn't kept in optimal conditions over the years, but based on my ratings, I really enjoyed this...!!

Smelled wonderfully bourbonny and stouty. Wasn't flat but had lost an element of carbonation. Taste was nicely bourbon stout, not char or roast but a enough in that direction to let you know it was a traditional stout. Can't believe this bad boy has fallen so far in ratings over the years in the face of pastry stouts. I'm going to see if I can find a more recent bottle just to have one on hand as this is too good to not revisit now and then. Cheers!"
Older Viscosity,4.54,"Stamped Vintage 2014-A. Pours black, minimal head, not as viscous as you'd think. Bourbon smell, chocolate. Mouthfeel isn't very thick, but crazy smooth. Taste is amazing. Lots of soft bourbon, plenty of chocolate, old leather, hint of moccha. Crazy soft."
Older Viscosity,4.31,"L: Pitch with a toffee ring of a head.

S: Roasts of all kinds: roasted raw sugars, vanilla beans, coffee, and a touch of pure char. This is mostly roast and bourbony-vanilla notes.

T: Like an oaky oatmeal stout that has seen it's day in a barrel. Vanilla for days - coffee roastiness and some minimal chocolate.

F: Smooth and coating medium-heavy feel. Not a stand-out in its viscosity in my view.

O: Clearly this beer holds up for a long time based on the 8 year vintage below. Mine was a 2014 vintage tried in 2019 and a five years I imagined it had lost something. My friend, an older viscosity expert, agreed it had. We presume on that collective experience that three years is likely ideal aging. But this was solid nonetheless."
Older Viscosity,3.75,"Bottled 2014; drank 8/16/14 @ the Yarchives.

Brown/black hue.

Dark khaki head; nice lace.

Cream, caramel & booze heat in the nose.

Medium thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Milk, oak, aluminum & dark caramel up front; booze heat on the finish.

Decent; too young?!"
Older Viscosity,4.19,"About as nice as a stout can be. No aftertaste, but really nice mild chocolate, vanilla, nutmeg and very smooth and silky. A warm beer when you need one."
Older Viscosity,4.21,"In review is a 2011 vintage.

A - Pitch black pour with micro-thin toffee colored lacing and no carbonation at all. Appearance is flat but lots of legs on the sides of the glass.

S - Dark chocolate, some delicate black licorice, oak, slightly boozy on the nose, some dark sugar and molasses.

T - Light coffee, dark chocolate, oak tannin, bourbon, delicate traces of dark fruit and molasses on the very back end.

M - Silky, viscous, and sticky on the lips with some slight warming in the back of the throat.

O - This held up incredibly well for being a 2011 vintage. Impressed."
Older Viscosity,3.75,"De Cafestes. En copa Teku. Viendo Multiple. Suave y equilibrada en sabores, quizas demasiado hasta el punto de echarse en falta personalidad. Su abv la hace lenta de beber"
Older Viscosity,4.13,"Pick this beer up earlier this year and kept it in my cellar until now. The beer is 47 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The hard pour on the beer produced a half finger head with zero retention. The head was hard to discern any information as to what the head looks like and so forth. The color of the beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearly black beer and opaque.

The aromas in the beer are molasses, dark chocolate, medium roasted coffee, toffee, dark roasted malts, caramel, alcohol, burnt sugar, and yeast.

The flavors in the beer are dark roasted malts, molasses, medium roasted coffee, toffee, caramel, alcohol, burnt sugar, char, and bready.

The mouthfeel of the beer is chewy and dry.

The body of the beer full, low carbonation, and a full finish.

The beer is a bit of a letdown, good beer but could be so much better."
Older Viscosity,4.4,"Vintage 2014

A: A black stout with no visible carbonation and no light passing through. After an aggressive pour, the light brown head dissipates into a thin ring around the edge of the glass. Barely any sticky lacing as I drink the beer.

S: Dark chocolate and espresso coffee dominate, followed a hint of oak. These dry aromas are balanced nicely by sweet vanilla, coconut, and dark dried fruit including raisin, date and dark chocolate covered raspberry jelly. A pinch of cinnamon. Booze comes through pleasantly and warm as cherry cordial. This does not smell like an overly sweet beer or a overly woody beer.

T: This is an espresso coffee and semi sweet chocolate forward stout with enough vanilla and coconut to let you know that it’s been aged in a bourbon barrel. The dark fruit aromas mentioned above really come through on the palate as the beer warms up.

M: Flat and aqueous.

D: At 12% ABV this bourbon barrel aged stout is highly drinkable. The alcohol adds to both the aroma and flavor profile with out being unpleasant or distracting. This is not the thickest, most barrel forward BBA stout out there. But that’s what makes the beer so great. The array of flavors, most notably the dark fruit, raspberry and cherry flavors and delectable, and pair heavenly with the coffee and chocolate.

This beer has been stored in my basement that hovers around 60 degrees all year round, without being moved at all. Zero oxidation or off flavors. Safe to say that time has done this beer well. If I had any more, which unfortunately I do not, I would drink them right now."
Older Viscosity,4.33,"Bottled 2013.
Moderate to vigorous pour yields no head, no lacing with a black body. Nose of roasted malts, dark fruit, chocolate, and booze. Taste mirrors nose with a rather thin feel. Finish is very nice bitter chocolate and a bit of bourbon. Overall, I guess I may have waited a tad too long to open this. Live and learn."
Older Viscosity,4.44,"***2014 Vintage***
Pours pitch black, minimal tan head. Aromas of chocolate, molasses, vanilla, faint coffee, anise. Big chocolate : bourbon barrel flavor up front, an interesting anise flavor in the middle, plenty of brown sugar and vanilla that lingers after you swallow. Decent carbonation (especially for a 3 year old beer), fairly full bodied and creamy.. Overall this is a nice example of the style. ABV is well hidden.

4.5 rating"
Older Viscosity,4.37,"Solid ba stout. Pours thick with a dark cola colored head that quickly dissipates and leaves almost no trace of its existence except for a few whisps. Smell is classic ba stout; a touch of vanilla, woodsy, booze and roast. Even though the nose is classic, the barrel presence is not overt. Taste is chocolatey and bittersweet. A little bourbon booze on the back end but still pleasant. A little too carbonated for the style and my own tastes but others would probably find it right on point as it is silky and thickish. Overall I would have liked more out of the nose but is still one great ba stout."
Older Viscosity,4.09,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a pure dark black color with a nice looking finger’s worth of off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Adequate messy lace. The aroma had some roasty coffee beans up front with a slight milk chocolate, and then dark chocolate, quite robust. Vanilla and some woody sweetness round it out. The flavor pulls a drying sweetness from the blend of the wood to the coffee beans and malts to play with a rugged semi-sweet and bitter aftertaste. Leads with a semi-sticky sort of roasty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sipping quality about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt right as where the brewer said it does. Overall, really nice Winter sipper if anything, I'd have again."
Older Viscosity,4.06,"Older Viscosity bottle purchased at Binny's in Chicago in 2015. After that, it sat in my makeshift cellar in Alabama for a year. Opened in Texas in April of 2017. This bottle has been on a long journey with me. For no particular reason, I decided to dome it on a random Saturday night.

It's a thick-looking beer, but what little head it has disappears immediately, leaving a flat-looking stout behind. If I tilt it or swirl it, I can see thick legs, which is not surprising, given its 12% ABV.

The smell is mostly chocolate, oak, bourbon, and booze. Normally, that would be perfect for me, but for some reason, the smell is strong initially but disappears almost immediately.

The flavor also contains chocolate, malt, oak, bourbon, maybe a dark and savory fruit like raisins or figs, and alcohol. The alcohol is warming but borderline burning.

I can feel the alcohol as much as I can taste it. It burns the tongue a bit. Also, the beer feels just as flat as it looks. I'm used to barrel-aged stouts having less carbonation, but this one seems almost lifeless.

I remember drinking this for the first time on tap at the South Loop Binny's in Chicago back in 2015. Even after drinking a couple different vintages of BCBS and a Bourbon Barrel Plead the Fifth (all on tap there... it was a good night), I remember being impressed with Older Viscosity. I still think it's a good, solid bourbon-barrel-aged stout, but drinking it on its own tonight, I feel like it's missing something. I'm glad I got to drink it more than once, but this 12.7oz bottle cost me $18.49. At that price, I probably wouldn't buy it again."
Dreadnaught,4.44,"Found this classic at Gary's in Madison not too long ago, as I never had this before. Love 3 Floyds and was glad to see them return to this neck of the woods recently as they were one of the breweries that got me into craft beer, well over 15 years ago. Indeed, this was worth the hype as it's still one of the better Imperial IPA's after all of these years!

Such a beautiful copper hue to this as it was topped off with a ton of head that made this look like a loaf of bread, but with hops. Gorgeous, layered lacing stayed behind as I worked my way through this as I don't think I've ever seen so many rings on my glass at one time. Caramel, earthy hops, pine, dark bread, stone fruit, and a bit of tea spice were in the nose as the taste was just as deep, varied, and enjoyable. This wasn't weak but didn't quite feel as strong as it's listed ABV%, which made this that much more impressive. Toasted malt, weed, and a hint of chocolate stuck around in the back as this was a wonderfully layered beer that opened up nicely once it fully warmed.

This was strong but in the sense that there was so much flavor here as the alcohol was on par with everything else going on. Packaged on 3/21, this held up amazingly well and would be something that I'd easily reach for again. Really impressed with this as I'm glad that this is available here as I can't recommend this enough. It's easily worth it's lofty rating on here as this was an old-school brew that's easily withstood the test of time!"
Dreadnaught,4.43,"16oz can from Beers of the World. Golden pour with a white fluffy head. Fruity, malty aroma, caramel, pine. Taste is some piney, mildly astringent hops coupled with sweet toffee notes. Bitterness and warmth rise up at the finish."
Dreadnaught,4.38,"ABV: 9.4%
IBU: 86
BOF #42 (currently)

Clear deep amber. Moderately carbonated. Very tall off-white head. The head is thick and creamy appearing with excellent retention. The surface becomes rocky and pitted as it does slowly recede.

The aroma is old-school IPA. Citrus – grapefruit, hints of pine and resin. Melon. Crackers and bread.

The initial taste favors the crackers and melon for the first few milliseconds, but with the grapefruit and pine coming quickly and dominating. Yet, these flavors back off a bit near the finish with a woody tannin and hops bitterness sharpening the end. The aftertaste lingering is bitter grapefruit, tannin and pine, and bitter. And, yet, the finish and aftertaste is on the sweet side. The alcohol is nowhere to be found except in the eventual buzz. The bitterness in the aftertaste intensifies as I progress through the beer, but if anything, that just makes this beer even better. Very well balanced.

The mouth feel is substantial – creamy, thick even for an IPA.

Overall, this is in line with my expectations. That may sound less than high praise, except that my expectations were quite high to begin with given the brewer and the BOF rank of this beer. An excellent DIPA. One to enjoy. Those of the juicy hazy milkshake “IPA” crowd, well, you should just move along."
Dreadnaught,3.91,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 03/21/22""
There is some text below that but it has a big ink blot on it and can't be read.

Appearance: The body is a nice medium gold and light sun tea color. It has good clarity with a light opalescence. There is a medium-sized frothy white head with both very good head retention and good lacing.

Aroma: It has a pleasant wildflower aroma which is obvious and present but not strong. There are hints of hay-grass and pollen. A light mint aroma as well. It smells good.

Taste: Up front there is a light bit of peach with a touch of spearmint. Towards the middle of the mouth there is this light bit of caramel and some pleasant mint flavor. There are earthy notes of oak and twig with hints of tea leaf. Towards the back of the palate there is more of an earthy mint character. It finishes with a bit of cocoa chocolate flavor and toasted oak. It has a lot of complex and interesting flavors.

Mouthfeel: The body feels clean and on the lower side of medium bodied. It sticks to the tongue when it needs to but leaves it when appropriate. It has a medium hop bitterness and what feels like a bit of grain bitterness. Great carbonation.

Overall: It's a solid beer. It has a bit more of an earthy focus with mint notes and hints of oak, giving the beer a lot of depth and complexity. It isn't really an East Coast or West Coast style Imperial IPA which is kind-of fitting for a brewery located in Indiana. 3 Floyds really seems to hit their stride in this beer. By the time the glass is gone you want another one. I highly recommend it, and it's worth picking up at least a 4-pack. I would definitely drink it again. The highlight in this beer is the woody, oaky character that it has."
Dreadnaught,3.89,"6 oz mini-snifter pour at Lures Bar & Grille. Excited to finally try one of the OG pine/caramel WCIPAs. Pours a reddish caramel color with a smallish off-white head. Aroma and flavor feature caramel, pine, citrus rind, and booze. Mouthfeel is somewhat harsh and boozy. Overall: I've had some great old-school WCIPAs recently (Double Dale's is excellent) but this isn't one of the better ones."
Dreadnaught,4.18,"If I read the label of this great brew I might not have expected the genuine bitterness with not a hint of the usual juicy finish. I'm not disappointed, I just wasn't ready for what was to come. At $5.16 it is a poor value. My sample is exactly one month old.

It pours golden, translucent and fizzy. The aroma is pretty intense if you really go in for it - nice and citrusy. The taste is all dark malty and bitter hops with a thick and very bitter finish.

Recommended. I like a lot of 3 Floyds stuff, and this one is like the extra large version, with an extra bitter profile. Overpriced."
Dreadnaught,4.4,"Haven't had this beer in a long time. I found a 4-pack of tall boys dated two weeks out. Very fresh! How could I resist. This is your classic old school DIPA. Pours a mostly clear amber color, with a giant frothy head that sticks around forever. Aroma has some nice citrus notes with a touch of pine. Flavor is classic, while the hops steal the show, mostly an orangey citrus but some nice pine sap too, there is a nice malt presence, reminiscent if lightly toasted biscuits. Finishes fairly bitter, while the impression is borderline sweet, overall the palate remains dry with a lingering bitterness. Damn, I miss DIPAs (and IPAs in gereal) like this. So tasty! Yes, you can still find old school DIPAs, but they seem to get lost in the sea of hazies."
Dreadnaught,4.38,"Old school DIPA from Three Floyd’s. I’ve been so happy since we’ve started getting tons of their beers, including the barrel aged bottles. I love getting to drink these reasonably priced old school IPAs. This one pours a clear dark gold, with aroma of citrus, tastes slightly bitter, a bit of malt sweetness making the taste almost of lemons and oranges mixed together. Great west coast DIPA."
Dreadnaught,4.5,"So I'm updating from my 2013 rating. I gave it a 4.5 then. This probably isn't a good comparison.
I stopped by Glendale Liquors on Rt. 27 in South Brunswick and saw Dreadnaught, and didn't even give any thought to the $18/4pack price. Until sitting here looking at reviews and warming up on a Nugget Nectar, I never even thought to check the date. But I saw a review that says 3F have discontinued this beer. So I looked. I can barely make it out, but there it is, ""Pkgd on 2/14/21.""
Apparently, Glendale charged me $18/4 for a year old beer. Shame on me for trusting them. But lets see how it is aged. At 9.4% ABV, its got to retain something, though I don't expect it to be hops.
So it looks like a fine NE IPA...dirty blonde color with a good head, so hazy, its opaque...I'm trying to remember if its unfiltered? Do they do that in Indiana?
Age has definitely impacted the nose. I'm getting a moderately sweet, breadyness with no trace of pine or citrus.
Age hasn't been kind to the flavor, either. mostly that barleywineish sweetness with bitterness around the edges. Mouthfeel is still very chewy and quite lovely. But I won't add ratings to waterdown what I gave before.
But after a year, i'd give it 4.25, 3, 2.5, 4.25, 3.25.
And a warning to doublecheck the dates when you think you found something good at Glendale Liquors on Rt 27!!!!"
Dreadnaught,4.47,"I am usually more an APA drinker with the occasional gem of an IPA. My last was Pliny the Elder. I was not expecting to reminisce of it from 3 Floyds, and from a $4.99 4-pack, no less.

A refreshing looking amber hue with candied pine on the nose. A burst of citrus ages to tropical fruit over a few seconds, then a pop of pepper and a grapefruit finish. It finishes with strong herbal notes that never overpower. A light, creamy orange washes over the palate soon after.

Just an absolute pleasure. I've been a big fan of 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust, but found their other variations much more of the same. Dreadnaught was expected to disappoint. I wondered why it was the last pack on the rack. I wonder no longer. World-Class, indeed."
Dreadnaught,4.4,"Pours a translucent golden color with a large fluffy head that ends up as lots of lacing.

Initially smells of slightly dank piney hops. A warmer glass adds grapefruit and pine apple.

Tastes of piney hops with sweet malt upfront with citrus and pineapple coming out as my glass got warmer. It has a slightly bitter and boozy finish.

This is a not overly assertive west coast IPA with some sweeter nuances and a punch.

Medium body with light carbonation. Light dry mouthfeel."
Dreadnaught,4.25,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 2/15/21, so 4 months old.

Looks outstanding in the glass. Clear pale amber body with a massive cream colored head. This slowly dissipates to a collar and solid covering, leaving layers of lacing.

Not much of an aroma here, not that I have much of a nose. A little musty fruit.

On tasting, a strong sweet malty wave washes through the mouth. Just when you start to think ""malt bomb?"", the palate is attacked by a pine/resin/grapefruit assault. Like 2 beers in one. Me liking this.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish pine citrus bitterness.

Overall, just an outstanding old school dipa. Would love to compare this 4 month old can with one fresh off the line. Holds up extremely well."
Dreadnaught,4.75,"Review 1549
Continuing with Three Floyds Beer, Dreadnaught is next. The last Pale ale was tasty, looking forward to this one. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy, foamy, and creamy with excellent retention. The dissipation left chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with orange hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with a few yeast floaties. A stellar presentation for the beer.

I first detect pine, grapefruit, floral esters, and resin. Next, I smell biscuits, lemons, a touch of passion fruit, wet grass, phenols, caramel, and a hint of dankness.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, resin, pine needles, lemons, pineapple, fruity esters, phenols, oranges, caramel, a wee bit of toffee, malty sweetness, grapefruit, herbal, and a hint of pharmaceutical.
The mouthfeel of the beer is warming, astringent, and tannic.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.

This is a perfect example of Imperial IPA. The hop profile is extraordinary. The malt backbone is firm but not overbearing. It reminds me of Ruination, but better. I am enjoying this beer."
Dreadnaught,4.53,"This, I think, is my first rating in NINE years. (I've done a lot in the intervening time on Untappd, but BA will always have a soft spot for me.)

So, as I understand it, FFF is no long producing this beer. I bought it recently for a mere $9 from a local shop. It was bottled April 2018.

I first had this beer a good 20-odd years back. This sample reminded me how incredible FFF is. Although this has citrus and mango fruits in the mix, at 3+ years, those fruits have ceded to the malts, pine and...a nice, dry finish.

I need to get back to that local beer shop and my the remaining stock of these big berthas. I think they had 5 or 6 remaining and in a fridge.

Gonna miss it when it's gone, but enjoying it now immediately transports me back 20 years. Ahhhh..."
Dreadnaught,4.28,"-orange-amber can pour with a slight haze and a sticky foam cap.
The aroma is of pine and orange.
The flavor is resinous with orange marmalade prominent and melon included.

LOOK: medium hazy, big creamy cream colored head. excellent retenion.

AROMA: pine, hay orange rind,

TASTE: citrus and pine, hint of sweetness upfront with a tasty bitter finish,

FEEL: medium body and creamy; well balanced.

Very good. I was thinking that despite this beers reputation that it was not up my alley, but it is quite tasty and enjoyable. Great balance. Zombie Dust on Steroids.

Imperial Stout,4.15,From a 550ml bottle. Jet black with a quarter inch of medium brown head. Smells of roasted malt. Full bodied. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors with some hop bitterness on the finish. Well done. I'm so used to the high-octane RIS that it's interesting to get this style at only 7%.
Imperial Stout,4.39,"Pours an excellent, dirthy, viscous and full bodied dark, deep black. No light bleed. Head is hanging around and is deep earthy brown. Nose gives huge elements of baltic porter, like zywiec or black boss: toffee, caramalt and some solid residual brown sugar leading into a hint of oxidized hops (nose), liqourice (licorice?), plum, cane sugar, maybe some smoke (but the weber is going so who knows)

Hell of a beer, really complex. Those notes above all pertain just the same in the flavor, but just in phases. Like from fruity to chocolatey to smokey and on and on just evolving."
Imperial Stout,4.19,"Poured into a tulip a nice black colored liquid capped by a light brown head that was dense and soft looking. Dissipated fairly quickly but still looks good.
The aroma was roasted malts, and for me that is impressive, my nose is broke as far as aroma goes.
The taste, I was somewhat impressed- for a RIS it was very smooth, as in no charred malts and no extra hops, just dense and full roasted malts that bring to mind figs and coffee and chocolate. Really nice!
The feel is likewise smooth as silk, this is just a pleasure to drink.
Glad I finally tried this, it will be a regular in my cellar."
Imperial Stout,4.36,"12-oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass
I had been saving a bottle to review for a while. Father's Day seemed like a good occasion.

A - Samuel Smith always looks fancy, foil-wrapped bottles and all. This one pours a deep pitch black with ruby highlights under 3 fingers of thick dark tan foam, which leaves behind a very nice web of lace. Simply beautiful!

S - dark fruits, touch of chocolate, molasses sweetness, hint of lactic character; inviting

T - dark roasted malts, sweet and tart dark fruits, light sugar sweetness, wooden notes, earthy bitterness; just delicious

M - smooth medium body, moderate carbonation

O - an excellent beer all around; no complaints"
Imperial Stout,4.3,"Tasty stout, very refreshing and much smoother than you expect it to be at 7% abv. Pleasantly bitter. Drank straight from the bottle on St. Patrick's Day, like the Irish lush I am."
Imperial Stout,4.18,Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is black coffee and dark chocolate. Smooth and creamy.
Imperial Stout,3.58,"little spicy kick off the backend, like if you drank water from an ancient fountain in the forest and it was full of ancient black sludge and parasites but tasty"
Imperial Stout,3.83,"Pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of beige head. The nose has some roast along with a background hint of smoked wood. The roasted malts are present in the flavor profile as well along be with a trace of molasses.

Overall, this offering comes off as pretty mild for an impy stout."
Imperial Stout,3.71,"This is somehow mostly just a sweet boozy mess even tho its 7 percent. I poured into a tulip glass. Not much malt, oats, or chocolate just a sweet alcohol flavor encased in and M&M style malt shell....although I see this is under Russian imperial which does make more sense, I think this is firmly okay but not great for Russian Imperials. It's sweet, a little malt, a little smoke, but things like Expedition Stout or Narwhal are just better to me but this is getting more balanced as I drink just not spectacular."
Imperial Stout,4.4,"Appearance:
Lacquered black, showing glimpses of brown where the light leans into it. It’s topped with a half finger of dark beige fizz that disperses faster than squirrels before a feisty, jack russel. Despite this, it retains a length of drizzly lace until the glass is practically empty.

Bouquet:
Plump figs that were lightly sugared, then rolled in milk chocolate cocoa powder. The after-aroma is intermittent but impressively gourmet: roasted plums brushed with woodsy molasses and given a hearty dunk in black chocolate.

Feel:
A satin-soft full body, simmering with moderate carbonation. Dry, bittersweet linger.

Taste:
Dark malts and oats, browned in a drizzle of maple syrup. Finishes with a spoonful of earthy, dark chocolate pudding."
Imperial Stout,4.2,"a: nice solid black color. no light penetrating through. gives the glass a nice chill haze. 1/2 finger creamy dark tan head

s: dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses. some nice woody notes, sweet berries, cola, brown sugar and a hint of soy sauce

t: sweet smooth caramel, roasted malts, and a touch of charred wood. those dark sweet berries, sweet cola. dark chocolate and milk chocolate on the finish. classic flavor

m: lighter side of medium with medium carbonation. a bit light on the mouthfeel

T: A short hop note at the forefront, dark baking chocolate, figs, sea salt, overripe dark berries, prunes, plum, raisins, toasted malts, toffee, coffee and port wine. It is lightly sweet. All of this with a woody and pervasive mineral cast all over it. There are dark soda bread notes in the finish.
F: Medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a moderately dry medium fast finish.
O: A deliciously rich and savory Imperial Stout that has a lot of history for good reason: The famous stone Yorkshire squares. It has superior balance, excellent flavor and has never been specific to any trend. It is incredible in it's style."
Imperial Stout,4.5,"It smells so much like a typical stout that it's almost comical.  There are scents of coffee and chocolate and beery breadwater.  It's almost a stereotype in scent.

The taste follows the nose.  It's a little coffee, a little chocolate and a hole lot of beery goodness.

It's medium bodied with small amount of carbonation.  It's smooth and has a quick bitter finish with a hint of molasses.

It's really good.  It tastes like the father of stouts.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6."
Imperial Stout,4.06,"Served from the bottle in a Lagunitas mason jar.

Man, it's been waaay too long since I last dove into some Sammy Smith goodness. Let's rectify that straight away, kids. This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit of bulky stout, one that doesn't throw its heft around, rather preferring to please throughout. Good times."
Focal Banger,4.84,"Tasted from a can dated 8/4/2022. Can purchased on 8/16/22.

L- Beautiful slightly hazy golden color.

S- Very nice hop to fruitiness aroma.

T- Wonderful ripe citrus flavor balanced
with the perfect amount of pineyness.

F- Silky smooth mouthfeel with a gentle

the best of The Alchemist’s offerings!"
Focal Banger,4.57,"Canned 8/16/22. Purchased two days later at the brewery.

L: Pours a hazy deep gold with a big white head that quickly thins, except around the glass. Light, irregular lacing.

S: All kinds of citrus and floral aromas, with a touch of weedy dankness.

T: Outstanding hop character. Grapefruit up front, then melds into a delightfully tropical medley of mango, pineapple and cantaloupe. Pivots to a dry and slightly bitter finish.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Smooth on the palate. Medium carbonation.

O: The freshness of this four-day-old beer made for some incredible aromas and flavors. Extremely enjoyable."
Focal Banger,4.46,"Canned 7/26/22

Holy shit, I’ve finally found a fresh Alchemist drop nearby, and I wasn’t even actively looking. My local store managed to get some of this and Heady Topper. I got a few cans of each (HT is ready for a re-review, and I couldn’t be more psyched on it. Let’s see what this legendary beer is all about

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed

While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed

Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The Alchemist"
Focal Banger,4.96,"Would argue that this is in fact better than Heady Topper. The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more. Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin, Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops."
Focal Banger,4.55,"Look: Pale yellow and cloudy with a quick-forming head that settles to a lid and holds, leaving nice ripples of lacing clinging to the edges of the glass
Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis
Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish
Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agree"
Focal Banger,4.84,"My buddy bought me a four pack each of HT And Focal Banger. This was by far my favorite.

Pours a murky gold color with a beautiful fluffy white marshmallow head. Tremendous lacing.

The aroma is pure hop goodness. The flavor and taste on this one is out of this world outstanding. Peach and pine and grapefruit with no sweetness. A true west coast IPA.

Outside of Pliny this is my fave IPA in the world. Fantastic! Thanks Harris!!"
Focal Banger,4.28,"16oz can

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.

Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.

The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.

Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.

Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.

Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.

Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful."

The Alchemist
New England IPA
ABV: 7%
Date: 05/03/2022
I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average.
Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty.
The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy.
The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long.
An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge."
Focal Banger,4.34,"Heady Topper's little brother!!! Less alcohol presence but just as impressive!!! Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!"
Focal Banger,4.43,"Just like the OG Heady Topper, this one is a banger. NE IPA without being overly sweet. Resinous, hoppy, slightly dank. Great beer. Have to buy it every time it makes its way to my local store."
Focal Banger,4.5,"Look: nice can art :)

Smell: mostly stuck in the can

Taste: a little creamy, a little piney, a little grapefruit, good balance.

Feel: Not as ""plush"" as some more recent beers, but not thin either. Just right for the taste.

Overall: I'm not as blown away as some but it is still very, very good. Might be even better if this one was a little less cold."
Focal Banger,3.89,"Refrigerated Focal Banger 1/2 quart can poured into shell glass. Very much like Heady Topper, but with a shade less alcohol. Nice intense hop flavor and aroma, with some bitterness. I would prefer more malt body, though."
Focal Banger,4.36,"Slightly opaque, straw yellow with a low white head of fine bubbles. Aroma of citrusy hops and a bit of pine. Hoppy flavors upfront, a bit hard-edged but that’s meant in a good way. Flavors of tangerine and grapefruit pith, pine and apricot. Medium mouthfeel, finishes a little tingly, warming up the sides of the cheeks. Hop bitters linger. Is it heresy to say I like it better than HT?"
Focal Banger,4.91,"Has a nice floral, fruity aroma & hop dankness scent. Taste like a bit of melon & pineapple juice but the hop aftertaste is fantastic as it really lingers. This is a really great IPA that I will get again when I get back to Vermont. Cheers to The Alchemist!"
Focal Banger,4.17,Nice and vibrant in a two day old can. Hoppy but citrusy and nice malts.
Focal Banger,4.25,"Pours an opaque, orange color. Thick, three finger frothy head forms on the beer, lingers a moment, then dissipates leaving just a thin residual head behind. White lacing coats the glass. Aroma has notes of dank weed, some catty notes, woody hops and a lighter layer of citrus, orange, and mango.

Taste follows the nose with notes of weedy hops, dank notes, wood, and some light orange and citrus notes. There is a noticeable malt backbone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and oddly refreshing in a way.

Overall it is a nice IPA. I think I am somewhat less blown away by it than most, but it is still a very nice IPA."

O: This is a very good beer, the look and smell are top notch. I wish it had some more carb overall and I could get a bit more coffee."
I Let My Tape Rock,4.84,"L: Dark mahogany viscous pour with a sandy head and slight lacing
S: Tons of maple and vanilla on the nose
T: Robust maple slightly reigned in by the coffee, but the sweetness is magnified by a creamy vanilla caviar

I Let My Tape Rock,4.31,"Viscous almost gloppy black out of the bottle, it forms a thin dark tan film that quickly settles to a thin chain.

Significant barrel spice and heat are right up front before the thick body envelopes the palate with maple, coconut, and mocha brownies. The finish actually cleans up and even becomes somewhat crisp to a semi-dry, tingly and only slightly sticky lip smacking swallow.

The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout."
Boskeun,4.21,"Pours a hazy (I always aspirate my yeast back in), deep orange colour. Plenty of bubbles run up the side of the glass, supporting an incredibly dense head that has these big rocky bubbles at the top. Gorgeous honestly

A sweet, mild, herbal and yeasty aroma. Banana and general phenolic spices present as well.

All my last reviews have been simple, ‘taste follows the nose’, but not this one. The aforementioned aromas are present in the palate but it’s quite a complex and interesting flavour profile. First off, the ABV is present but in a complementary way. It inflects off of the delicious yeasts and drives up the spicy phenolic character quite a bit. Cloves, cinnamon on the back end… cardamom? Not sure if that’s what I’m thinking but there’s something else in there too.

Banana bread, honey, the floral notes in the aromas are transformed into more earthy tones here. Maybe this sounds strange but, apple peel? Usually I taste fruit in beers it’s just ‘apple’ or ‘pear’, rarely peel unless it’s citrus zest in hop forward beers. But I get a real apple peel flavour here.

Medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation that is fairly active, lightly tickling bubbles. Beer definitely leans to the dryer side on the finish, and despite the sweet notes that are all throughout the beer, the dryer finish brings out the bitterness that’s present in the background of this beer.

Well, if I knew this was an Easter beer I would’ve saved it for Easter, but only after I cracked it did I read it was. A beer I’ve never, ever seen in Canada nor will we likely ever, this was a special gift from a friend who brought it back from the good ol United States. It’s beautiful looking, complex and delicious. Goodness me I wish I had another one to open on Easter. Oh well, what can you do. This is Belgian goodness in a bottle. I’d honestly say I’m liking it as much as Orval, and I’ve got 5 of those in my cellar!! Hope to be able to get another one of these soon!"

Boskeun,4.19,"12oz undated can poured into a teku glass at 55° Fahrenheit 9% ABV. The beer pours opaque golden amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and island of tiny bubbles. The aroma is mild with general sweetness up front, followed by caramel, banana, and clove. The taste is semisweet pale malt with notes of honey, clove and earthy moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average plus carbonation. The finish is an enigma, being almost completely dry despite the sweetness of the beer. Perfect combination of carbonation, ABV and dryness for drinkability. Alcohol is mostly hidden, except for the warming effect on the throat and belly. Overall, excellent BSPA."
Boskeun,4.85,One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Loved every sip. Drank the 9% version and hated to swallow it!
Boskeun,4.1,"On tap at Armsby Abbey. Clear golden with an ample white head. Smells of herbal notes, earthy Belgian yeast, sweet golden malts, and some booze. Tastes fruity with herbal undertones, sweet honey, some slightly deeper maltiness, and spice and clove from the yeast. Boozy, fairly sweet, and pretty heavy. But quite tasty."

Big, fluffy white head; frothy lace.

Mulled cider, pear, green apple, banana & mild clove notes in the nose.

Earthy esters, green apple & faint caramel flavors up front; clove, mild banana & faint cinnamon notes on the finish.

Bold; fruity & earthy at the same time. Really, really good."
Boskeun,4.04,"Poured from a 12oz can (courtesy of B United container project) into a Chimay goblet. Friendly canned on sticker on pack of May 12, 2021.

A: Burnished gold/amber with 1-2 finger foamy off-white head with short retention but does leave some scraps of lacing.

S: Aroma is a bit light but mainly banana, pear, and golden apple with an interesting earthy hop note.

T: Flavor is quintessential Belgian golden ale with solid but soft pale pils maltiness and candi sugar sweetness, with plenty of apple, pear, and some banana yeast ester presence. Phenols are noticeable but low and the alcohol character is also noticeable but pleasant. Hop flavor is not readily apparent but there is clear bitterness in the background that is more noticeable in the finish. Definitely an earthy phenolic note in the finish and aftertaste. Overall, this is a sweet beer despite this bitterness.

M: Medium body with moderate-high carbonation and medium dry finish,

O: I enjoyed Boskeun but wished it had a bit more aroma and slightly more bitterness to counter the sweetness (or a bit lower sweetness). That said, a delicious and complex beer,"
Boskeun,3.63,"330 ml bottle, as DDB Boskeun Speciaal Paasbier, from Ølbutikken, Copenhagen. ABV is 10%. The glass fills completely by white foam, and the golden beer underneath appears only very slowly. Strong aroma of Belgian ale yeast, with fruity and spicy notes, also notes of white kandij sugar syrup and alcohol. Sweet flavour, with spicy, fruity and yeasty notes. The alcohol is noticeable, but not dominant. Peppery aftertaste."
Boskeun,4.25,"Bottled August 2019. Whit head. Cloudy burnt golden orange due to an unsettled bottle.

Reminds me of a tripel. Bananas, cloves, and citrus. Lots of Belgian spice. Saison like. Has some Fantome like apple skin flavors. Some plums and dates. Not quad like though. Belgian candied sugar. Very unique beer that blends a lot of styles. Bubbly like feel. I like it."
Boskeun,3.99,"Bottle from a foreign land. Three years old

Very beautiful, the bottom lees are a disgusting brown but this beer is golden and FILLED with sediment. Smells sour like green apple. Taste is tart, chewy, filled with belgian yeast flavors that run the gamut: all types of fruits and spices. Heavily carbonated, it exploded out of the bottle even with a very careful pry. Surprisingly smooth and easy to drink at 10%

Glad to try this, even if the bottle had green mold on it (!!!)"
Boskeun,4.29,"From the 330 ml bottle. Sampled July 9, 2020.

The appearance is bronze-amber with a cream colored, lasting head.

The aroma emits many Belgian Strong characters such as sweet caramel malt, a little subtle spice, pear, apple, and a lower booze profile.

Medium-full body.

A sweet yet warming character describes the flavor. I pick up more of the alcohol here."
Boskeun,4.06,"A - Dark gold with light carbonation and alot of floaties.

S - Dry citrus and sweet malt on the nose with some bubblegum.

T - Booze, light sweet malt with citrus and pine bitterness over the top.

M - Big medium body with a fruity dry finish.

O - This is a big beer and really enjoyed it!"
Boskeun,4.29,"This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like floral yeast, apple sweetness, honey, clovey spice, and pear.

This is pretty big and intense, but there's not much booziness. There's some green apple skin, pear, stone fruit, a bit floral sweetness, some spice, and light esters. There's also a bit of honey sweetness.

This is medium bodied, a touch syrupy, and pretty drinkable, especially with how well the booze is hidden.

De Dolle is definitely a top 3 brewery in Belgium. I've liked basically all of their beers."
Boskeun,4.23,"L: Slightly hazy amber color, two to three finger white head, nice lacing, good carbonation.

S: Belgian yeast, malts, some alcohol.

T: Belgian yeast, slightly malty, sweet-ish. Wow, this is excellent!

F: Full bodied, smooth. Could sip this one all day long.

O: Superb ale. Wasn't expecting much but was blown away."
Boskeun,4.07,"L- Mid gold and quite hazy (more sediment left in bottle). Pours with 1Cm snow white head. (ps 15mins later. holds up well and forms mad amounts of lacing).
S- Mild! Somehow I expect a hefty 10% beer to have a punchy smell, here all I get is some mild spice and timber notes.
T- The taste seemed to develop very slowly on my palate, give it time to linger and aerate. I get some spices, and deep/rich roasted fruit notes that remind me of British Xmas pudding in their pungency. Then there is a serious lick across the palate of it's ABV% zing. Though at 10% that's really no surprise.
F- Hefty, some meaty richness, pungent, slow-sipping beer. Great carbonation, both in the glass (masses of lacing) and the mouth.
O- This Easter bunny of a beer packs a heck of a punch, I like it, it doesn't put a foot wrong with any misplaced facets, or a lack of balance between them. Would happily buy and drink again.

Boskeun,4.21,"On tap into a tulip glass. A fairly hazy golden-amber color with a medium and long lasting white head. Orange marmalade, banana, and faint clove aroma. Taste followed. Not sweet but with an interesting rich candies fruit flavor balanced with a bigger hop presence than I’ve had in a Belgian. Almost Barleywine-like. Delicious."
Boskeun,4.48,"Cap says BTLD 2018
9% abv.
Opened on 5/16/19

Even a very slow pour produces a mountainous white foam dome. Clumpy, bubbly, sticky and seafoam style head. The active and lively yeast creates big carbonation inside the golden and amber color. Massive sticky lacing.

The nose has a very sweet, Belgian candy and fruity scent. The yeast and malt comes together we'll, as the hops have a very green-leafy and veggie thing happening. Sour banana and spices seem to pop out of the eccentric yeast.

The flavor has that unique Belgian ""sweet and sour"" thing in maximum effect. A current of sweet jams and spicy Earth coalesce into a very deep and complex flavor profile. The yeast is the big X factor for any traditional Belgian brew. This one has a very complex and interesting charechter. Sour earthy, sweet and tangy but always worth pondering due to the fact I keep finding new flavors as the session goes on.

The Effervescent, snappy, yet smooth texture and full mouth feel is spot-on and one of my favorite features of the real-deal Belgian styles.

Overall: Weird and wonderful!!"
Boskeun,4.25,"On tap at Ebenezer's (!). Very enjoyable Belgian brew, though nearly didn't notice it what with the wild conversation."
Boskeun,4.07,"Look: It pours hazy orange with small little black things floating in it.

Smell: It has moderate earthly elements with a bit of grainy sweetness and a bit of spice. There is a very faint hint of lemon and bread.

Taste: It has moderately strong earthly flavors with a candy like element. The spiciness is moderately strong with some very low bread and very low barnyard.

Feel: It has a moderately full body with a pleasant alcohol warming.

Overall, this is a very flavorful Belgian ale with very pleasant alcohol warming."
Boskeun,4.04,"Cask poured (Stout Santa Monica)
Lagery ale with deep finish. Hints of wood,smell of grapefruits. Very malty and velvety and a very easy and pleasant drink. Some citrus. A little boozy due to the high alcohol content but the warm brownness covers it nicely."
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.56,2018 vintage
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.59,"Pours black with a dark mocha colored foam atop. Head only gets to a finger or so before bubbling away. Aroma is rich roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with big swells and waves of caramel, toffee, molasses, chocolate, and coffee. Coffee is mild, but integrated well. Bourbon hits right at the finish, notching the heat up right at the end, but not enough to push it into boozy or burning territory. Flavor profile is big roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with decadent layers of toffee, chocolate, and coffee throughout. Despite leaning into the darkness, it has playful hits of sweetness. Bourbon and char add a swell of bitterness and heat at the end, but not enough to upend the balance. Mouth feel is thick. It's full, creamy, and hearty. It's viscosity suggests a much higher alcohol percentage. Overall, a hefty, hearty stout enhanced by coffee and bourbon. It's a boozy brunch beer for those seeking to lay on the couch the rest of the day.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.

Review #2500. 2018 vintage. Stored in fridge."
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,4.2,"2018 vintage, opened in 2021

Pours an oily midnight black with no head to speak of, but a lasting spider web lacing atop the liquid.

Smells of melting chocolate among toasty malts and smoky rye, together with a floral sweet, rich whipped cream impression.

Has a creamy, smooth mouthfeel, showcasing a rich and full bodied beer, together with a lower, well fitting carbonation.

Tastes of bourbon soaked, toasty coffee beans, additional char among whipped cream and lighter molasses. Has a short, sugary peak, coated up by even more whipped cream, warming spices and light coconut flakes among a flowery softness. Finishes with bitter chocolate, a pleasant currant tartness, lighter hazelnuts and a long lasting bourbon dryness, together with honey and maple syrup.

This is a great beer, featuring a gentle, well put Bourbon richness, enhanced by a smooth, versatile malt backbone."
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,3.92,2021 green peppers for days
#9,5,"I personally love this beer, I saw alot of 3.75 rating which was a shock to me. This beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason. I am currently sipping one and I'm 32 years old. I remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when I was just a kid. When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. As weird as that seems, with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times I once had when I was little growing up in the 90s. I miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years."
#9,3.74,"This beer pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head. The aroma is sweet and yeasty. Its has a pleasant, sweet, fruity taste. A good session beer."
#9,3.91,Classic indeed - early gateway beer that I drank the snot out of so many times. Ton of interesting and titillating flavors combined. Would love to revisit this one if it's still brewed.
#9,4.5,"Not heavy, refreshing, classic taste"
#9,3.75,"Poured from a 12 oz can from a variety pack. Pours bronze like with decent foamy head; rapidly recedes. The ""fruit and field"" style threw me off as it tastes more like a standard lager. Meh."
#9,3.92,"Pours golden yellow with a 1/2"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is floral, caramel, light citrus, grassy hops.

Taste is caramel, citrus, light pine.

Light to medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry finish.

Pretty decent Pale Ale. Less bitterness than an IPA."
#9,3.84,"It's a shame they are no longer at their Burlington, VT spot because I wish I could visit the once popular home to this wonderful serum. Anyways, a bronze liquid fills my glass with a foamy white head. Fairly standard appearance, but a wonderful aroma of apricot/fruity sweetness permeates the glass. A sip and you quite literally are mystified by this beer. What am I drinking? It's got a sweet flavor to it with an almost malty touch. A really crisp clean beer that is unique and hard to describe, but really what it is is delicious."
#9,5,"This is a solid beer that tastes reminded me of my first taste of home-brewed IPA: more floral fragrant with prevalent apricot notes. One of my favorite all-time recommendations, but maybe not for everyone’s palette if into heavy or bitter brews."
#9,3.42,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled 9/9/290, so 8 months old.

Faintly hazy pale amber body. No head retention, hence no lacing.

Not much of an aroma. Somewhat fruity.

On tasting, the fruit is there, with a fairly strong sour bitterness.

Mouth medium, finish sour bitterness

Overall, none too pleasant to this palate, and I dont think its age related."
#9,3.6,"Beer pours a little cloudy with a little head, and a few small particulates. Smells more like a fruity ale than an IPA (which I like). tastes pretty good in my opinion, but not as hoppy as a pale ale( perhaps that's why it says not quite pale ale on the front). It's like your average run of the mill ale, but just a bit more fruity and a light hop flavor towards the end. The carbonation is mild, not smooth like nitro brews, but relatively soft. Overall I could drink em all day and not be sick of the taste, but it would be my first choice if I was looking to only drink a beer or two after dinner. That being said if I see them in the custom six pack fridge I would be okay with adding one of these."
#9,3.27,"Nice amber color. Smooth crisp after bite. Not heavy feel, nice for after work?"
#9,4.06,"A definite rich color and apricot/fruit smell. It claims it's not quite an ale, and it feels like it needs a bit more in the hoppy department to even out the fruit flavor. With all that said, if on a hot day you need something not hoppy and not a lager, this works quite well as an evening drink after a day in the yard."
#9,3.83,"Perfectly fine, didn't realize it was a fruit and field beer"

Big Bad Baptist,4.62,"12 ounce can into an Epic snifter, poured at 50°.
Deep night black with a generous finger of dense foam.
Smell on the spin is Coffee up front, malt sweetness right behind.
Taste is roasty malt, fresh pulled espresso, rich dark cacao, sweet tobacco. The bourbon barrel is subtle, but present. Coffee is the star of this show.
Feel is smooth, decadently rich, light to medium carbonation.
Overall: Beautifully smooth coffee Stout sipper, very well-executed and balanced. One of Anerica’s Best."
Big Bad Baptist,4.43,"Pours black, gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam. Aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate. I could smell this brew all day. Taste is not as carbonated as I thought, a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present, but subdued. None of this is truly as bad as it sounds, but is noticeable. This is very pleasant and for this ABV, very drinkable. An easy to like imperial stout."
Big Bad Baptist,3.8,"Rel #101. Pours a dark, dark brown with a faint hint of red. Fully opaque in the glass, with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. Aroma is really nice. Rich chocolate dominates, while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded.

Taste is almost the opposite of the nose. No direct coffee notes, but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. There's not much in the way of sweetness, but that's not at all a bad thing. This beer is several years old, and while I can't attest to what it tastes like fresh, it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that I'm really enjoying. Full bodied and smooth going down."
Big Bad Baptist,3,Might have gotten one of the bad batches(2020 is all I remember). Had a weird sour note i couldnt shake. Got a little better as it warmed but not much. Definitely wont be buying again. Disappointing
Big Bad Baptist,4.88,This is a beautiful beer. Pours big with tan head on dark black body. Thick luscious mouthfeel with lots of dark chocolate and coffee flavors and a lingering whiskey finish. Almost chewy overall. Really enjoyed this.
Big Bad Baptist,4.22,"Attractive near black color with ample tan head. Aroma of whiskey and cocoa. Taste is whiskey barrel, cola, coffee, and char from roasted malts. I’m not sure if there is cinnamon added but I swear I detect a trace of cinnamon. Well balanced with a solid mouthfeel. Overall a very solid barrel aged coffee stout."
Big Bad Baptist,4.63,"Pours a deep black that you can't see through, nice tan colored head that laces nicely as it fades. Huge roasted malt aromas with hints of coffee and a whiskey sweetness. Tastes bigger than it smells with huge coffee and roasted malts upfront with some hints of cinnamon in the middle and a really well balanced whiskey flavoring at the end. Thick, chewy, absolutely awesome!"
Big Bad Baptist,4.04,"I did enjoy this and I'd like to try it's other variants. The whiskey wasn't very prevalent but it was there and it helps sometimes but if i want those flavors more I'd probably look elsewhere. That being said the coffee was more subtle than SOB and this was just a more well rounded brew with the roasted coffee still slightly coming forth more. I'm glad the stouts are keeping up to reputation for Epic.

Yo the other reviews are kind of wild and its making me think this is straight up hit or miss depending on the batch and they gotta sort that ish out period."
Big Bad Baptist,4.21,"22 oz bomber poured into a tulip glass at 55 degrees F. This is a 2019 vintage I believe.
L - dark with a lovely hazelnut head that hung around for the festivities
S - malt, bourbon, coffee beans
T - big and bold, flavors of malt, bourbon, coffee, no sweetness in this beer; the warmer the beer gets, the more the whiskey comes out on the back end
F - thick with minimal carbonation
O - interesting beer, seems dry and a lot of malt flavor, the bourbon is a bit understated, but it's back there"
Big Bad Baptist,4.3,"Dark dark thick back strap molasses color,whiskey, and oak right on the nose, floral hints to taste with strong whiskey finish. Light mouth feel small head dark chocolate as it warms"
Big Bad Baptist,1.3,"I absolutely do not see what attracts people to this cloying, boozy mess. It's almost medicine-like. No body, no mouthful, no nothing. Totally undrinkable. It's not often I find a beer that I don't like assuming I'm not straying out of my lane of preferred styles, but this isn't a case of ""I don't prefer it."" This is just plain awful. I spilled it down the drain."
Big Bad Baptist,4.54,"An absolutely breathtaking imperial stout. Smells and tastes like an iced mocha. It coats your entire mouth with a very pronounced chocolate creaminess. Whiskey is there, but not upfront and does not overpower. Drinks incredibly smooth for the ABV. Clearly was not spoiled like others have reported. Pretty close to perfection."
Big Bad Baptist,2.31,"5/2020 version. Aged in whiskey barrels.
12oz can. Could not finish.
Looks good.
Coffee and booze.
The more offensive taste is unsweetened bitter chocolate and/or cloying fruitiness.
And sourness.
I don’t know if it’s an infection or supposed to taste this way.
Thick mouthfeel, chaulkey presence.
Now looking back I see some other people have found this to be sour and/or offensive licorice tastes."
Big Bad Baptist,4,"Had a few months back
On-Tap (Monumental Beerworks)
10 oz. Glass

Poured into a glass a very nice dark brown/black color, with some pretty nice carbonation, with a pretty nice thick/creamy one-finger tan head, which also leaves some minimal sticky lacing behind. The nose is pretty nice, malty, hoppy, with a pretty nice touch of chocolate/toffee, coffee, vanilla, licorice, bourbon/oak notes. The taste is pretty nice, malty, hoppy, with a pretty nice touch of chocolate/toffee, coffee, with a pretty nice touch of vanilla, licorice, pretty nice bourbon/oak notes. Full Body, ABV is hidden very nicely, with a slight dry/bitter finish, a pretty nice sipper. Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer."
Big Bad Baptist,4.44,"Strong booze on the nose. Pours a deep, dark brown with appropriate chocolate brown head, which fades to a finely laced film. First taste is whisky. Lots of it. If I let it linger, effervescent on the tongue. Once it warms a bit, coffee and cacao start to shine. Finishes with a slight roasted flavor."
Big Bad Baptist,4.34,Choc-offee
Speedway Stout,4.42,"One pint can poured into tulip.

Pours bible black with one fat finger of rich brown head that leaves some spiky lace as it recedes.

Smells of bitter chocolate, cold black coffee, dark caramel, toasted oatmeal, vanilla cookies, black licorice and campfire smoke.

Tastes of coffee fudge, caramel squares, toasted pecan and hazelnut, more roasted oats, unsweetened licorice, more vanilla shortbread cookies and smoky ash.

Feels huge and thick. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes chewy.

Verdict: Vigorously recommended. A feast of a beer, perfect for watching a long movie on a chilly night."
Speedway Stout,4.42,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a large, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and coffee and chocolate, as well as lighter dark fruit and hints of licorice and tobacco. Taste is an excellent balance of roasted, caramel malt and distinct coffe and dark chocolate, as well as some dark fruit, with notes of fig and plum, and hints of licorice, tobacco and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and tobacco lingerin in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and low/medium carbonation.

This makes for a very enjoyable coffee stout with distinct, but not overdone chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes, while I suspect that a lot of the chocolate and dark fruit comes from the coffee as well as the malts. At the same time, there's a very good roasted and bitter presence to this as well, with some roasted malts and herbal hops, which is just the kind of flavor profile that I'm looking for from a beer like this. It's very well-balanced, with some lightly sweet notes from the dark fruit and caramel malt, as well as more roasted malt and bitter, herbal hops, as well as hints of licorice and tobacco. Also, the ABV is hardly noticeable here, with this drinking very smooth, with a great body and mouthfeel."
Speedway Stout,4.26,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter.

Look- Black, visible particulate at the margins, medium brown frothy head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Cocoa, coffee, roasted oats, fig.

Taste- Predominately coffee, toasted oats, slightly cocoa.

Feel- Medium body, silky, moderately bitter, slightly below average carbonation, mildly mouth coating.

Overall- Predominately coffee flavored stout that was thinner than I would have expected, but still very satisfying."
Speedway Stout,4.23,"Thin and low carbonation for this high a rating, an interesting unusual roast malt thing going on in the background."
Speedway Stout,4.5,"16 oz can, born on 12/17/21, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:
L - dark and oily with a hazelnut head that lingered around the edges
S - coffee, chocolate, roasted malt
T - dark and bitter, coffee, chocolate
F - medium mouthfeel and minimal carbonation
O - very good stout, dry and bitter with lots of flavor"
Speedway Stout,4.83,"Look: Dark black with dark brown head. Left a small amount of lacing on the glass.
Smell: Huge roasted malt, bitter coffee, dark chocolate.
Taste: Follows the nose and is actually amazing. This is my new favourite non BA stout out there. The 12% abv is completely undetectable and the coffee is subtle and just adds to the flavour of the roasted malt. The malt profile is awesome and this is one of the most impressive beers I've had in a long time. Huge roasted malt, mild bitter coffee, and mild dark chocolate complement each other so well.
Feel: Thick and full. This is a chewing beer for sure. The 12% abv works wonders for the mouthfeel.

Overall: You have to try this at least once. People either like it or love it a lot, and I'm among the latter."
Speedway Stout,4.48,"Wow, this is something special. I've been trying to get to Alesmith whenever I am in San Diego (for 10 years), and just found out they moved to Mirimar area. So I made the trip over. They have a dozen special so on tap this day and I am able to even try Bourbon Barrel Speedway Stout too! This is not a sweet beer. And I like them that way (Roasted, Toasted, and bitter). And now they have this at my local Total Wine as well. Stouts are my favorite variety, and this goes near the top. They have a taco truck that stays outside the brewpub on some days. I have no idea, but something in this beer knocks me on my a$$. Great stuff!"
Speedway Stout,4.92,"Look: Poured from a pint can - Black nova pour with light foaming. A bit of lacing on the side of this as it's glued to the glass. Can't see anything inside if it has carbonation rising to the top.
Smell: Instantly after pouring I got hints of rich chocolate, banana's, a hint of coffee, big malts. BIG.
Taste: Wow! I felt I got hints of a chocolatey banana mix along with a coffee after taste. I'm still not over how they managed to make this taste chocolatey and banana-ey at the same time.
Feel: Medium bodied - not to much carbonation. Easy sipper to drink.
Overall: I loved it! I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as it was as usually coffee stouts are medium to coffee dominant. This one doesn't seem to be the case. It seems to be the opposite bringing out the flavors of chocolate, banana (even though not listed on the bottle), malts and then the after taste of the coffee. Good job! Two thumbs way high."
Speedway Stout,4.25,"Bottled in a big bomber and purchased from Cafe Beermoth
Pours a jet black body with big thick tan head
Aroma is good filter mocha’d up
Flavour is coffee can irished up"
Speedway Stout,4.08,"The smell is good, coffee and chocolate as expected, but not as strong as I would like.
The flavor is kind of sharp, as in one or two notes overpower a little and you can’t pick up what else is going on. Taste is okay, but definitely a little bitter for me, especially the finish. The aftertaste, after the bitterness leaves, is good, with the chocolate malts and coffee coming through.
It’s a fine beer, but I was kind of expecting it to be a little better."
Speedway Stout,4.51,Pours dark chocolate with khaki head and deep notes of dark chocolate and coffee. Amazing imperial stout at 12% ABV.
Speedway Stout,4.89,"Pours black with tan brown head. Smell chocolate, coffee, roast. Not too bitter, thick, creamy, chocolate, caramel. Well balanced, fills your mouth with flavor, more as it warms. Can't taste 12%. Well done."
Speedway Stout,4.31,"Holy banana. I swear they use bananas in the brewing process. It’s a super odd beer. I prefer just the flat Guinness. I doubt I would buy this stout, it was a gift. Still, the 12% abv is great. Good sipping stout after a dinner."
Speedway Stout,3.79,"I will have this again at the temp I prefer, right now I'm forced into having it colder than it should be. Head was huge, canned in 2019, site says it ages well...I think it does actually but I really need to try at the recommended temp. Coffee and roasted malt are still pretty present though.


After having it fresh on tap I generally agree with my previous sentiment but I'm not mindblown at all and have 1000% had better or stouts I'd prefer more."
Speedway Stout,4.41,"Black body with a tan head. Decent lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and some vanilla. Taste is slightly sweet , consisting of bitter chocolate , coffee and malts up front. Slight lingering burn on the tongue. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with just the right amount of oiliness and weight. Just about perfect. An excellent stout!"
Speedway Stout,4.44,"4pk purchased Feb, 2021. Two cans cellared for about 12 months. Always refrigerated. Pours jet black. Tasting tannins, heavily roasted malts, bourbon, hops, toffee, dark fruits, figs & plums, strong black coffee, light char, brandy, chocolate, a hint of tobacco, very deep flavors and a long finish. Full flavored and coating. Incredible!! in it's style."
Ann,4.02,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights. Real smooth with good carbonation. Light citrus and orange notes with floral/herbal and woody undercurrents. To be honest, after all the hype, I was expecting a whole lot more....."
Ann,4.52,"My long time white whale, we meet at last...

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.

The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.

Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.

Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!"
Ann,4.65,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow."
Ann,4.83,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach. Taste is something else, oaked white wine, apricot, peach, light cellar notes, white grape, hay, picking up a light honey-sweetness and very light funkiness. Lighter body, carbonation holding up pretty well."
Sosus,3.66,"22oz bottle - review from notes

I've been meaning to get my hands on this one. A double IPA from one of my favorite Ipa-making breweries. And this doesn't disappoint, with massive pine and floral notes. Smells (and tastes?) like a bottle of pine-sol

great stuff"
Sosus,3.9,"A: Medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch. Sticky strands of lacing. Strong carbonation factor.

S: Really sweet sugary peaches, watermelon and guava. A bit of strawberry-lemonade. Good strength. Has a bit of juicy Gatorade flair.

T: Dry flowery hopping, citrus, and orange grind with a bready malting.

M: Bready malty consistency for mouthful.

O: Overall loved the nose, fruity and berry like, fresh, wet and Gatorade like. The flavor was a bit less impressing, less complexed and basic."
Sosus,4.14,"Review 1491

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant.

The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent.

The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches.

The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish.

The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed."
Sosus,4.65,Nice dark yellow color. Strong citrus notes and very hoppy. A lot of sediment at the bottom. Definitely a bit weird to have that much but overall a very tasty Double IPA.
Sosus,4,"Maybe it was an off can or I was just not in the right mood, but my first exposure to this last week (from Tavour) was very meh, especially compared to the other TG offerings I've had. Fortunately I have a couple more cans and will try again soon.

Bitterness was really the only thing that stood out to me."
Sosus,4.31,"pineapple indeed on the nose. Sharp pine gives way quickly to fruit and a slight, subtle sweetness that finishes dank. A depth in this beer."
Sosus,4.75,"Nice beer! Guava, pineapple, and hoppy bitterness. Good stuff!"
Sosus,4.39,"L: A pale murky yellow, with a slight greenish and warm orange tints. Two fingers of stark white sticky foam with great retention and some splotches and wide bands of lace on the glass. The lacing is really beautiful.

S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery.

T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper.

F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation.

O: I rarely call anything too bitter. This one is pushing limits. Overall I don't think it's my favorite from TG, (that might be Scorpius Morchella) but it is a really nice drink, that I hope to repeat."
Sosus,4.01,Pours cloudy amber with a bunch of floaties drifting around inside. Aroma is hoppy citrus. Taste is hop bitter with some citrus notes. Feel is a bit astringent but not unpleasant. Overall it’s an interesting hoppy DIPA.
Sosus,4.02,"Pours a semi translucent golden color with a nice egg shell colored head, which if left undisturbed turns into little cream like dollops,A noticeable amount of sediment is present. This is a very fresh beer. Smells like mild fruit loops,fresh grass ,some conifer.Taste pineapple bread like profile, the mosaic hop is definitely well showcased in a subtle malt bill, almost wanting a bit more malt. Feels medium body, finishes juicy.Overall a very good DIPA showcase beer. REVISION: 3/22/21, this beer is tasty but the amount of sediment on the bottom of a Teku glass looks about 2 Teaspoons. It sort of turns me off. Is it yeast? some hop pieces? not really sure."
Sosus,4.22,"Canned 12/24/20. Pours a moderately hazy light gold, robust 2"" egg shell head with excellent thick lacing. Nose is dank, juicy, and hempy, even nearly two months. out. Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation. I was more impressed with the aroma than the taste, but its spiciness was enjoyable."
Sosus,4.39,"The brew pours a cloudy orange with a 2 cm foam cap. The foam is fine.
The aroma is pungent. Tropical fruit is featured.
The flavor is full with mango, orange and guava. The hop bitterness is moderate, but not harsh.
The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth.
This is a very enjoyable quaff."

The head recedes to an uneven cap and leaves a web of lacing. The aroma is slightly sweet pale malt with additional notes of banana and clove. The taste is semisweet pale malt with restrained banana and clove. Mild earthy bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. No trace of the ABV in the aroma or taste. Overall, very good. Nicely balanced & dangerously drinkable at 9%"
Triple,4.25,Sheer perfection. On all levels this is a beautiful Belgium Beer. Very complex.
Triple,4.19,"Pours a hazy golden color with a tall fluffy head and a lot of lacing.

Smells and tastes of bread, bananas and spice. The sweet malt is balanced with a mild bitterness.

Medium light body with light carbonation. Smooth clean mouthfeel.

This is a very good Triple."
Triple,4.35,"Pours a golden color with a generous head and lacing
Aroma has very nice fruity and spice hints
Taste follows the nose with a nice fruity and spice flavor
A medium bodied decently carbonated beer
A good Belgian Tripel"
Triple,3.5,"De color dorado, con poco mas de un dedo espumoso de buena retención. Cuerpo ligero, de textura sedosa y carbonatación media. Aroma a levadura y afrutado. Sabor con notas florales y algo de cilantro."
Triple,4.21,"Cork says vintage is December, 2016. Enjoyed on 07/13/2021."
Triple,4.67,"Pours a slightly hazed gold with 2 fingers of billowy cream colored head. Fantastic lacing & head retention

S: Pears, yeastyness & appleskins in ample amounts

T: Follows the nose, also Golden Delicious appleskins and dryness up front. Some breadyness & rubber band as this warms along with dryness & appleskins & a little lemon. Finishes with Golden Delicious Apple, dryness & a little juicy fruit ester

MF: Medium body, fairly firm carbonation

Just a well put together Tripel, the only flaw I really found was it needed to be a little more hoppy"
Triple,4.19,"L: Cloudy orange/amber with a large, slowly dissolving off-white head that laces the sides of the glass and ends with a thick film
S: Cloves, mild banana, fresh wheat, white peasant bread
T: fresh wheat, hearty malts, some yeast, sugars, maybe some apple/peach/pear, with a subtle banana & clove background
F: MIld carbonation that cleans the tongue and leaves a mildly bitter-sweet aftertaste
O: A truly excellent beer. Not as heavy or boozy as some triples, but that is not a detriment. Val-Dieu has made a very well balanced, drinkable ale that, if not for the 9%, makes an great session sipper. Make up a plate of soft cheeses and enjoy."
Triple,3.68,"On tap at Brewhouse Gallery. Clear golden with a big white head. Smells a little sweet, fruity, a little yeast and candy. Tastes a little sweet with some bright fruitiness. Earthy yeast and some warming spices. Bitterness cuts the sweetness. Medium heavy. Not a style I drink a lot, but it's enjoyable."
Triple,4.04,"L-Pours mid-gold/lighter amber, slight haze (more accreted sediment left in bottle), 2Cm pillowy white head, still holding 10mins later.
S- Aromatic wood/timber notes.
T- Pretty much follows the Smell^, then into a pungent slightly sour+rich fruitiness (reminds me of baked cooking apples or the rich/slightly sour apple in a Brit apple crumble). It's clever, it doesn't hit you with a sense of being 9%, it's well crafted, subtle and more sophisticated than that.
F- You can tell it's pretty pungent but no one facet is really standing out from the whole and declaring itself OTT.
O- It's very drinkable indeed, and I'd be delighted to buy+drink this again.
Bought from BelgiumInABox Antwerp/BE for delivery to me in London/UK. BB: 03/10/21.
The label is entirely redesigned and it's far simpler, really pared back actually and classy looking. 330ml bottle, BB: 03/10/2021. Bought from BelgiumInABox Antwerp/BE for home delivery to me in London/UK."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.07,"From a can into a pint glass. Pour has a vibrant, slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. Scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). Taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. Feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. An all around excellent fall beer that is very, very drinkable."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,"This one I really like.

Poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didn't last that long, but overall it still looked good in the glass.

Aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype, and even the nectar part, as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction.

This one had a nice complexity between hops, malt and hazelnut. I will absolutely buy it again. It was also nice to have an English brown ale, as this style is not very common in South tx"
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.4,"First, this is a well carbonated beverage. But it doesn't produce a ridiculous amount of beer head. In fact, the lightly biege head is very modest, although somewhat enduring. The brew itself is a solid brown color that's opaque, but far from murky. The aroma is malty and the described hazelnut addition is definitely subdued. That aspect isn't even in the initial taste. But then, as the brew lingers toward its finish, the hazelnut explodes. This is a truly unique drinking experience and a good one, should you like hazelnuts. As a brown ale there's no expectation of hoppiness and this is true to that style. That this can convert a mild malt character into one with such a hazelnut infusion is admirable. This may be another limited audience brew, but it's a great choice for anyone that likes their brown ales with a hazelnut flavoring. This best part, it adds a nutty aspect without any additional sweetness."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.75,An exceptional brown ale. A must try for fans of brown ales.
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4,"Loved it. Smooth, chewy. No bitterness."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.84,"Pours a deep amber hue with a robust tan head.
Some mild hop scents. Not much aroma.
Good malty, roasty tones.low bitterness.
Nutty and I get a bit of caramel too.hazelnut is there also.
Smooth with low carbonation.
Good offering from rogue, drink with bread pudding."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,3.8,"Poured moderately hard from a can into a snifter glass, forming a couple fingers of tan head. Head soon faded to nothing. Translucent orangey-brown color. Smell is definitely hazelnut, but not super strong. Taste is some hazelnut and roasty undertones. Tasty and mild. Pretty strong carbonation and light bodied. Not bad overall, an easy drinking hazelnut porter."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.19,"Very slightly hazy mahogany brown color with a nice moderate tan head that retrains well but produces very little lacing.
The aroma is warm fresh bread, slightly sweet malt and just a hint of nuttiness.
The taste is light sweet malt, biscuits, a touch of brown sugar and nicely light hazelnut with just enough floral hops for a nicely balanced overall flavor, nothing overpowering or too understated
The body is light/medium and very smooth with mild carbonation.
Overall, just a really pleasant brown ale, very nice."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.26,"Nutty: my favorite.

L- On the pour I got a 1finger head, as I drink there is light lacing. It is a deep reddish brown and the beer is almost hazy which is interesting, hopefully normal, but kinda cool.

S- the hazelnut flavor definitely comes through and it compliments the yeast they used nicely. Not a lot of hops on the nose, but that's kinda the point.

T- A warm (feeling/tasting) malty tidal wave of flavor dissipates into a pretty subtle hazelnut flavor with very light bitterness that also reminds me of a nut, not a lot of hops again.

F- the feel is mostly consistent and overall enjoyable but if you think about it there is a slick lens that comes right before a dryness but that's quite easy to move past

O- the flavor profile carrys this beer into nut brown ale stardom, as the hops from american craft brewing remove some of the nutty qualities from this english style. Sam smith still beats them out, but this is much more accessible and attractive to modern audiences."
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,4.65,Nuts. Nuts. Nuts. Good. Better. Best. Nuts! (& a fine nectar 'tis!)
Swish,4.78,"Swish, canned 06/09/22, pours an orange, pineapple juice color with a big head and an absolutely fabulous aroma of the hops. Taste follows the nose and the taste is all hops and it's a splendid blend. The mouthfeel is very smooth, delicious and lacks bitterness. Overall one of the best juice bombs I ever had the pleasure to consume. Special Thanks to Jennifer for sharing this fantastic New England IPA."
Swish,4.93,Great IPA. Well worth the drive to Portland!
Swish,3.83,"Hazy. Fruity. Smooth. Like a bunch of tropical fruits blended and fermented.

Only issue? Maybe fermented a bit too long. Bit of an alcohol burn. Not overpowering, but there compared to some of the others on draft. Tasty, smooth enough, but my table enjoyed Here’s To Feeling Good All The Time much more, that was a damn near perfect beer."
Swish,4.69,Every sip its own little journey.
Swish,4.44,"Had on tap. Hazy darker yellow with a full white head and light lacing. Big citrus and bright tropical fruit juices with dank hops for the aroma bouquet. Taste adds a shot of honey, instead of general citrus and tropical juice, now here I get defined orange, lemon, pineapple, lychee, papaya, big peach, and grapefruit. Super juicy and refreshing feel, medium bodied and bright with a wet softness."
Swish,4.65,"An outstanding hazy NEIPA.

Appearance is light yellow, opaque, light head.

Smell is strong grapefruit, citrus, lemon, orange. Maybe just a very slight touch of dank?

Feel is a touch light, but that adds to the drinkability without being too heavy. Nice effervescence.

Taste follows the smell, forward and strong grapefruit dominates, undertones of citrus, lemon, orange. Very delicious, very drinkable. Nicely balanced without being a ‘juice bomb’ or cloyingly dank.

Overall one of (if not the overall) the best hazy NEIPA’s. You could have several of these in a row."
Swish,4.77,"Typical NE hazy yellow IPA with an orange tinge and a nice cream head.
Tropical nose of papaya, melon and pineapple with a racy grapefruit citrus note running through.
Palate follows nose very closely and the hops are nicely integrated rather than overpowering and dominating.
A really great beer."
Swish,4.44,"Not at all disappointing, Rich color, Nice Soft Bite. The nose was rewarded too"
Swish,4.46,"Pours a bright orange-yellow color. Completely opaque, somewhat thickish. Lovely three finger head forms on the beer, lingers, and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of residual foam on top of the beer. Aroma has notes of bright citrus, papaya, pineapple, with some light dank hoppy notes. Its really nice - balance of sweetness, fruit but with some bitterness.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange rind, mango, papaya and peach - sweet but not overly so. A nice bitterness on the back end cuts that sweetness down and balances it out a bit. There are some light straw notes and a certain grassiness to the beer. Feel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, somewhat drier finish.

Overall its a lovely NE style IPA and definitely worthy of the high ranking here. Its not often these days that a NE style IPA impresses me, but this one did."
The Peach,4.37,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch"
The Peach,4.94,"#129, taste like peaches as advertised. Good stuff!"
The Peach,4.5,Holy peach!!! Love peaches in sours and this one is absolutely loaded with them. Pours and smells great and it tastes like a darn peach bomb. Unbelievable sour!
The Peach,4.26,"750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass.

The beer pours a bright peach color, orange and gold hues, cloudy with a finger of fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of fresh peach, bright and lightly tart with a nice floral quality, underlying fruitiness, lightly bacterial with a nice funk, soft oak and earthiness. The flavors are great, tons of peach, juicy, fresh, bright and tart with a nice oak barrel, sweet and chewy with a nice mustiness and funkiness while a soft floral bouquet opens up as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, coating with a delicate and lively medium body that has a nice tartness and finishes with a lightly dry bite.

Verdict: A nice wild ale from de Garde. Lots of peach, bright, fresh, just a touch sweet that really demonstrates the great qualities of the peach."
Chocolate Rain,3.8,"2017 vintage

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better"
Chocolate Rain,4.57,"drinking a 2013 in 2022
Look - black and thick no real head
Smell - chocolate vanilla caramel booze
Taste - boozy chocolate vanilla caramel lots of barrel
Feel - full body very very light carb
Overall - not bad for being 9 years old"
Chocolate Rain,4.9,Tummy!
Chocolate Rain,4.71,"2013 Vintage, drank 02/05/21

Look - Black, with a brown twinge

Smell - Very strong Chocolate, tobacco, and bourbon barrel. As it warmed up, the aroma really came through

Taste - WOW, this was better than expected. Chocolate Fudge, Anise, and a heavy barrel presence. At 18%, it hides the alcohol really well. It’s there, but I’ve had 10% beers that are more boozy. Awesome after dinner sipper

Feel - A little thin, but it’s from 2013. Actually not nearly as bad as expected.

Overall - This was a pleasant surprise. Being from 2013, this beer has held up VERY well. Really smooth, bourbon barrel chocolatey stout. Enjoyed this more than it’s base Black Tuesday. Those cocoa nibs must add something special!"
Chocolate Rain,3.89,Super thin and flat.
Chocolate Rain,4.52,"2016 bottle courtesy of hefman.
L: almost pitch black but not super thick. Minimal to moderate mocha head.
S: chocolate, vanilla, bourbon.
T: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon heat, oak. Roasted malt, date/fig, brown sugar, black licorice notes.
F: medium, slight bourbon burn.
Overall: not overly complex. The biggest feat is making this 20% beast without it being a burny booze bomb, which it does very very well. I’ve had 10% beers that felt more filling and/or boozy.
This is about 4 years old and has the vanilla and cocoa so maybe that has helped even more."
Chocolate Rain,4.64,"Thank you Orca_Whale for this
750 ml bottle, 2017, poured into a tulip

A- Black with a small mocha head.

S- Figs, chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla, oak, some toffee, roasted malts.

T- Chocolate, vanilla, some toffee, bourbon, oak, figs, roasted malts, a slightly charred quality to the finish.

M- Smooth, full body, minimal heat for the ABV.

O- This is fantastic. I recently reviewed a fresh can of Black Tuesday, and I will say between the aging of this and the cocoa and vanilla additions it smooths out all the rougher edge of the Black Tuesday."
Chocolate Rain,4.26,"2016 release - consumed on November 12, 2020.
Pours a very dark brown. 1 finger off white head. For the ABV, the retention is good. The head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about. No lacing on the glass.
The nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels. I do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone.
Taste - Like the nose tons of toffee. The chocolate is really muted. I don't know if it would be stronger fresh. The chocolate and vanilla are on the backside.
Very boozy, which isn't surprising. Even aged 4 years, very ""hot"". It isn't as thick as I was expecting.
This is an interesting beer. good, but you know it's very strong, and must be slowly enjoyed."
Chocolate Rain,4.54,"Boy oh boy. You take an already infamous beer and up the ante by adding vanilla and cocoa. Gnarly. It's a beastly beer that is a true sipper if Ive ever seen one. It's rich, dark, heavy, sweet and delicious. The addition of cocoa and vanilla add flavor to a beer that, honestly, didnt really need any help but somehow serves as an upgrade. Great beer, share it with good friends, dont drive afterward."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.25,"On tap at Armsby Abbey

Inadvertent Zwanze Day pour number 2. While I’m here I might as well try a few choice Lambics, right? Another long time want of mine, moving from a red grape Lambic to a white grape Lambic feels like a natural transition. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, blue cheese, toasted oak, white wine vinegar, crabapple, brown zest, and wheat bread

Likewise in taste this has a huge funk to it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting white wine vinegar, lemon juice, straw, old leather, grapefruit zest, crabapple, wet hay, and stone. The swallow brings notes of white wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, toasted oak, apple skin, light honey, and a touch of blue cheese

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes very dry with a tart funk

Unsurprisingly, another awesome Cantillon beer. Not my favorite, but still a pleasure to try"
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,3.94,"Slightly skunky 2019 bottling. Hazy straw in the glass with a small quickly dissipating white head. Aromas (beyond the skunk) are white grape, pear, hay, barnyard funk, and a hint of dried lemon. Flavors are moderately acidic with notes of white grape, wildflower honey, and oak barrel

79/100"
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.44,"Nov '15. Great balance of sour, funk and fruit. Initial pours soft golden with mild haze, last pour very hazy. Nose really brings the white grape and culture notes. Taste starts with sour and finishes with the grape."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.27,"Bottle, at Den Tatoverede Enke, Copenhagen. Incredibly intense farmhouse aroma combined with an equally intense sour fruitiness. Intensely sour gueuze flavour, lemony as hell. Funky and lemony aftertaste."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.4,"New lable vig

Vinous and best at cellar temp."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.45,"Vintage 2018 Review:
Pours a slightly cloudy, deep golden coloration with an amber hue and a medium, frothy head that almost instantly fades to nothing. Smells of fruity yeast esters of green apple and gooseberry, as well as white grape must, and with just a hint of blue cheese funk and oak also coming through. Taste is a good balance of vibrant fruity and less pronounced spicy yeast esters, with notes of green apple, gooseberry and just a hint of white pepper, as well as a distinct white grape must presence, some oak and a strong sourness, light citric acidity and some rather subtle, musty, leathery blue cheese funk also coming through. Finishes very dry, with a strong sourness and some white grape must, oak and subtle funk lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

This kinda reminds me of St. Lamvinus in the way that the funk takes a bit of a backseat here while the grapes take the spotlight, but at the same time also lacks a bit of that depth and character that St. Lamvinus has, which is probably simply due to the grape variety though, as red grapes do tend to have a bit more richness to them than white grapes, while the latter are a bit more sour, which is also rather noticeable here, this being distinctly more dry and sour than St. Lamvinus. It really does have a rather nice, fruity and dry white wine character to it which is enhanced by the subtle funkiness, although I feel that the strong sourness is somewhat at odds with the otherwise rather subtle balance here. Overall, a nice, quite fruity lambic that is a bit too high in sourness and lacking in depth for my personal taste though. Actually, the longer I drink this, the more overly sour and one-dimensional it seems to me. Seems highly overrated to me, but maybe it's the batch, who knows. Almost tastes like it was brewed with unripe, overly sour grapes.
3.75 - 4.25 - 3.5 - 4.25 - 3.75


Vintage 2019 Review:
Pours a clear, golden amber coloration with a medium, frothy head that soon fades to a fine ring around the glass and visible carbonation. Smell is dominated by white grape, with some fruity esters of green apple and gooseberry and some oak and musty, blue cheese funk also coming through. Taste is an excellent balance of quite expressive, lightly tart white grape and additional estery fruit notes of green apple, pear and gooseberry, with perhaps just a hint of apricot and white pepper, as well a distinct oak presence, light acidity and subtle, musty, cheesy funk, with just the merest hint of white vinegar as well. Finishes semi-dry, with a light/medium tartness and some white grape, fruity esters, oak and funk lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

This kinda reminds me of St. Lamvinus in the way that the funk takes a bit of a backseat here while the grapes take the spotlight, but at the same time also lacks a bit of that depth and character that St. Lamvinus has, which is probably simply due to the grape variety though, as red grapes do tend to have a bit more richness to them than white grapes. It kind of makes up for that with a quite fresh and expressive white grape presence though, which is enhanced by the fruity and lightly spicy yeast esters, lending a rather enjoyable and refreshing white wine character to this, with the distinct oak and lighter funk notes providing a subtle complexity here. All in all, perhaps not quite as tart and funky as other Cantillon offerings, but very refreshing and fruity, with a superb, subtle balance. Comparing this to the 2018 vintage, I thought it was vastly superior and I would recommend drinking this as fresh as possible. I even thought that this had a bit more funk and oak to it, but that's probably more because that awful sourness of the 2018 vintage doesn't drown these out as much."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.33,"This pours a straw gold with thin foam. There’s a funky note that reminds me of soured milk on the back end, all wet straw and musty goat. It’s effervescent and light, with a crisp finish. Green apple, wine grape, yum. This might end up stripping my palate, dry and sour."
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,5,"Took me a long time but I’ve finally been able to score a bunch of Cantillon’s over the last year or so. Wish I had gotten them earlier because they are all so good. This one is no exception. So balanced, so good!"
Vigneronne - Muscat Grapes,4.47,"On tap at Veil Summer Fest in August. Just a real treat. Pale golden color, nose is heavy grapes, grape must, oak, and apple. Taste definitely is wine-influenced, with a deciduous fruit character and musty, but dry and crisp finish. Light-bodied, moderately carbonate, spectacularly blended and balanced."

Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.48,"12/01/21 It's aged a year and a half since my comment below and it's much more mature in taste. My only characteristic of this beer that is not improved is the mouthfeel. It's a bit on the thin side.

Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.06,"2011 vintage opened on 1/3/20. Aggressive pour yielded Low carbonation. I poured it back and forth between pint glasses to get it to breathe a bit and roused 0.5 fingers of marshmallowy-thick dark brown head with great retention. Liquid is pitch black. Very good looking. Aroma is molasses and bourbon and cocoa, some vanilla and coffee. Decent aroma. Flavor is remarkably sound after 8-9 years in the cellar and 2 house moves. Only off note is slight cardboard in the aftertaste which knocks the enjoyment down a bit. Strong beer that got a lot mellower in time and is quite enjoyable!"
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.42,"Damned fine RIS! I did some homework on this brew, decided it looked really good and it was everything I hoped it would be. Can’t wait to buy it again and would highly recommend this as one of the better RIP’s I have had."
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.17,"Bottled 1/16/15; drank 3/10/17 @ the Yarchives.

Black appearance.

A violent pour yielded a nice dark khaki head; decent lace.

Blackberry, bakers chocolate, raspberry & marshmallow notes in the nose; enticing!

Thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Blackberry & cream flavors up front; bakers chocolate notes on the finish. Faint booze heat emerged as this warmed.

The nose was incredible, but the flavor wasn't transcendent. Very good, and just shy of great..."
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.15,"Two and a half year old 12 oz bottle in a jar glass. Hardly a lick of head. Jet black Body.

Nose has a Molasses-heavy scent. Deeper notes of cinnamon and some leather tones also present more as it warms. Almost black licorice.

Taste is awesome - lots going on. Really like that it is heavy but complex - evolves throughout the pour - sweeter malts pop early and black Malts dance later.

Slick mouthfeel and i think it could stand a bit more bubbles. Maybe a product of it being an aged beer in a bottle.

Really nice - like this beer and think the classic imperial Russian stout malt profile do this beer week."
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.4,Really good
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,4.17,"355ml bottle from Brewdog.com (£4.90):
A jet black, opaque beer that's got a very fine, tan brown lacing on top but it quickly fades to a bubbly lacing around the circumference a few seconds later. The nose isn't quite as strong as you'd expect from an 11% beer but opens with dark malts, coffee & an earthy bitterness as well as some alcohol & touches of vanilla. The taste is stronger although the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden given the strength, there's plenty dark malts & a few smoked flavours with earthy hops & hints of caramel alongside some dark fruits sitting in the background. Its a full bodied beer with light carbonation & a fairly thick, smooth feel that goes down well with a pleasantly warming feel to round things off; great stuff. "

Yes, black licorice is a note that I can agree with on this beer. The 11% abv is well hidden, just a slight sting. I also agree that there is a good hop presence on the beer which I can care less for. It's a good RIS but it's not up there with the greats. Cheers! A-"
King Julius,4.74,"Not every beer is deserving of the hype it receives. This is not one of those beers. It's wow-factor off the charts in every aspect - no need for me to list my amazement in every category. If you can obtain this beer, and you generally enjoy NEIPA style, this one's a must. Near-flawless brew."
King Julius,4.6,"With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.

And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.

The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors."
King Julius,4.04,"16oz. Can served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a frothy, half-inch, off-white head. Nose expresses bright notes of Mandarin Orange and peel. Taste follows nose with a light herbal bite at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a consistent, almost assertive carbonation. Overall, very tasty but not sure it warrants the hype."
King Julius,4.81,"Canned 8/19/22. Warm yellow orange color, totally opaque hazy beer. An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way."

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.

Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best.

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow....

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!

Cheers, KC!

King Julius,4.5,"Pretty good…
Tangy, orangey smell
Pours a hazy marmalade orange color with a white filmy head
Nice juicy, citrusy taste
But really too astringent with a weird astringent aftertaste
Where is the malt? Very little hop bitterness.
There are lots better IPA’s but the popularity of TreeHouse in a big state like Massachusetts pumps up these scores"
King Julius,4.9,"Honestly I like this a lot better than original Julius. I think the higher ABV brings out more of the flavors. In particular, I like the mild creaminess that is more apparent here. At the same time, there is a strong citrus/pine presence to balance it."
King Julius,4.74,"Canned 7/18/22

After years and years of dreaming of experiencing Tree House’s offerings, a buddy of mine was kind enough to bring me home a care package on the way home from his vacation. The King is my first choice to sample.

This is a beautiful beer. It pours a thick, creamy, deep orange with a billowy white head. Smells of juicy mango and bright citrus fruits.

My first mouthful is a melange of orange, mango and tropical fruits. Even better than the taste is the thick and chewy mouthfeel. It almost drinks like a stout!

This is a fantastic beer that lives up to the hype."
King Julius,4.25,"I think this beer is great but I don’t love it. Julius is a fantastic beer, double Julius is good but not something I would go out of my way to get. Overall great beer but, not world class."
King Julius,4.47,"King Julius pours a thick, rich looking juice bomb of very orange in color and a thicker big head. Canned 06/28/22 the smell of hops and juice is quite amazing. The taste is juicy citrus. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy smooth with some slight bitterness. Overall a top NEIPA that I could enjoy on a regular basis. A Special THANKS to my friend Jennifer of Maynard for sharing this fabulous juice bomb."
King Julius,4.59,"I prefer the extra kettle hopped versions of the Julius line, but this is a big ole DIPA that deserves respect. Unmistakable TH mouthfeel, right amount of balance - refreshing citrus backbone."
King Julius,4.71,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in May 2022. There was a canned date of 05/19/22 @ 06:15:46 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank less than 1 week from purchase.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again."
King Julius,4.68,"Poured on 5/7/2022 from a 12oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 4/29/2022 into a tulip glass.

A: The beer is a hazy deep gold color, with a large white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong floral and dank hops, strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, excellent representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time."
King Julius,4.26,"Excellent semi-hazy body; peach and orange color; incredibly dense and creamy head, rocky and sticky in texture; splotchy patches of foam stick to the glass. Fresh orange aroma; soft citrus and oat tones. Well-balanced flavor; citrus and biscuit notes; moderate bitterness; moderate phenol tones. Heavy body; super smooth and creamy; low-key warmth underneath.

This is a superb beer. The looks and mouthfeel are the true highlights. That said, the smell and taste hold their own, too. Well-rounded with fantastic appearance and texture augmenting top-notch flavor and smell. Balanced, complex, intriguing depth and allure.

Pouring temperature: 50 °F; canning data: IN THE LAND OF SKUNKS, HE WHO HAS HALF A NOSE IS KING 03/17/22"
King Julius,4.54,"Glad to finally try the gold standard for NEIPAs fresh on tap at the brewery. Great all-around taste and balance of flavor. Orange and mango, bitter pine, really great malts and a pillowy feel. Really good."
King Julius,4.05,"can into glass
12 days after canning date.
Medium bubbled, frothy white head that becomes like a crumpet surface. Lots of clingy lacing, as the head slowly recedes. Really murky, even colored, medium orange, with nary any other color highlights. Sweet, malty, spiced, mango, papaya and some tangelo peel, for good measure, in the aroma. Less body than expected for a double IPA. Off-dry, mellow Mandarin orange peel, with a lightly malted foundation. Not bitey, and finishes into a mild Mandarin orange peel and whiff of malt."
75 Minute IPA,4.3,"Poured this from a bottle.
A: pours a hazy, golden body with thick, white head with nice retention and lacing
S: sweet, citrus smelling beer; slight alcohol notes

M: medium bodied and pretty smooth; nice drinking beer
D: nice feel and taste combo; solid overall"
75 Minute IPA,4,"Reminded of this beer by the How many Beers of Fame have you reviewed? post. Reviewed from memory, have probably had about a six-pack in my life. This is fine, but does not live up to the hype."
75 Minute IPA,4.1,"Clear, bright amber coloring, beautiful bone white head, lasting long, looking lovely.

Aroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.

Taste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.

I peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.

Hop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so….""A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup."" 7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little. There are many situations when 75 is just right. Bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards."""
75 Minute IPA,4.14,"12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . .
Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.
I will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction."
75 Minute IPA,3.91,"I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in LaCrosse, WI whilst there to move my daughter into school. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent was mild hop notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with smooth citrus hop presence and a tangerine finish. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer."
75 Minute IPA,3.92,"1/11/20...pours medium copper with a light ring of white foam. Oaky nose, hints of sour. Woody. Flavors if grape, oak, and maple sweetness. Heavy bitter checked in the background. Overall a balanced sweet maltiness w/ an oaky bitter. Interesting and quite good."
75 Minute IPA,4.71,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) into a Captain Lawrence muffin top pint; bottled 10/4/19.
A: Pours a hazy, orange amber color with ochre highlights, a one to two finger, orange meringue colored head, full finger retention, and foamy, sticky, and persistent lacing.
S: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit to orange, and pine in glorious balance.
T: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, but seems complex in its simplicity. Solid, but not overpowering, i.e balanced bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with very robust carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking.
O: I thought it was remarkable similar to the 90 minutes, which means in was just delicious. Incredibly well concocted and executed beer."
75 Minute IPA,2.95,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint. Purchased at Trader Joe’s.

Look: Transparent with some light chill haze. Thick white head. Color is a light caramel.

Smell: Very malt forward with a bitter floral hop bit. Like whole wheat bread. Some toffee notes. No maple to be found.

Taste: Big and malty up front. Then a huge citric and floral hop bite comes in to the body with that distinct dogfish head IPA yeast. I’m not getting any maple here either.

Feel: Too big for 7.5%. High bitterness and sweetness that do not cancel each other out. Good carbonation.

Overall: The maple isn’t there and the IPA is not good enough on its own. I feel like if the maple rich sweetness was there it would help but instead the whole equation gets thrown off with that one missing part. Just okay."
75 Minute IPA,4.22,"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery ""75 Minute IPA""
12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON 10/04/19 1347"" and sampled on 01/25/20
$2.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy golden-orange body beneath a full head of off-white foam. The head retention appears to be pretty good. The aroma is grainy/malty with just a touch of maple syrup, and citrusy, piney, and floral with what I'm guessing are Cascades and/or some other ""C hops"". Hehe, I just looked at the label and it reads ""off-centered art series FEATURING DAN STILES"" - he's a friend of mine. Moving on, the flavor is fuller than the aroma might lead you to believe but it's pretty much the same. It's grainy, bready, and a little honeyish and sweet on the front of the tongue, but the hops and maple syrup immediately step in and transform it. The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt & maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that's there. It's medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It's an interesting beer. It's pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it's completely balanced. It transitions from malty to malty & hoppy, and then finishes drier but not too bitter with just a spritz of alcohol helping out the hops. I drank that REAL quick and I certainly didn't intend to. I've got just a swig and small sip left. The only thing that's let me down ever so slightly is that the lacing wasn't better. It still scores a 4.25 out of 5 though!
Review #6,921"
75 Minute IPA,3.55,"Disappointing ipa from one of the best breweries in the USA. Smells and looks great, but tastes smoky and harsh. It does have an interesting aftertaste, but not exceptional."
Continuance Blend #1,4.62,"Poured from a bottle (b1) into a 2021 BBT glass

L: pours a very dark black brown, bare minimum head and no visible carbonation. Stains the glass somewhat, decent legs but less than I expected given style and abv

S: wow, that is a serious aroma. Big waves of raisin (more pronounced as it warms), dark chocolate truffles, and vanilla on a backbone of oak and barrel heat. Some caramel/toffee in the back as well

T: follows the nose well, chocolate notes lead nicely with raisin and vanilla not far behind. Chocolate covered raisins, some dark chocolate ganache, cream caramels. Get a nice coffee when nearly right out of the fridge, more than the nose suggested. Abv is there but never steals the show, makes itself known and nicely warming

F: low+ carb, heavy- body. Coats the mouth wonderfully, full without being overly viscous

O: a very big brew, no doubt about that. Wonderfully balanced aroma and flavor result in a nuanced beer that doesn’t pound you over the head with just one or two aspects"

IPA,4.28,"Appearance: Pours a golden amber color, with a soapy white foam head.

Aroma: After pouring, I let it sit for a minute. Very piney, sweet from the malts. Hints of pineapple and citrus.

Taste: Sweet malts up front, followed immediately by piney hops and a low to moderate bitterness. Great balance. Bitter lingers in the finish for just a bit, and then it goes clean.

Overall: This is a quality beer that stays true to the roots of real India Pale Ale. I feel like lots of care was put into brewing this, and it shows in the product. Very happy with this one."
IPA,4.67,Smooth and crisp. One of the best I’ve had. Not too hoppy and packs a punch. Great flavor with no aftertaste. I hope I can find this one in the stores.
IPA,4.28,"Where have you been my whole life? Pours copper in color, slightly darker than normal. Nose is piney and pure hops. Taste follows suit with the pine, resin, bitterness as a West Coast IPA should. Glad Alesmith is distributing to my area!"
IPA,4.13,"Looks hazy and copper-like with a creamy head.
Nose is sweet malts with hints of sweet pineapple and pine.
Taste is a flavorful ipa with grapefruit sweetness balanced by butter earthy pine, and notes that are somewhat mineral-like though too, but the longer I sip it’s almost like a medicinal (iced) tea flavor note.
Feels creamy and full-bodied, slight stickiness at the end.
I can see why this is a well-liked IPA. Glad to try it after not trying it so long, for no reason whatsoever."
IPA,4.75,"damn-near freakin perfect specimen of the OG West Coast IPA

aroma is rich, dense, earthy, and slightly sweet. pine, citrus, malt. the magic og combo

taste follows the nose; supremely balanced, with a slightly bitter finish

mouthfeel is midlevel carbonation and medium bodied; runs smooth with pillowy carbonation and finishes dry and lowkey pine bitterness

IPA,3.98,"After more than a decade, finally getting around to reviewing this one. Purchased in a 16 oz. can from John's Marketplace SW PDX.

Look: It's kind of straw-like in appearance. Almost see-through. Reminds me of a sunny San Diego day without any marine layer.

Smell is a mix of citrus (grapefruit) and piney resins. A bit of malt, the tiniest bit, is also there.

Taste: Bitter hops and added citrus bitter/sweetness. Some piney notes as well. There is malt to fill out the flavor.

Feel: Comparatively thin in the mouth. Not bad, but the malt backbone that I really like in my substantial brews isn't terribly notable.

Overall: I'd drink this almost any time. There are definitely more developed IPAs and double IPAs out there these days, but this is a classic that's still eminently enjoyable."
IPA,4.23,"Straight up west coast classic.

Pretty much perfect in all aspects and I’ll continue to buy when my bottle shop gets them in, cheers!"
IPA,4.15,"650 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 7.25%. Golden colour, only slightly hazy. Large white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, notes of pine, caramel and grapefruit. Lovely and well balanced hoppy flavour, pine needles and grapefruit again, not extreme - just very well made."
IPA,4.53,"Let it begin with a pint can poured into a clear glass liter mug. Now, there's something to look at. The ale is a cloudy but bright amber with a bit of white head and lacing. It smells like hops and some more hops and not much more. The taste is dry and hoppy, but not overly bitter. The balance with a malt backbone missing in the aroma, is there for the mouth and provides a wonderful taste and mouthfeel sensation. A remarkably good IPA."
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,4.64,I always wanted to try this one and finally found it on tap. Perfect use of cinnamon. Peppercorns balance out the sweetness in an interesting way. Wood barrel goes well with the brown sugar sweetness of dark lord. Fantastic aroma. No off flavors. Exceptional balance.

Russian River Brewing
Date: 08 May 2020
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance.

The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness.

I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.

The mouthfeel is dry and spicy.

The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish.

I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer."
Damnation,3.96,Bottled 5/27/20.
Damnation,3.03,"I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment.
It is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!"
Damnation,4.23,"Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.
The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.

Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley."
Damnation,4.18,"Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body. Head lasts indefinitely. Nose is citrusy and yeasty, lots of esters. Taste follows with an almost dry spicy finish. Reminiscent of many pale Belgian brews."
Damnation,4.56,"Another great Beer by Russian River!
*Looks: Classic-Strong Belgian ale appearance, pale amber colored, semi-opaque
*Aroma: Mild malt, pilsner, mild bread/yeasty
*Taste: This a well-made, damn good Belgian Style Ale! Honestly if this were a blind tasting, I wouldn’t know the difference alongside La Fin Du Monde, Dūvel, Chimay, Westmalle etc.
*Finish: mildly warm at 7.5% abv, easy on palate but slightly, only slightly heavy.
*Overall Verdict*: Beautiful, artistically crafted, strong Belgian Ale by Russian River. Super work of art if you like Belgian style!"
Damnation,3.86,"Has a decent head, beautiful hazy, Golden, effervescent look. Smell, a tad metallic, Typical yeast odor, not much smell at all. First touch in tongue yields mild bitter reaction, but mellows immediately. Notes of apricot, sour dough, some pine, and fruit notes. I don’t taste the spice, but feel the warmth from it. Overall, a mellow, but refreshing flavor. Mouth feel, is creamy and gentle, medium body. Overall, A good beer."
Damnation,4.21,"Pours a foggy pale orange with a fluffy three fingers of off-white foam. Head retention is great, forming a stoic layer above the beer for a long time. Aroma is pale, biscuity, wafery, crackery, earthy malts with slight resiny, herbal hops. A little clove rounds it out. Flavor profile is resiny, herbal, grassy hops that reside at the back of the tongue after the malts finish singing the chorus. Malts are biscuity, wafery, crackery and pale. A little lemon grass and clove lingers towards the finish. Mouth feel has a bubbly effervescent that somehow expands and fizzes on the tongue as it hits, growing the texture from start to swallow. Crispness creeps on towards the finish, after the initial foamy expansion on the tongue. Overall, bubbly and yet crisp with a refreshing display of malts and hops behind. Balance is great with a little playfulness.

It’s been awhile since I’ve had a Duvel to be honest but I think I might prefer it. That’s not to say this is bad, but Duvel is amazing. I’m not getting a lot on the nose. It’s dry with a bit of funk. I wouldn’t know it’s a Belgian immediately but after a couple of sips it’s apparent. A great beer but maybe better fresh?"
Damnation,4.08,"Pours a medium straw color - like an IPA. Sweet Belgian candi sugar aroma. Flavor is very typical of a Belgian, but softer from the age. Touch of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is appropriate, medium bodied. Overall an ok beer, might have aged it too long...

Finished dryly with a lingering spicy flavor. Fantastic display of Belgian esters. Mellow fruitiness balanced with spiciness and boozy warmth."
Damnation,4.06,"Pours a light yellow with a mild haze to it. Huge head formation. When it calms down it recedes to a finger of pure white foam. It persists for quite a while.

Nose is yeast funk, banana, clove, mild citrus zest, perhaps lemon. Vibrant scents jumping out of the glass. Very appealing.

Taste is denser than the nose. Richer. But similar. Some nice bitterness from the hops counteracting the touch of sweetness from the malt.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Very smooth.

Not a huge fan of the Belgian Pale Ales, but I was quite impressed with this brew. Having limited access to Russian River its hard to snag bottles, but I pick one up whenever I get the chance. I look forward to seeing the rest of their accomplishments."
Damnation,3.88,"Rating from notes. 375 ml bottle purchased by my wife at City Beer Store in San Francisco, California. Consumed January 2014. ""Bang on for the style."" 3.88/5"
Damnation,4.5,"I got one of these expensive bottles of World-Class beer from Whole Foods for $7 each. Poured into a stemless wine glass because I don't have a tulip or goblet, the recommended glassware for this style.

Look: The golden color of the body is reminiscent of unfiltered Buckwheat honey, an orange-hued amber. Super fluffy, frothy, choppy, and billowing slightly off-white head. The body is hazy and shows ample carbonation from the bottle fermentation. When the cork is popped, the bottle oozes smoke like some Harry Potter shit. The lacing drags down the glass like foamy bunting.

Smell: Right after popping the cork, I immediately get an incredibly complex aroma of toasted challah, fig, a touch of orange zest, phenolic clove, banana, delicate white pepper, and caramel. This stuff smells mouthwateringly good.

Taste/Mouthfeel: The incredibly rich bready taste has mounds of caramel, toasted challah bread, browned butter, light hop spice, earthy hops, biscuit, and sophisticated yeast-derived banana and fig flavors intertwined throughout the perfectly balanced yet still malt dominant flavor profile. The flavors explode across the palate as this liquid genius glides down the throat. The hopping perfectly balances and complements the other flavors, yielding pure earthy and slightly spicy mild bitterness to back things up. The body is overall a solid medium; hearty with enjoyable chewiness. The well-hidden alcohol is slightly warming as the beer comes up in temp, with a reassuring kiss of sultry euphoria that caresses the mind and spirit.

Overall: Incredible this beer is outstanding evidence of just how good Russian River Valley is. I loved digging my nose into the soft, smooth foam of the aromatic head and gulping down the cool liquid genius. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, with such deliciousness that each richly pleasurable drink makes you go ""mmm"" and smack your lips. This is one of the best breweries in the world. This beer is extremely delicious in every way. A fantastic example of the style, one of the best beers I have ever had."
Damnation,4.64,"The beer pours with much froth with a slight stinging sensation when tasted. Once adjusted, the warmth of the ale surrounds and it becomes another solemn moment in the mind of a monastery. Excellent!"
Zombie Dust,5,"If you see this on a menu and are ok with IPAs, and you’ve never had it…order it. It deserves the World Class it gets."
Zombie Dust,5,"When I took a swig I stroked out and saw a vision of the undead king, when I came to my underwear was wet and my tastebuds happy 5/5 I would get discombobulated again."
Zombie Dust,4.56,"Poured an opaque golden amber color into a pint glass with a off white finger high head that dissipated quickly; dainty carbonation no lacing. Aroma is hop forward with earth and malt overtone that also offer some floral notes. Taste is bitter throughout with a slightly citrusy sweet finish that lingers. Mouth is chewy and flavorful, very satisfying. A little dark and hoppy for a pale ale, but oh sooo good! In fact it was so good I had to go back to where I got it and buy the remaining 2 six packs. First time I've seen anything from 3 Floyds in my area."
Zombie Dust,2,"Typical over-priced craft beer with cartoonish label from hell. Nothing special, for sure. I'd rather drink a PBR than this piss water."
Zombie Dust,4.49,"Look: It pours amber with a white head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: Strong aromas of grapefruit and citrus. It also has some support pineapple notes.

Taste: It has grapefruit flavors with some pineapple and mango. There is a bit of sweetness in the flavor. There are low background caramel notes.

Feel: It has a medium body and good bitterness to it without being sharp.

Overall: An excellent pale ale with plenty of flavor and bitterness."
Zombie Dust,4.19,Not as biter as I thought it would. Not as bitter as bells two hearted either. Great liquid that goes down easy but still taste like an ipa. Malt and medium bitterness with a light body. Would buy again as a 6 pack for a campfire or something.
Zombie Dust,4.15,"Hazy, light amber color. Moderate bar pitted head which lasts throughout the tasting. Slippery lace leaving a minimum of streaks as the beer is consumed.

The aroma starts with a sweetness that reminds me of papaya and guava (in a word, tropical). The hop is mostly floral with a bit of black pepper thrown in.

The malt is dryer than I expected, certainly less tropical than the smell. The hop is more pronounced producing a bitter bite. The body is neutral as is the carbonation. Long bitter aftertaste."
Zombie Dust,5,This has to be the BEST IPA out there! I have tried every one I could find and this is the one that I can truly give a 5 across the board!!
Zombie Dust,3.91,"Citrus, hop, white tea, light roast coffee, texture's fine and creamy while being very refreshing and inviting. A fairly complex and balanced APA."
Zombie Dust,4.23,"12 oz can, about 2 months old

Slightly hazy golden color, thick off white head. Great head retention. Big citrus zest aroma. Taste is pretty citrusy too - orange, grapefruit. Fairly bitter finish. Medium bodied."
Zombie Dust,3.28,"Too hoppy.

A friend told me I had to try this beer. I tend to like some hoppy beers, but this one was just way too much to the point it didn't actually taste good."
Zombie Dust,4.43,"Acquired in a trade with @Turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in June 2022.

Look: Pours a burnished, bright orange, with a white, persistent head. Leaves lacing on the glass as it goes down.

Nose: Oh yeah! Big, bitter hops, clean orange citrus, caramel malt. This is a throwback to the good old days!

Taste: Even better than the nose! It has a big bitter hop burn that's awesomely bracing. Flavour wise there's a dank resinous note that gives way to clean orange and pineapple citrus. The finish is uber clean.

Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.

Overall: This is a fantastic throwback to an old-school, big, bitter, citrusy pale ale. Great beer!

Cheers!"
Zombie Dust,4.27,"Not worth the high rating in my opinion. Tasted very much like a normal IPA. Rich orange color with citrus and strong hoppy aromas. Nothing different from what I’d expect from a regular IPA. Feels and tastes of a heavy malt with a smooth finish. The smoothness clearly gives it the edge, but outside of that not a 100 rated beer. On the positive side, double thumbs up for the artwork on the can! The Zombie King coming right out of a graphic novel gets a hard 5/5, but the beer gets a slightly above average rating."
Zombie Dust,3.75,Not it
Zombie Dust,4.49,"Found this at the local beer store and they let me get just the one to sample at home.

Poured into a clear glass beer mug. Golden color with a nice white head that slowly subsides. The taste is that of a heavy malt flavor and a nice clean finish. I like it a lot and will be getting more to have around whenever someone drops by. Good job on this one."
Zombie Dust,4.43,"A rich copper orange with a big beautiful long lasting head. Canned 06/03/22 Zombie Dust reminds my nose of cold unsweetened tea. The taste follows the nose and it mimics uniced, unsweetened, strong tea and has that hint of bitterness like tea. Overall it's a good beer for a pale ale but doesn't seem as great as I've read. More to come. Will revisit. 07/19/22 Now my third of 6 Zombie Dust beers. The second one tasted much better than the first. Something was not right about it. These last two taste phenomenally better. So much smoother and doesn’t taste like uniced tea. Changed my rating to reflect that. Now has a bit of sweetness that lingers and I find that exceptional. Really good beer."
Zombie Dust,4.16,"Not as mind blowing as I had expected reading the reviews but still a solid APA, crisp with a very dry finish"
Zombie Dust,4.01,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a tulip glass.

Look- Very deep gold, moderately hazy, no visible particulate, frothy white head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Clementine, pineapple, biscuit.

Taste- Clementine, pineapple, sweet biscuit, moderately astringent.

Feel- Medium body, moderately bitter, moderately astringent, creamy, average carbonation.

Overall- A malt heavy pale ale with a pleasant nose and moderate astringency."
Zombie Dust,4.11,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Faintly rosy straw colored pour. Cream colored head of very fine foam.

S - Sweet resinous hops, mango fruitiness. Pine/grassiness as well.

T - Pine resin and orange peel.

F - Dry with an oily slickness. Very fine, champagne-like carbonation.

Very good example of the style with the signature 3-Floyds hop combination. Tastes bigger than it is [ABV]."
Zombie Dust,5,Holds up to the test of time. Poured from a can and as tasty and refreshing as my first one 10 years ago.
Zombie Dust,4.57,Incredibly smooth brew with a bit of chewiness to it. Compared to your standard pale ale this one is fantastic in it's own ways.
Cuvee De Tomme,4.34,2018 vintage at 12.5%
Cuvee De Tomme,4.47,On tap at the brewery. Incredible cherry character with added barrel qualities. Such a great sour. Rich and dark with the fruitiness that makes cherries so perfect for dark beers and aging. Been waiting 15 years to try this and it does not disappoint!
Cuvee De Tomme,4.22,"Bottle, as The Lost Abbey Cuvée de Tomme, kindly shared by gunnar. Dark ruby colour, large beige head. Unusual and very complex aroma, oaky and vinous notes, sour cherries and farmhouse. Sour flavour but not extreme, the cherries are there but not totally dominant, also oaky notes."
Cuvee De Tomme,4.42,"12.5%. Poured from 750 mL bottle into snifter.
A: Pours a murky dark ruby amber/brown hue with no head.
S: Bourbon cherries, vinous berries (cranberries, strawberries, and raspberries), a distinct wild yeast, oak, and a soft burnt caramel note.
T: Mouth-puckering tart cherries hits first, quickly followed by warming spices and vinous berries as well as soft oak tannins, subtle sweet bourbon, and hints of nutty vanilla and elusive caramel.
M: Medium body. A burst of tart fruit followed by softer sweet elements. Some warming aspects too. Lingers and matures nicely on the palate.
D: Lovely and layered! Take your time to sip, savor, and enjoy. Let this open up a bit for best experience (seems to allow the stronger tart notes to better balance with the rest of the brew)."
Cuvee De Tomme,4.5,"A: Poured into a snifter to what is essentially a black beer. Due to being essentially still there in a small off white collar around the edge of the glass
S: The beer smells of acidity and sour cherries with hints of oak and bitter dark chocolate
T: Taste is tart cherries, dark chocolate, sourness, oak, and some nice funk with a pleasant amount of sourness throughout. On the swallow there's more sour cherries, dark chocolate, oak, funk, and lingering sour cherry.
M: This beer has a moderate amount of body with a slightly slick feel on the palate. Carbonation is essentially non existent while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is a really nice beer. It has some great flavors and some excellent complexity. Not sure how old this is but I think I got it when I lived in CA which makes it at least five years old. No serious signs of oxidation or falling off so I'd say this one held up very well. Worth a try if they still make it."
Cuvee De Tomme,4.31,"2009 Vintage.
750 ml. bottle.
Vigorous pour yields a 1/8 inch fleeting head over a garnet edged brown body with no lacing as head is long gone. Nose of dried dark fruit (mostly raisins, some strawberries, and some cherries), grapes, cherries, and slight bourbon. Taste nearly mirrors nose with the raisins taking over. Wonderfully tart finish with some red wine tannins, slight red wine vinegar and finally turning to just the tiniest bit of strawberries, cherries, and raisins at the end. Whoa! Nice feel for a wild ale of this age. Overall, a wonderful experience to behold! Cheers!!"
Cuvee De Tomme,4.46,Finally got to try this one. Muddy brown pour. The scent of raisins reminds me of Golden Fruit cookies; in fact the flavors have a slight bready note before giving to raisins. A very tasty beer and one that is perfect with a bold cheese.
Cuvee De Tomme,4.44,"Tons of depth - cherries, Brett, great complexity. Drank this at Monks Cafe in Philadelphia. Some bourbon as well as raisin. Great beer and very drinkable."
Cuvee De Tomme,4.55,"I'm not really into sour beer anymore and I don't think I've had anything from Lost Abbey since the good old flat Abbey days. Saw this on tap tonight and couldn't resist giving it a shot, I'm glad I did.

Layer upon layer of depth here, all incredibly harmonious. The sour cherry/red wine vinegar notes are most prominent. They are robust and satisfying, without being puckeringly abrasive.

Some Bourbon barrel sweetness, figs/raisins, and sweet bread malts are all discernible as well. The carbonation was spot on, soft and creamy I am happy to report. ;)"
Cuvee De Tomme,4.49,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.

Really dark bodied, pouring mahogany deep brown and filling with a black walnut and almost purplish dark quality. Head creation is faint tan, almost purple as well, with a faint pencil collar. Very neat looking wild brew.

Delicious smelling tart cherries. Excellent acidity on the beer, with a touch of almost balsamic vinegar sweetness but sticks to more robust red wine like vinegar and malt but far more rich bouquet. Juicy tart cherry quality litterally smells like you can bite right into it.

Wow this is just great on the palate. Full rounded rich almost carbernet thick like wine flavors. Bursting rich cherries in the mid palate, thick malt like sourness and almost dough cherry bread licking down the back. Finishes with rich woody and splintery touches, and has no alcohol boozy quality or burn.

Drinks like an incredible delicious rich red serious wine, but is full of excellent tart beer wild greatness. Fantastic stuff, definitely will remember this one."
Cuvee De Tomme,5,"12.8.14
Words can only superficially describe the depths I plumbed with this beer."
The Mad Elf,3.93,"Procured via a proxy/trade hybrid with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022 and drunk in September 2022.

The beer is a deep copper colour in the glass with ruby highlights. The head is off-white and quickly reduces to a thin covering. There's lacing on the glass. Minimal, lazy, small-bubbled carbonation is evident.

The nose is complex. There's cherry (verging on that Dr.Pepper artificial cherry aroma), marzipan, sweet caramel malt, maybe some vanilla and cloves and a bit of cinnamon in there. Overlaying it all is a hint of alcohol. To me, it's not all that enticing and comes across as a little harsh in the cherry stakes.

The taste largely follows the nose but the cherry and sweet caramelly malt combine well together in the mouth. The cherry is quite forward, but not as harsh as it was in the nose. I don't pick up any honey but there are what I perceive as Christmas spices in the middle of the swallow At the end, there's a sweet, prolonged tanginess present that demands a further sip. Put together it all tastes really nice.

The mouthfeel is sharp, and appropriate. There's minimal carbonic prickling after the swallow but a nice alcoholic warmth settles in the stomach. I felt some numbness in my mouth while drinking this, and while that could be totally random, it was definitely there. I'm ignoring that for the sake of scoring.

Overall I would definitely go back for another one of these, notwithstanding the 11% ABV and the somewhat harsh notes in the aroma. I'm drinking this on a cold, windy day at the start of Spring and it suits the weather perfectly. Christmas Ales aren't really a thing in Australia, as Christmas can be scorching down here, and while I don't subscribe to the idea that you can't drink heavy dark beers in summer there's no denying that this would be great in the middle of winter accompanied by a fire and great company.

Cheers!"
The Mad Elf,3.52,"Good as a Belgian ale, but not quite the cherry/honey bomb that the can promised. Most prominent aroma and flavor were Belgian esters and spice."
The Mad Elf,4.37,"Handsome looking pour . Clear deep red body under a large tan head that left good lacing. Aroma delivers the promised cherries in a non subtle way, along with a good dose of honey and seasonal spices. Flavor takes off in a couple different directions. The yeasty underpinning, the pronounced fruit footprint from the cherries, the added dimension that the spices, particularly the cinnamon, provide and the soft sweetness from the honey all working together. This sampling is from the 2021 production run with a best by date of 11/2022"
The Mad Elf,3.79,"Picked up a single from The Blue Door Bottleshop 11-26-21 for $3.50. Nest by 11-4-22; consumed 3-29-22.

Beer poured crimson with a nice off white head.

Nose has hints of cherries over a very large malt base.

Taste is a large malt base infused with cherries. Hopping tries to balance things out but does not quite get there. Finishes with a touch of cinnamon and a nice warmth with each sip.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and smooth.

Overall a nice winter warmer that i would have again but cannot see seeking this out every holiday season."
The Mad Elf,4,Has a dark reddish tint to it. Smells of malt and cherries. Taste of malt and cherry aftertaste on tongue. Overall it’s a nice holiday Ale.
The Mad Elf,4.13,Christmas Holiday seasonal ale brewed by Tröegs that I get every year. Great balance in the Cherry and honey flavors.
The Mad Elf,4.23,"Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
Looks amber with a nice foamy head that lasted.
Smells malty, cherry, sweet.
Taste follows the nose nicely.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a very nice example of the style that I would definitely order again.
Cheers!"
The Mad Elf,4.01,"Read the description involving cherries, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. and heard that Troegs cut down on their supply this year due to low cherry supply- therefore I expected it to be very sweet and cherry forward. However, it comes off a typical belgian tripel. Very good, would prefer it over anything you could find in the grocery store."
The Mad Elf,4.31,"Looks really good in a pint glass with it's reddish brown hue. I am not so good with sense of smell, but the taste is very good, I get the flavor of the cherries, could not really get too much honey flavor. The 11% does hit me, but I do prefer a high ABV and I definitely appreciate this Belgian style holiday ale! I always seem happy with products from Troeg's! The one time I was actually at Hershey park, near the Troeg's brewery, but I was not able to visit the brewery. At least their fine products are available near me!"
The Mad Elf,4.19,"Love this for the Holidays. The high ABV makes it special for me. Like DFH 120, it is definitely a sipper. Surprising, it is especially good with dinner. Last 6 pack at $18. was what I expected and will buy again next year."
The Mad Elf,2.29,"Probably one of the least tasty beers I've had in my life. Sorry to say, I did not enjoy the Mad Elf and had to give the last two of the six pack to a friend... Who left it in his fridge for months and refused to drink the stuff."
The Mad Elf,4.65,"The Mad Elf has a thin, ivory head, a mostly clear, copper appearance, with fine flecks, throughout, and no lacing. The aroma is of strong brown bread crust, with faint cherry backing. The flavor is similar, with cherries showing up, as it warms. The drinker will notice low bitterness. The Mad Elf has a medium body, a somewhat chalky mouthfeel, and a semi-dry finish.

RJT"
The Mad Elf,4.35,"Not much I can add that hasn't been covered in other reviews. The cherries and honey are well-balanced against the malt and alcohol. A very satisfying brew.

Of note, a can that was a year old had a bit more sweetness and less alcohol bite, and was generally smoother. Wonderful just the same."
The Mad Elf,4.52,"Really great holiday beer. It, packs a punch, so just one with a nice heavy holiday meal is really ideal. Some fruity undertones. A really pleasant heavy hitter that needs to be respected. It was once 13%, but still packs quite a punch."
The Mad Elf,5,"I thought this would be too heavy and sweet, or have too many odd flavors, but it does not. It just tastes good and it goes down easy. It’s been a few months so I’ll have to update next year on the taste. All I know is I miss it."
The Mad Elf,4.39,"Found this at my local supermarket with a buddy of mine whilst we were studying for some finals in college. Neither of us had heard of this beer, so we thought we'd give it a try with zero expectations. They were room temperature, which was (only was) a bit concerning.

We crack open our first bottle and boy was it pure magic. Both of us agreed right then and there that this was one of the best beers either of us had tasted. Perhaps the stress of the exams with being on an empty stomach stirred up the right conditions to love this beer on that night, but my feelings towards it haven't changed.

Awesome beer, expect something very sweet and QUITE boozy"
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.86,"Had on tap at the Pour House on Market in Denver in a Sam Adam's ""curvy glass"".

On arrival a one finger fine head that dissipated to a decent covering pretty quickly. Body is a hazy golden yellow with fine but active carbonation. No lacing on this one.

Aroma is intensely lemony with a nice hit of wheat on the back.nowhere near a hefeweizen, but this is an ""American wheat beer"" so it's pretty good. Clean lemony wheat ale.

Taste follows the aroma but it is quite balanced and all the lemon flavor tastes gery natural like lemon juice. Behind that is a solid wheat malty backbone with just a hind of bitterness on the very back. The bitterness could be lemon zest or hops it's hard to tell but maybe they are working together.

The feel has an intense carbonation bite that is quickly followed by a soft and pleasant head. This is a pretty dry beer in terms of mouth feel, but the finish is medium long and quite smooth.

Overall this is a surprisingly nice wheat beer with lemon additions. The grains of paradise aren't particularly noticable but I have a hard time picking up coriander in belgian brews so maybe this is similar. Overall this is a nice summery lemony wheat beer that is nicely balanced in the malt to lemon rind, but hops are hard to specifically pick up."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.81,"Pretty light copper color, a flat wheat taste with barely a hint of citrus. Bland wheat and grass aroma without a distinct citrus scent. Not my favorite from Samuel Adams, but it is a good enough beer."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,4.1,"Nucleated Pilsner
Look: Slightly hazy yellow-gold pouring a 1.5 finger head which dissipated into a thin cap
Smell: Lemon and orange zest and lemon juice. Doughy wheat malt, and a hint of hops
Taste: Lime zest, lemon zest and wheat. Small amount of hops lingers in there. Tiny pinch of baking spice. Little to no perceivable bitterness.
Feel: Moderate carbonation and light body. Crisp and refreshing.
Overall: This is the beer that got me onto wheat beers and remains as one of my favorite beers. Really refreshing beer for hot days."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.28,"I had high hopes, but the beer is at best lack luster. I'm a home brewer and I recently tried, and liked, Blue Moon Belgian White. I made up a recipe to brew a wheat beer, inspired by Blue Moon Belgian White. So, I thought I would try other brands to see if they were less, equal, or better than the Blue Moon. The Samuel Adams beer is just OK, not close to being equal to the Blue Moon. As I type this, I am drinking a single 12 oz bottle of Shock Top Belgian White (bought to do side by side with Samuel Adams Summer Ale) and it could be a kissin' cousin to Samuel Adams Summer Ale. I do not think I could tell them apart in a blind test. I will not be buying either of these again, and will go with the light, tasty, and very refreshing Blue Moon Belgian White. Both of these beers command a premium as compared to Bud, Coors, Tecate, etc, but they don't deliver on the taste, so, why bother and pay more? They all are, after all, just beer, and are very drinkable. My first impression, when I drank the Samuel Adams Summer Ale was, ""I'm glad I only bought the six pack of bottles and not paid twice as much for the 12 pack!"""
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,4,"Poured from tap into 16 oz pint glass at Red Robin in Saratoga Springs, NY. Pours golden yellow with two inch foam. Floral and citrus notes on the nose with slight albeit refreshing citrus tastes coupled with light hops. Good and refreshing."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.59,"Slight lemon zest smell mixed with some light malt. You can taste the typical wheat beer flavor on the front but then there is this strange lemony, sour, citrus finish. I make it sound bad- it’s not bad. It’s actually very refreshing on a hot day like it was today. The grains of paradise make a decent showing in this beer and add a nice depth to it overall. I will probably be buying some more before the season ends. At 5.3% ABV, it’s easy to enjoy a few of these while grilling or sitting outside with friends. It’s not my usual choice of beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. Try a 6-pack if you haven’t already."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,2.75,Good citrus wheat ale. Not bitter at all. Freshing but very mild tasting
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.26,"This is an interesting citrus wheat beer. It's got more fruit flavor than something like a Blue Moon, but there's something odd about the smell. I think I just don't like beers that smell too fruity. Taste is better than the smell, but I'd like at least a little bit of bitterness and hop flavor. I also taste something slightly spicy, but I'm not sure what it is. Overall, just an average beer."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.06,"Even with low expectations this still disappoints. Does not resemble any other wheat beer I've had, and other large-ditro one's get it done much better. Sam's just consistently brews below-avg beer."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.88,"Look...Pale brown with some haze
Smell...citrus wheat hint of honey, hops
Taste...juice bitter explosion into a pilsener not too bitter drying finish. A beer i wish i woulda found earlier in the year.
Feel...Prickly heff carbonation off of the wheat. small amount of lacing but still present. Perfect beer with food
Overall... I am always reticent to try new beers from the Boston Beer Company as I have not bought one in 20 years? Yikes it probably has been that long!!! And this beer was given to by a friend so i will maybe have to take off the 20 year hiatus off the Sam Adams, Anyway this beer is very nice example of heff pilsener mix."
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,3.5,"12 oz. bottle poured into Imperial pint glass.
Look: Cloudy straw color, 1 finger creamy head, nice carbonation, some lacing
Smell: Malty, citrus is there but not overpowering
Taste: Medium bitterness, some hop flavor with a dry citrus finish
Feel: Good carbonation, medium body, coats the tongue well
Overall: Hits all the right notes for the style. While not necessary this would be good with a splash of lemon juice or a lemon wedge.
Pair with lighter foods, such as salads, sushi and vegetable dishes."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.25,"375 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours light reddish pink with a medium off-white head. Aroma and flavor feature ripe red raspberries, barnyard funk, oak, tannins, medium malt backbone. Not much hops, which isn't surprising given the style and 3-4 year age of the bottle. Overall I'm happy with the level of fruit - I was afraid it would have faded more. This would be interesting to try as a fresh bottle."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.27,"Capped and corked bottle courtesy of @snaotheus poured into a teku courtesy of @snaotheus

Brewers Notes: ""It has the colour of onion skin"", said a voice behind me. It was Raymond Coumans. He was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.

The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.

Pours a fizzy, fluffy pink foam cap over a dark red liquid , visible at the top are streams of carbonation , settles to a pink ring

Aroma is raspberry jam

Taste is tart raspberry jam

Fizzy mouthfeel , tart sharp finish

Good beer , thanks Ry"
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.49,"750mL bottle dated July 2019, from the brewery itself. Beautiful brett funk accented by raspberry tartness. Excellent fruit expression, still a study in balance that alternates between sour, tart, sweet, and very light traditional Belgian esters."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.58,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottles 3/8/21, making this a bout 10.5 months old.

A: Pours a beautiful rosy-pink color, very clear. Trace white head just around the rim.

S: Huge raspberry blast up front, followed by a nice funkiness of fresh hay or wet grass.

T: This beer is a touch aged at this point, but the raspberries still come through nice. Not too jammy or anything, but give a nice fruit splash. Most of the tartness is from the fermentation though. Really nice funk on this.

M: Good, medium-full body. Great drinkability. Being my first true traditional lambic, I can really appreciate the complexity and funkiness without the overt sourness you get from some puckering American sours.

O: So this is my first Cantillon experience after nearly 10 years in the game. Got lucky and saw it on a shelf. From what I gather, this is one of the most produced lambics over there and thus easier to get. So hey, I'll take it. I don't have a ton of experience with sours/lambics in general, but I do feel like I get a totally different feel from this compared to anything I've had before in the US. It doesn't hit you over the head with the sourness, but rather aims for balance and complexity and depth, and I like that a lot.

Recommendation: Even if it's your first Cantillon experience, I still recommend this beer."

Rosé De Gambrinus,4.34,"Bottled 12/11/19

Holy hell, another Cantillon as an extra in a trade! A huge shoutout to fo1ksguitar for this one, this dude is a trading legend. I’m a sucker for raspberry anything, and a raspberry lambic from Cantillon sounds like it’ll be an absolute indulgence. If Fou Foune was anything to go by, I'm sure this will be excellent as well. Let's crack it open

Pours a murky brownish maroon with 2 fingers of pink tinted white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Ok so it's much sweeter in the nose than I would've expected but that's not necessarily a negative. I'm picking up on aromas of overripe raspberry, strawberry juice, tart lemon, straw, light white pepper, crackery malt, and a touch of white wine vinegar

And it pulls a complete 180 in taste, focusing more on sharply funky flavors rather than sweet ones. This beer seems to be throwing me for a loop so far! On the front end of the sip I'm tasting white wine vinegar, green apple, overripe raspberry, straw, tart lemon, sharp oak and light bready malt. The swallow brings notes of very tart raspberry, cherry, rich blackberry, white pepper, wet hay, aged oak, and white wine vinegar

A light medium body pairs with fine tingling carbonation, resulting in a very tart and crisp beer. Somehow it finishes very dry, yet a light stickiness creeps up on the after taste

Yet another killer beer from Cantillon! Super unique and full of flavor, I will absolutely get this one again. It's such a treat"
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.59,"L: A medium brown-red color.
S: A bouquet of berry flavors.
T: An overly strong tarty cherry flavor with a dry spicy body and grassy tail finish.
F: Very strong tarty berry flavor.
O: An overly strong berry flavor with a very dry finish."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.92,"Oh wow I never reviewed this before?

For whatever reason, this is one of the relatively easy to find Cantillon beers stateside. Or, it *was*, at least. I ain't seen a single bottle on an American shelf since probably 2017 or so. This one I imported direct from Belgium.

The pour is divine. Just, otherworldly beautiful. The most inviting shade of red imaginable, gloriously filtered, sparkly, soaking and reflecting all light.

The aroma is dry and fruity, very yeast heavy with a wonderful, inviting dryness. Light must, crisp fruit. Wonderfully composed.

The flavor is, likewise, otherworldly. I don't know if I've never had the beer this fresh before, or what, but good heavens this is fantastic. The raspberry puree is crisp and clean, at first accentuated by the tart lactic yeastiness and then overcome by it, the yeast character consisting of delectable layers moving from sweet to dry to sour and back again, like some kind of fantastic stuffed pastry. The finish is perhaps its greatest asset, with quenching yeast lingering brilliantly, somehow still mingling the the fresh raspberries long after the sip has been swallowed."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4,"375 ml corked and capped green bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Clear red colour, big pink head. Intense aroma of ripe and sour raspberries. The flavour is very sour and tart, again with notes of sour raspberries. Good stuff, but requires that you like fruit lambics in the first place."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.42,"A very beautiful bright red appearance, with a beautiful pink foam.
In the smell an explosion of raspberry. And cherries. Intense tart notes, pleasant, long.
Good, good, good."
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.25,Not as much fresh raspberry as I expected but still very smooth and delicate
Rosé De Gambrinus,3.92,"Hits you off the bat with fruit, but that tart note isn’t messing around on the back end. I can see why this is one of the most respect breweries in the world. Out of all the Cantillon I’ve had though. Not in my top 10"
Rosé De Gambrinus,4.5,Funk & raspberry almost give off a cotton candy smell & taste
Insanity,4.24,"Caramel color with a 1F head. The look is the only weaker aspect of the beer. Strong oak in the aroma, very smooth MF especially for the style, and very smooth. The taste mirrors the aroma with some added fruit. An excellent Barleywine. More balanced than Bigfoot and other beers in the style."
Insanity,4.17,"Pours a nearly clear dark chestnut color with a small head and light lacing.

Smells of bourbon, oak and dark fruit.

Tastes of sweet malt, raisins, caramel and vanilla with a warm boozy finish.

Medium heavy body with very light carbonation. Lush syrupy mouthfeel.

This is one of the sweetest barleywines I have ever tasted."
Insanity,4.44,"Pours the most gorgeous brown color you’ve ever seen, a little hazy, with a light tan head that sticks around a bit. Absolutely beautiful beer. The nose is rich with caramel and toffee notes, and there’s a nice oaky aroma from the barrel - and of course, the stone fruit.

The stone fruit is the key to this, and the base beer (Blithering Idiot). I am literally salivating.

The caramel and toffee flavors are forward on the taste, as they should be, and there’s a delicious oaky flavor from the barrel, which also provides a bit of alcohol heat which fits this big beer (13.3% ABV) perfectly, but it’s that stone fruit that reels me in - the dark cherry flavor is the PERFECT complement to the aforementioned components. I could drink gallons of this.

The mouthfeel is substantial and a bit creamy. I loved the base beer, and I love this variant a smidge more."
Insanity,4.35,Very oaky barrel. Good carbonation. Balanced between American and English style to my palate.
Insanity,4.41,"Aggressive pour yields more head (with more staying power) than anticipated. A pretty solid ring of lace forms as it slowly recedes. Body is a murky doo doo water brown. The label says that this was aged in ""oak barrels"", but it's pretty clear from the smell wafting into my nostrils that those barrels once contained whisky. And so, too, does this beer. Lots of it. Not picking up the usual ""barrel char"" notes that these bourbon barrel aged beers often lend; this is just neat, straight-up whisky. The base beer offers up some caramel notes and bitter hops and I'm getting rather excited that this is a proper barleywine and not just a triple IPA. *sips* Oh, it is! Malty sweet caramel up front with drying whisky to balance things on the back end. Very, very nice. Soft, ""Sugar Daddy"" caramel lingers on the palette. Pretty well full-bodied with proper ""chew"". Mild bittering. I really like this one. It's a little cold (left it in the fridge overnight), but I'm going to sip slowly and let it warm to see if it opens up any hidden complexities. Something tells me it will."
Insanity,4.38,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle of undetermined date (WTF Weyerbacher?) into a Lost Abbey long stemmed tulip. Thick off white head over a clear brownish ruby color. Smell was muted at cellar temperature but eventually warmed up and reflected malty dark fruit notes and brown sugar. Taste reflected the smell but more immediate and intense. Mouthfeel was deceivingly light for an ale of this heft.

For some reason (again WTF Weyerbacher with no data on the bottle) I was expecting this to be an American style barleywine, not having access to BA at the bottle shop (or being too lazy to look it up), so only bought a single. It's still not nearly as complex as JW Lee's Harvest Ale or Thomas Hardy, but perhaps aging can help that. Maybe not but this is too good not to experiment with."
Insanity,4.85,"Excellent beer. If you are a fan of bourbon, you will enjoy the added whiskey dimension. Smooth, little sweet but excellent."
Insanity,4.15,"Bottles 11/16/15.

From a 12 oz. bottle into a snulip, this beer pours out a very deep caramel in color and has some murk to it. A few floaties. It forms a pinky width of tan colored crown that settles into a ring attached to the glass and a small island.

Nose of dark fruit; big raisins, dates and plums mixing with a caramel sweetness.

The taste avoids such a strong presence of the dark fruit and leans on the sweetness side of things; caramel, dark sweet bread.

It coats the mouth with that sticky sweetness. Would never guess over 13%. No burn whatsoever, but a nice lingering warmth in the chest. Mild carbonation that I would guess has mellowed over the years, but I love where it’s at.

Overall,"
Insanity,4.06,"5 oz pour on tap. Pours a light rusty red with an off-white head. Fairly sweet with low-to-moderate bitterness with flavors of toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and caramel."
Insanity,3.19,"Powerful ale, but just a bit off in all aspects I enjoy. Had the classic Barleywine aftertaste, which I can do without."
Insanity,1.87,Far too sweet and overall yucky.
Insanity,4.44,"Pours a ruby brown with a one finger tan head that dissipated to a thin film. Light lacing is present. Nose is bourbon, malt and dark dried fruit. Taste is brown sugar, malt, caramel, bourbon. A bit of cinnamon with the malt finish adds some bitterness. The moderate body and low carbonation is smooth and silky . . . caressing the tongue and leaving your taste buds in a drunken pleasant stupor. Weyerbacher rocks this one!"
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.41,"L - 1/2 finger mocha head dissolves quickly, leaving behind a cola-black body.

S - maple syrup, vanilla, bacon, chocolate chip cookies. Smells like the best breakfast ever.

T - maple-spiked cold-brew coffee. Bacon bits, tons of vanilla, smoke, liquid chocolate, anise. Low bitterness. Moderate sweetness. Low booziness.

F - medium-full body with lower carb.

O - breakfast in a glass (er, mug)."

Bottle to snifter. Thanks DC for sharing.

LOOK: jet black, medium creamy beige head, excellent retention with creamy lacing.
AROMA: bacon first, then maple takes over. Roasted malt and coffee sneak in in patches. Smells like breakfast as Jen says. Just fantastic.
TASTE: maple and coffee on the forefront, nice sweet and savory mix.
FEEL: Silky smooth, hint of astringency in finish.

Wow. Very impressed with this all around, especially the aroma.

Must seek out more as well as the other similar variants.

**"
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.58,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights at 56 degrees; thick tan foam of mixed bubbles; solid ring, long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.46,"Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background. Tastes of maple syrup, coffee, molasses, toast, bacon, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.5,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle."
Wide Awake It's Morning,4.29,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown covering nearly all of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of coffee, maple syrup, and bacon fat. I’m tasting maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, and smoky bacon fat. The dark chocolate and coffee really linger after the swallow. The mouth is oily, viscous, and lightly sticky and chewy."
Porter,3.68,Draught pint at The Brass Tap here in Baltimore
Porter,3.83,"Oxblood with a thin ribbon of off white foam; cocoa powder, brown bread, and salted peanuts on the nose; salted caramel, brown toast, hazelnuts, chicory coffee, kola nut + slight licorice, light twiggy hopping to end; light, clean, salty, tightening bitterness.

3.75 3.75 3.75 4 4

Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old.
Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts.
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout.
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.

A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile.

Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout."
Porter,3.89,"12 oz. bottle dated 6/18/20

Clear, translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head. Full head and lacing.
Roast malt, gingerbread, earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle.
Nutty sweet roast malt, light hop kick, light char, coffee flavors, deepening as the glass warms. A yeast flavor that I seem to experience in a number of Sierra Nevada beers.
Light hop bitterness, medium feel, lasting carbonation
Substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % ABV ale. Very pleasant."
Porter,3.71,"Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more."
Porter,3.47,"Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.

It’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything. I would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors."
Porter,4,"Pours dark with a coffee note to it. Little head with a little light that gets through. Chocolate, coffee flavors upfront, sweet finish."
Porter,3.21,"Had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up. The look was different, the carbonation was different, the taste was bland in comparison. Not as good as I remembered."
Porter,4.1,"Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing
Aroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness
Taste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes
Overall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. A classic and delicious to boot"
Porter,3.2,"A - Normal pour into chalice producing a dark colored, translucent brew sporting a small 1/8"" inch quickly dissipating head. Low carbonation. Some lacing.

S - Yeast, malt, dark chocolate, and coffee notes. Licorice.

T - Coffee, cream, lactose, some chocolate notes. The aftertaste tends to linger and has an abrasive lactose quality.

M - Thin, relatively clean, somewhat refreshing.

D - This brew has many of the qualities of a milk stout without the robust body. All in all, this is not a bad brew. However, as far as styles are concerned, I feel this brew is a little mixed up."
Porter,4,One of the best porters I’ve had. It’s rich and thick and not too sweet. It encroaches stout territory.
Porter,4.09,"A truly pleasant classic right here.
Surprisingly dark black beer with a moderate off white head. Smells vaguely sweet and grainy with a touch of coffee and a touch of cola.
Taste follows with a sweet rich maltiness and a bit of cola on the edge.
Light and pleasant on the palate.
A wonderfully flavorful brew and a simple joy to drink"
Porter,3.94,"Expectedly dark. Quickly dissipating head, no lacing. Aromas of coffee & chocolate. Taste is not as robust as most other porters, mildly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth. Aftertaste slightly bitter. This would be a non offensive Porter for those wishing to explore this style."
Porter,3.78,"Quiet good porter beer. A little bit overrated, like most Sierra Nevada beers."
Porter,3.27,"Not boozy.

Almost syrupy but not strong.

Good with a meal or food but not necessarily a stand alone beer.
Body is neither weak nor strong; aftertaste much the same.

Mediocre but not bad."
Porter,4.03,"Had this on draft 11/15/19 @ the Beer Temple.

A bit hoppy, but overall a well-crafted take on a classic style. Definitely a true American porter...I'd prefer it a bit maltier but this was very enjoyable."
Porter,3.79,Not a typical porter. Pours dark. Odd smell. A very mild clean body. Slight roasted malt finish. Smooth. The malt could be more pronounced. It's good but not typical for the style.
Porter,3.85,"I consume my share of porters in the fall and winter and this one is pretty good, though it lacks greatness. One flaw is that it is a little thin mouthfeel for a porter. The taste is solid, but the roasted malt is not as prominent as it is in some other porters that I prefer. It's solid, but I can usually do better in the style."
Porter,3.79,Pours up beautifully dark with a thick two-finger tan collar. Nice balance between malt and hops--tastes similar to Sierra Nevada Stout--just slightly less hops coming through. Overall very good.
Fuzzy,4.42,"Appearance - The beer was the color of a peach. It was orange with red hues toward the center.

Smell - The beer smelled like sour peaches. There was an undercurrent of sweetness, like vanilla.

Taste - The profile was quite acidic, like a soured peach. Notes of peach and peach skin were detected. There seemed of be the presence of vanilla sweetness as well. The profile had a nice sour peach finish.

Mouthfeel - The body had little carbonation, but a pleasant smoothness.

Overall - This is a sour that I can enjoy, and I am not a sour guy."
Fuzzy,4.57,"This was a guest beer on tap during the 2021 Zwanze Day celebration I attended.
2020 Fuzzy, at a year’s age.

Loved the nose on this. Stone fruit in season, white peach and a hint of funk. It’s tart, without being overly sour, with a nuanced finish. More of the peach notes, leaving the palate tingling. Fantastic."
Fuzzy,4.15,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition"
Fuzzy,4.43,"Look - Great clear golden color with a slight white skimming
Smell - nice slight peach wild ale smell
Taste - Fantastic peach easy going slight tart
Feel - Crisp with a medium body
Overall - just fantastic"
Fuzzy,4.8,Excelent beer
Fuzzy,4.38,Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy pale yellow pour with a white head. Sour peach aromas. Big tart/sour notes with peach highlights. Lemon zest and citrus lowlights. Good body and mouthfeel.
Fuzzy,4.5,Blend 4. Delicious and well balanced lambic style fruited Wild Ale with Loads of peach and stone fruit flavors. Nice and tart but not overwhelming. Love this beer.
Fuzzy,4.22,"Bottle @ Perennial. Hazy golden pour with a tall white head. Super fresh, juicy peach nose. Hints of lemon juice and green apple. Some light oak and white wine as well. The peach flavor is great, but the lactic sourness is just too aggressive to be a supremely crushable beer. A nice juicy fruit sort of tropical character and some nice grass and damp wood funk."
Fuzzy,4.84,Such incredible depth & balance.
Fuzzy,4.48,"375mL bottle into a Teku
Blend 4 (aka Vintage 2020)

A: Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months. Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom. Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat. It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque. Certainly not much of a looker.

S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out.

T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic.

M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.

O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week.

Happy New Year BA’s!

Fuzzy,4.32,"Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful.

wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ... I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style. As I finished the bottle I thought well this was good but I would have been fine with 8oz, which is something I have never said after drinking a 375mL of world class fruited mixed ferm."
Fuzzy,5,"It’s good, not too tart. Worth trying if you can find easily. Def a great sour and well balanced."
Fuzzy,4.39,"Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy

Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25

Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.

Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.

Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point."
Fuzzy,4.36,"Bottle courtesy of jeffreed61.

L: hazy tangerine juice. Slight carbonation in the glass, which funny because it wouldn’t stop overflowing out the cap for 10 minutes.
S: Peaches, tart, funk.
T: peachy goodness. A little funk. A little sweet. A lot of sour. Almost like sour candy. Some notes of lime, vanilla, oak, barn.
F: slick and dry. Mouth puckering.

Terrible,4.2,"Look: It pours dark brown with a light brown colored head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: It has a strong fruity aroma up front with plums and prunes. There are some perfumy and rose like nots with very low spice.

Taste: It has strong fruitness in the flavor with plums and prunes. The fruity impression makes it sweet overall. There are some caramel notes with rose like and wine like qualities.

Feel: It has a medium full body with strong, but pleasant alcohol warming.

Overall, strong alcohol and complex flavors makes this a wonderful, yes strong beer."
Terrible,4.51,great malty quad - fulll of flavor
Terrible,3.75,"750ml corked and caged - 2004 vintage, best by 8-8-07. Opened 2-26-22.
Small pop upon uncorking and pours with a thin beige head...good signs. Head fades to a ring quickly. Dark brown beer with good clarity at the bottom against the light. Mild vinous nose of dark fruit, wet wood, and dusty chocolate. Still a muted spicy character perceptible. Some light oxidation that fades away, cola flavor, slick fruit, light medicinal note. Medium body, silky mouthfeel, and low carbonation. Lingering heat in a sweet finish. The beer has held up well, can't suggest sitting on it this long, but it was a cool experience to open up an 18-year-old bottle today."
Terrible,4.25,"This was a very good beer, but elite, primarily because it lacked full body"
Terrible,3.95,"Very malty, dark fruits, yeasty and very carbonated. Deep rich flavors that coat the entire palette. This beer is a bit tough to figure out. Take a stout and throw in a wild or farmhouse ale. I would have liked less carbonation as I think the flavors can stand on their own and the carbonation takes away from that. Still an enjoyable beer and not one you are going to run into very often. Definitely tastes better as you let it warm."
Terrible,4.35,"Look: Pitch black. A thick, creamy tan 2-finger head with good retention.

Smell: Bananas, funky spices, yeast, brown bread.

Taste: Bold, slightly sweet, a bit spicy. Distinct Belgian yeast flavor. No real alcohol taste.

Mouthfeel: Extremely high, almost painful carbonation. Slightly thick feel.

Overall: A delicious quad only marred by overcarbonation."
Terrible,4.49,"750mL bottle into a snifter

I’m not sure which year this was bottled. Best By date is 6/18/25 so I assume this may be a 2020 beer, although most Unibroue beers are labeled Letter-2DigitDay-last digit of year, and the cork says I019 so perhaps it has a 6 year best by with a IO19 like their small formats which are labeled month (letter I would be Sept 01 2019), or maybe it’s a 10/19 as in Oct 2019. Regardless it’s somewhere between 11 and 20 months.

Pours essentially black, dark enough to be opaque, with a large dense light khaki colored head with good retention. Definitely looks more like a stout in the glass than a Quad, but is still a very nice looking beer. Aromas is a mix of yeast and big dark fruits up front, with a more subtle spice on the finish. Raisin, figs, and black cherry. A big caramel and subtle candies sugar. Sweet bread and a bit of cracked white pepper. Just a ton going on on the nose. Taste follows except the spice is up front and more pronounced. Dark fruits are more subtle than the nose, and there’s a huge doughy yeast component. Dark fruits are mostly fig/dates,
caramel and candied sugar comes out as it warms. There is a moderately strong fruity esters quality perhaps even a touch of banana. Mouthfeel has that fantastic combo of full bodied yet highly carbonated and smooth, the trifecta that appears to only be present in really well done Belgian dark strong styles. I’m not sure the ABV but it’s completely unnoticeable and is very drinkable. Overall, this is a gem of a beer. Cant believe I’ve never rated this beer. It may sound ridiculous to say this about a brewery with multiple beers on the Beer of Fame list including the #1 overall rating of a highly done style like Tripel, but is Unibroue one of the most under appreciated breweries in the entire craft scene? Incredible consistency, several absolute home runs, and some of the most widely available elite beers on the planet. Yet it seems that I almost never see or hear people talking about them on BA. Perhaps their ease of availability produces some type of weird anti-hype. Regardless, this beer is excellent and is well deserving of its place on the Beers of Fame list.

Terrible,4.16,"Poured a dark mahogany with a thick light tan head.

Tastes of Belgium yeast and malt with some brown sugar. There is spice mixed in with pear and fig in the finish and almost no bitterness."
Terrible,3.44,"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. ABV was 10.5%. Dark brown colour. Moderately malty aroma, notes of brown bread and spices. Malty and moderately sweet flavour, some vinous notes, well rounded, moderate spices and oak, low bitterness."
Terrible,4.34,"Deep mahogany hue with a large beige head and little lacing. Arresting array of aromas, from the trademark Unibroue yeastiness, to the dark fruit and the dessert wine qualities. More dark fruit greets the taste buds, along with toffee, licorice, seasonal spices, chocolate - all adding to the complexity. Surprisingly, not too thick on the palate, with lively carbonation. Full-to-medium bodied mouthfeel; warms the gut before the buzz sets in. Long lasting, enduring finish."
Terrible,4.14,"Bottle. Khaki head. Lace. Caramel dark brown.

Molasses, Belgium candied syrup, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, red apple skins, pears. True to style. Full bodied. Smooth. Maybe a tad too much carbonation."
Terrible,4.21,"Poured from a bottle - very dark with short khaki head leaving scattered bubbly lacing. Nose is sweet dark fruit on the funky side. Taste is malty with some yeast, spice and dark fruit that tends to lean sweet. Finishes with moderate carbonation and a slight funk, ABV well hidden. Quite tasty."
Terrible,4.03,"Very dark but apparently ""clear"" brew with abundant fine-grained foam in the Chimay chalice. Sudsy and lush on the tongue. While this is seriously malty the Belgian yeast sucks the sweetness out of the finish. Or something like that. In any case it's very dry after that sweet splash on the lips.

It tastes hot going down the gullet but doesn't really taste of alcohol with so much going on. Dark malt with hints of raisins, ginger, fruitcake, and a licorice aftertaste. But overall it's the Belgian yeast.

I would say as a Quad this is pretty much a measuring stick. It's got all the flavors, eye-opening Belgian character, and is highly drinkable due to the dry finish. So many Quads are sugary death traps. From the 750 ml bottle purchased in the far West."
Terrible,4.1,"Opaque black or very dark brown color. Poured a short head of mixed size bubbles which quickly dropped down to a skiff of tiny bubbles being refreshed with a high flow of new bubbles rising from below. The head was very noisy as bubbles were popping. Left large patches of lacing.

Fruity and funky smells. Light aroma of caramelized dark malt. Generally sweet smelling. Swirling the glass kicked up more fruit (stonefruit like peaches?), added a light mint, and a very faint barnyard. This is lighter smelling than I expected.

Hard to taste anything until the foam dies down a bit, then there is a strong dark caramel and gingerbread malt that is mildly sweet. Plum and light spice flavors. Strong alcohol flavor that comes across as more spice after a while. Mild bitters. The aftertaste kicks up the bitters and a malt that is just short of being burned. Slight touch of soy sauce. The alcohol reasserts itself in the aftertaste.

Explodes into medium bubbled foam which actually blocks a lot of the flavor at first. The foam quickly drops down to mostly fluid. Bit of an alcohol burn. Medium-heavy body.

Surprisingly light smell and initial flavor. The flavor really doesn't fully present until the carbonation has died off. I've had beers with higher alcohol levels and not really noticed it, but this one pushes the alcohol as a major flavor component. Oddly the alcohol tastes far stronger than most fortified wines. Purchased in a mix pack. No idea what vintage it might be."
Terrible,4.48,Checks all the boxes for the Quads I like.
Terrible,4.24,"750 ml bottle into a goblet. Best by 2/14/22, had 4/25/20.

Pours a dark ruby brown, semi opaque, with a half inch foamy head and light, soapy lacing. Aromas of purple grapes, malt, toffee, Candi sugar, cloves, other spices, some strawberries, light Belgian yeast, light wine. The flavor is similar- purple grapes, malt, Candi sugar, cloves, other spices, some plums, light strawberries, light wine. Smooth, a solid medium to full body, well carbonated.

Solid from top to bottom. A classic rendition of the style that leans to grapes instead of dark fruit. Very enjoyable and well worth a purchase.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.75,"Vitus pours a cloudy but rich looking brew and lacks any head. The aroma is rich with fruity. Apple, pear but not the banana. The taste is awesome and is sweet and fruit forward. The mouthfeel is glorious because of its sweetness. Overall a super double throw down of a weizenbock. #2 must try #1"
Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.58,"Wow! Wanted the Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen. Storekeep reccomended the Vitus. Glad he did. Great looking, great smell, great taste, no aftertaste, wife (who likes a good Hefeweizen) was very pleased. Checked all the boxes at a high level."

Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.98,"Hazy straw color, big white head, lacy; Rich interesting flavor, unique, sweetish; Mouthfeel is okay but not special, This beer seems off the mainstream, what an unusual flavor."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.96,"Appearance: Pours a slightly clouded (80% clarity) medium golden color with a sizable white head that lingers. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas upfront of bready malts, citrus, bread spice, banana, juicyfruit bubblegum, and more Belgian spices. Definite German aromas. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread, banana, bread spice and yeast. More banana than the nose. Some Belgian spices including cloves and bubblegum to support. Sweet banana bread lingers off the finish with maybe hints of darker fruit, but they are not pronounced. (3.75)

Feel: Medium to larger bodied. Strong carbonation as expected. A malty, but balanced, clean finish from the yeast and carbonation. However the booze is slightly detectable off the end. (4.00)

Overall: My first at the Weizenbock style. This one drinks very well. Nice banana bread, bread spice, bubblegum flavors. Sort of like a Hefeweizen with a bit more citrus and fruity characteristics. Don't get too much dark fruit, but probably buried by the bready flavors. Only criticism is the booze is slightly detectable. I think this one could drink even better cut down 1-2% in ABV. Nevertheless, my first impression at this one is pretty good. (Rating:"
Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.49,"500ml (16.9 ounce) bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.

T---Lovely, complex flavors abound. Banana, clove, apricot, yeastiness. A flavor palate to easily compare to Belgians.

F---Full bodied. Lightly creamy.

O---Flat out excellent. I'm glad I went for the splurge."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.99,"500ml bottle, no obvious bottle date, 0062 stamped on the reverse label, poured into a 16oz tumbler glass.

The beer pours a golden straw color, honey hues, cloudy with two fingers of bubbly white head that dissipates quickly yielding a thin film around the circumference of the glass and a few spots of lacing. The aroma is very pleasant, big clove and banana yeast, bubblegum, citrus, spice, wheat, and a bit of booze. The flavors are very good, lots of stone fruits, clove, spice, bubblegum, wheat, fusel alcohol, wildflower and some lingering straw earthiness. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy, lively medium, body that finishes easily but with a dry warmth from the booze.

Verdict: A nice Weizenbock from Weihenstephaner. Big, bold flavors, very distinct and dynamic that makes for a great session albeit a little boozy."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.55,"Nucleated Tulip

Taste: First I get is the yeast, some citrus and then malty notes. Typical wheat notes come through, but there are strong yeast funk notes. No real alcohol on the palate.
Feel: Moderate carbonation with a moderate mouth feel which is smooth on the tongue. Semi-crisp
Overall: Its alright. Probably my least favorite from Weihenstephaner."

F: Very smooth & creamy, slightly thick, medium light bodied mouthfeel that is gently sticky, wet and has a medium fast finish. Gently crisp then smooth & flat.
O: A wholesome, sumptuous and refined beer with positive attributes in every way. Fruity, soft and bready with a light enough body that the 7.7% ABV essentially disappears. It is world-class in it's style and it simply one of the best tasting beers I've ever had."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,5,"I have been drinking American craft beer for about 15 years now, and I was always impressed how great American hops and malts were. I didn't know what I was missing with German beer. Absolutely world-class brew poured into a pint glass at 52F.
Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a white head that dwindles down to a ring around the glass that persists.
Smells of wheat, banana, divinity with nuts bordering on marshmallow.
Taste follows the smell; it's sweet, but it's not syrupy. If this beer does contain hops, they are so well blended that it's indistinguishable on the front end. Possibly a tiny bitter hit in the aftertaste.
Fantastically well blended and carbonated. Velvety smooth with a medium body makes it very easy to drink. Alcohol is quite unnoticeable.
I can see why Weihenstephaner has top ranking brews in at least two categories, as their beer is world-class AMAZING! Overall, I would be shorting them if I didn't give it a full 5 across the board."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.34,Very nice on a late spring evening on the patio.
Weihenstephaner Vitus,3.64,"Pours a murky straw color with slightly less than a finger of head. The nose is yeasty and has some citrus notes. It also has something sweet that is hard to place. The flavor has herbal qualities and the same indistinct sweetness as the nose. The body is fairly hearty.

I know that weizenbocks can vary considerably but this offering is not what comes to my mind when I think about this style."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.12,"0.33 L bottle
Bottle Date: 9201 (26 May, 2021 ?)
Glass: Tulip
Pouring Temp: 44 F

Look:
Opaque golden yellow with a creamy white head that fills the space in the glass not filled with liquid. The head slowly collapses to a consistent cover. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Citrus fruits. Ripe banana. Honeysuckle. Light honey such as acacia or clover. Allspice and cloves. There is a restrained sweetness that undergirds everything.

Taste:
A citrus bite starts things off mixed with sweet banana. The allspice and cloves then bite some and keep things in balance. There is a nice flowery note as well. The finish is soft and sweet with a touch of fading cloves. The spices accumulate as the beer is consumed.

Feel:
Soft, smooth and creamy. Body is medium with a lean towards the full side.

Overall:
A tasty and complex Heller Weizenbock. I prefer Dunkler Weizenbocks like Aventinus, but this beer isn't a slouch by any means. For me, this is a good beer for spring and early summer. I actually view it as a Weizen-based Maibock, with the cloves standing in for hops."
Weihenstephaner Vitus,4.36,"Hefeweizen appearance--hazy golden, just slightly translucent, with huge cap of foamy white head. Great retention, due to the wheat, no doubt.

On the nose, underripe mango, dried apricot, (good call from the brewery description) banana, vanilla, hay, white pepper, rich chewy white bready malt.

The mouthfeel is hefty and fluffy but made superbly drinkable through the fairly high carbonation that cuts through it.

A Weizenbock. This is a great beer."

Oude Geuze,5,Superb Gueze!
Oude Geuze,4.32,"750ml bottle into a tulip. Bottled 11/21/18, best by 10/26/38.

Superb looking beer. Glowing pale amber body with swarms of carbonation. Big bright white head persists in lesser form throughout leaving a lattice work of lacing.

Slightly funky aroma.

On tasting, not much funk. Dry, sour, tart. The other word that comes to mind is clean, not what you might think of in a gueuze. Such an easy drinker here. A small fruit note.

Mouth above medium, finish a dry sour tartness.

Overall, such a great example of the style, hits all the right notes, subtle, delicate, flavorful, not a bum note anywhere. A bit pricey, so a treat once in a while."
Oude Geuze,3.62,"bottle into glass
Minimal, white head. Very slightly milky, medium light orange, amber & golden appearance. Unusual, earthy and almost mildew like aroma, with a spiced and touch of vinegar tinge, as well. Definite lemony and touch of clove, deep down in the depths of the taste, with a light body and tanginess, with a little bit of a medium toasted malt underneath."
Oude Geuze,4.43,"Blend 43, season 19|20, bottle 4/2/20

It’s always an honor to drink a Gueuze of any kind, and this one seems to be one of the most popular, at least on BA. This is my first 3 Fonteinen beer since Armand passed, so this one goes out to him. Let’s dive in

Pours a hazy burnt orange with a finger of white head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The funk in the nose is soft, it really relies more on fleshy fruit than anything else. I’m picking up on aromas of tart peach, jammy apricot, lemon juice, wet hay, white wine, stone, white pepper, light cracker, and apple skin

It’s a bit more forward in taste, and still very damn impressive. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tart apricot, orange zest, apple skin, white wine vinegar, stone, light leather, and lemon juice. The swallow brings notes of tannic white wine, bready malt, lemon zest, white pepper, stone, wet hay, and jammy apricot

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a funky and zesty beer. Finishes mostly dry with more earth than tartness

Goddamn, I loved this one. It’s very nuanced but not overly aggressive. Sucks that Lambic has to be so pricey but it’s fun to splurge every now and then"
Oude Geuze,4.5,"A 750ml corked and caged bottle, blend°63, season 18/19, bottled on 3rd April 2019. Served from a 3 Fonteinen lambic basket, and poured into a 3 Fonteinen gueuze glass.

Appearance: A nice clear golden colour with a just over one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Lightly tart, barnyard, funky, oak, hay, green apple, with light lemon notes.

Taste: Sour, tart, funk, oak, hay, green apple, lime, lemon, with light notes of grape skin.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with high, lively carbonation.

Overall: Surprised I didn’t review this much earlier. For an Oude Geuze in the core range, this is right up there among the best in my opinion, along with 3F A&G and Tilquin Oude Gueuze. I also specifically picked blend°63 of season 18/19, because it’s been one of my favourites lately, since the paper label blends of 2015 and earlier. It’s just super easy and enjoyable to drink, it’s basically something I could down at all hours of the day."

Light funk in the nose along with a powdery perfume, sharp fruit, a vinous quality and what seems like it could be an aged hop aroma when swirled. Big acidity and a zesty grapefruit-like bitterness.

Pale gold colored body, clouded by the last dregs. Brief white skim of a head but a partial cap is long lasting. No lacing.
Aroma is like perfume that fills the immediate area of the opened bottle and filled glass. Complex funk of leather, hay and general barnyard.
Taste is sour but overladen by the musty funk. Leather straps and hay fields. Tends to be dry in the aftertaste.
Slightly heavier than medium mouth feel. Great mouth coating and release from the drying. Very good carbonation.
Such a complex blend that yields a main nose and flavor but allows for and almost insists on digging deeper with each sip. With oak and tart fruit."

Oude Geuze,4.26,"Season 18/19 bottled 13 March 2019. Gentle pour resulted minimal head with a golden body. Aroma of mild funk, acidity, and some earthy qualities but opens up more as it breathes. The flavor is equal parts funk and sour. The funk is different than Brett in an aged Orval. This is earthy with a sharp grassy/herbal twist. Flavor of sour apple and grapes with a leathery finish. Minimal carbonation and a light body. I like more lively body in my sour beers. A complex beer that changes as it sits in the glass."
Oude Geuze,4.02,"Deep gold body, dull with haze, forms a fine white head with average retention.
Aroma is acidic, apple orchard, hay, relatively light.
Intense, mouth puckering tartness and acidity, like an unripe plum, granny smith apple; some oak character; the feel is sharp, with fine, prickly carbonation, yet paired with a sticky softness on the tongue - refined yet aggressive; dry finish, long on the palate with vinegar-like flavours.

The feel is fantastic, so lively, and the flavour is very good, though not as complex as I might have hoped. That said, it's meticulously crafted, and a benchmark."
Oude Geuze,4.53,"16/17 vintage. this beer is bloody sensational. the balance between sweetness, sourness and wild funky flavours is perfect, it’s musty and funky and leathery and goaty, really oaky, pepper, walnuts, quite sour indeed, tart, acidic, vinegar, lightly bitter, sweet fruits, lemon, lime, lot of pear, some berry notes, slight white wine character, hint of caramel, lovely medium body, highly carbonated, super smooth, just a special beer, bursting with complexity and character while still being totally delicious, class."

Nice sour flavour with oaky and farmhouse notes."
Oude Geuze,4.99,"Opened on 3-1-21. Bottling date 11-21-18. Poured into a tulip glass.

A: The first pour was crystal clear and gold in color, but by the end of the bottle, was pouring hazy as the carbonation roused the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Thick pillowy and everlasting head.

S: Leads with lemon zest and a candy-like pithiness reminiscent of kumquat or candied orange peel. Some rose-like perfuminess through the middle. Cedar and a general woodsiness in the background.

T: Lemon, candied orange peel, and kumquat - all very pithy. The acidity is sharp at first, especially at the front of the tongue, but quickly mellows out into a tart/sweet apple and apricot flavor. There's an overripe melon funk that lingers. No barnyard, urine, or mousy character that I can detect.

M: Very lively and invigorating - the carbonation dances on the tongue and into the nostrils. Champagne levels of carbonation that carry the enticing aromas out of the glass.

O: This beer is complex, and hard to nail down. With each sip you are invited on a sensory journey, during which you try (and sometimes succeed, but mostly fail) to associate the flavors and aromas you are experiencing with past food memories."
Oude Geuze,4.5,"L: Reddish golden in color, like an apple cider. The cork had a good pop, middle carbonation, yet the nucleation is intense, similar to a nitro brew. Unfiltered.

S: Sour apples. Powerful and unique.

T: Sour, tart, astringent. It's complex--Many different flavors wash over the palate, at different times, throughout the glass... It is unfiltered and has the classic unfiltered Belgian flavor, it tastes organic like leather or hay... It's not exactly an intended flavor... What you're supposed to do is after you pour, let it settle for roughly 7 minutes, it will dramatically improve the flavor.

F: Like warheads candy, it begins extremely sour and ends sweetly and smoothly as your palate adjusts.

O: The schtick here is the long fermentation process, with bottle conditioning as a bonus. The longer the process continues, the more residual sugars are converted to alcohol, increasing tartness and dryness. The addition of unmalted wheat slows the enzymatic process, meaning despite it's long fermentation time, it retains a token amount of residual sugar. I would bring a bottle of this stuff in any situation where I would normally have champagne."
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.15,"Not Christmas, but I wish it was….
L: Big, foamy, even head. Looks fantastic.
S: On the sweet side. Light, caramel malt, bread dough, dark fruit, almost some wine? And a hint of hops.
T: Similar to the nose. Dark, sweet fruits upfront, then brown sugar and bready malt. There’s something citrusy in there to that adds a little…. pizaz. A hint of hoppy spice on the finish. Quite nice.

Whatever...
...you're only as old as you feel!

Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch light tan head over a translucent brownish amber body with some lacing. Nose of dark roasted malt, nuts, slight caramel, slight toffee, and even slighter chocolate. Taste mirrors nose fairly closely, a tad sweet and spicy with a very slight bitter finish of bitter chocolate. As it warms a bit there are definite flavors of pumpernickel and sourdough bread coming forward and staying right through the finish. Delicious! Nice feel and overall, what a treat for a lonely Christmas Day!
Cheers!!!"
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.39,"Gorgeous appearance of deep reddish-brown and a large, dense, khaki color head with great lacing. Aroma delivers a lot of ripe fruit along with the yeast and bread dough. Plenty of depth in the taste with the rich maltiness enveloping the ripe fruit and producing a moderately sweet aftertaste.

Corsendonk Christmas Ale,4.24,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Opaque dark mahogany color with a thin tan head that persisted throughout. Lots of fruity malt sweetness on the nose - plums, raisins, tart cherries - smells like a festive fruitcake! Pleasant bready malt-forward taste with the dark fruits and warming spice and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied that might benefit from a little more heft and/or carbonation. Overall though an excellent festive winter ale."

S - Abbey dubble catagory, raisin brown sugar, plum, pumpernikle, Then some nutmeg, ginger, pith, and the slightest clove.
T - Steers toward the beautiful malt, belgian candi, dark fruit, dried plum, a bit of cigar tobacco. Second wave brings on the spiced elements, there is excellent yeast expression contributing fruity esters.
M - Not a hefty beer, dances across the palate, stays in the sweet lane for sure, but avoids being cloying. The finish is surprisingly dry. Linger carries the dark fruit flag forward to the next sip
O - A very good warmer, the spicy elements are in proportion to the lovely base offering."

Banana bread aromas, dry bakers chocolate and nutmeg, some nice Belgian yeast esters. Chewy banana bread, bitter walnut skins, slight booze astringency. Finishes dry and it thins out towards the end. Not overtly sweet, there are some carob and nutty notes in the beginning that don't linger long. Medium bodied with a slightly distracting astringency.

It is easy to imagine that it is December and we are all waiting on a visit from Saint Nick. Corsendonk Christmas Ale is a well balanced dark ale that tastes like dark fruits, chocolate, molasses, plum, cherry and holiday revelry! I was very happy when I peered into the back cooler of my local country store and spotted a few bombers staring at me. My wife and I are watching The History Channel origins of Christmas, I found a gift for her that I had hidden away, and this Corsendonk Christmas Ale has made it Christmas in April. God bless us everyone!"
Corsendonk Christmas Ale,3.55,"Poured from a brown 8.5 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some fruits. Taste is of vanilla, malts, alcohol, some light cherries. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I was expecting more."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.37,"500mL bottle stamped 22.018 131021 poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 8.2% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light khaki head. The head recedes to a thin ring and partial layer of bubbles. The aroma is mild with clove, toffee and sweet wheat malt. The taste is semisweet, clovey, pear and apple laced dark wheat malt. Minimal bitterness. Slight alcohol presence on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, very good weizenbock. Not my favoritist style, but I can appreciate this one."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.68,"Mixed smell of plums, prunes, rum soaked fruit. Some malty notes including a fairly prominent spiced banana bread. Very pleasant creamy and full bodied feel. Would definitely drink again."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.77,The flavor delightfully remained on my palate after the mild flowing over my rounds of this delicious doppelbock. It developed a nice flavorful head when I poured it in to a glass. The feel was not heavy like some doppelbock s can be. I truly loved this beer.
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.56,"It's hard to describe a beer this good! Great flavor, smell, and texture."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,5,"One of my favorite beers!
So complex and delicious.
Too hard to describe in words."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.25,"On tap at Wurstkuche in Downtown Los A feels, CA.

Like visiting your local fishing hole and snagging a trout on your first cast, this one is legit. And the glass is cute like Ariana Grande with cat ears (before she got extra freaky). Either way, Aventinus is an Ace, Home Run, or a Slam dunk, what have you.

Get it on and get it good, my children."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.62,"L: dark amber, nothing too distinctive, but it's certainly appealing in a glass
S: rum, malt, and bananas
T: bananas, rum, raisins, malt, toffee
F: a single word will suffice; rich
O: it's really good, it's available in affordable cans, just grab one and enjoy one of the best bocks readily available."
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,5,"0.5 L bottle
Glass: .5L Weizenbock Vase
Bottle Date: 19.308 => 161019 => 16-Oct-2019
Serving Temp: 51.6 F


Look:
Cloudy and murky medium brown that is opaque from the yeast. I can't see my fingers at all through the glass, not even at the narrow point. 3-finger creamy beige head dissipates slowly to a 1-finger creamy cover. Great lacing
(This last bottle saw the ale starting to foam out of the bottle a few seconds after I opened it).

Smell:
Absolutely wonderful. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried fruits such as raisins and currants. Rich brown sugar. Overripe bananas. Bread dough.

Taste:
As good as it smells, if not better. Cloves bite at the front, but not all that hard. Rich toffee and toasted caramel joion in quickly, along with plums, those rum-soaked dried fruits and the overripe banana. There are notes of whole wheat bread and even banana bread. Some pepper and maybe a dash of cinnamon. Finishes with a lingering combination of rich dark fruits and cloves which somehow comes across as ever-so-slightly dry and spicy.

Feel:
Rich and creamy with a body that is on the heavier side of medium.

Overall:
What a joy to drink. A phenomenal beer. This earns it's World Class reputation. Although one can smell and taste rum-soaked fruit, the alcohol is actually quite well hidden. Very easy to drink. Dangerously so. Goes down smooth as silk but will hit you like a sledgehammer if you aren't careful. Great stuff. This is one of my favorite beers, and has been for well over a decade, if not 2. Absolutely worth trying.

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4.36,"Poured into a tulip, a large three finger head manifests. Tiny bubbles at the bottom, thick ones at the top, it slowly coalesces into a permanent, two finger thick dense, rocky, creamy foamy head that lasts the entire time. A slightly hazy, deep red-brown colour, this looks absolutely phenomenal in the glass. An absolute triumph. It collapses into one of the densest foam heads I’ve ever seen on any beer — not sure what some of the other reviews below are about, but maybe their cans weren’t as fresh as mine.

Very strong aromas of wheat and malt make up the base of the smell, slightly toasty. A little bit of boozy rum, and dried fruits like crispy sugared banana rings or raisins. Some spices and cloves of course!

Taste follows the nose but there are some new flavours here, such as banana bread, some nutty flavours like almond, and maybe even a little bit of orange? Spicy cloves, toasty wheats, chewy malts, the works! Fig, raisin, rum flavours as well. Complex, and even a bit subtle at times. Except for those wheaty, malty, banana spice flavours, those are always up front.

Smooth delicious mouthfeel, good carbonation that prickles your tongue without being too excessive as to wash away the flavours. Medium bodied I’d say, and it coalesces into a creamy gulp at the end of each sip. A nice long finish that is mildly sweet and keeps the general malts and candied fruits and banana on the tongue.

My oh my, what can you really say about this except for how good it is? I had to eisbock first and wanted to see how it compared. The Eisbock definitely concentrates some of the flavour, especially the malt and the darker flavours such as raisin and figs. So what is the difference? Other than the lower abv% here, the weizenbock keeps more of its dried and candied fruit flavours, and the orange/citrus fruit peel flavours as well. This one definitely has more banana in there as well. Both are champions of their respective styles, and in my opinion, the absolute top tier benchmark.

The Aventinus line is bold, beautiful, complex, and easy drinking. Absolutely phenomenal stuff. I’m overjoyed I grabbed the last 6 Eisbocks in all of Canada from the LCBO and always keep my fridge stocked with a couple of the regular Aventinus as well. 100% an absolute must try if you like German beers, or honestly, if you like beer in general."

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,4,"I'll preface by saying I went back to my job because I wanted the Eisbock but it turns out we just have this so I didn't exactly get what I wanted but anyways, I don't find this near the banana bomb some reviews say, I wish It was there more, to me this tastes very similar to the Belgian beer Kwak. Heavy on wheat and clove where as the spice and banana is super background. This is really good but idk how much I'd seek this in the future I really wanna try the eisbock"

F: Lightly carbonated. Light mouthfeel.

§ucaba,4.38,"2018 release
consumed 8/22/22

rightfully a classic of the style. The 2018 bottle is very smooth and although I taste the alcohol, it's very easy to drink. The bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced. As it should be, the mouthfeel is thinner than a BA stout. This is a wonderful world class beer and always worth having on your shelf or fridge."
§ucaba,4.54,"Had the 2018 version, on tap at Other Half DC

Dark, mostly opaque reddish brown, still somewhat see through, tan head.

Raisin, boozy, maple, toffee, oak, fig jam on the nose. Taste follows, but with some coffee bitterness to go with the fig, raisin, clove, toasted sugar, chocolate.

Probably best barleywine I’ve ever had, boozy but not over powering, somehow everything seems in place (where I often find barley wines to be unbalanced in one way or another)"
§ucaba,4.5,"12 ounce bottle, 2019 vintage. 01/19/2019 is stamped on the neck of the bottle, I'm assuming that's the bottled on date. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. If you're into English style barleywines then definitely pick this one up, I'm glad I did!"
§ucaba,4.94,"2018 Sucaba, enjoyed November, 2021.

Rich, warm, intense cola brown in the glass. Light aroma, with toasted coconut standing out. Thick, almost excessively so, with a long finish. There’s a hint of hops on the end, sticky and sharp."
§ucaba,4.54,"No head, hazy caramel brown body. Smell is rich— bourbon whisky dominates, with caramel malt, figs, tobacco, and a healthy rye spice. Taste is more subtle than expected. Figs, brown sugar, whisky, cherry, just a hint of coconut, vanilla, and lots of rye spice. Smooth drinking. Nice alcohol warmth. Not as overpowering as expected, which is good. It has balance, and plenty of going on. What an amazing sipper. If I had a cellar, I’d jump on another bottle."

§ucaba,4.36,"Firestone Walker Sucuba Vintage 2019 Barley Wine Ale.
11.3 % ABV. Firestone Walker Brewing, Paso Robles, CA.

Dark mahogany-hued, slim white-ish head.

In the nose: Big, boozy barleywine aromas, popping out the wazoo. All the earmarks of a classic big ol' barley-wine. Ablaze with all the the raisin and fig, the woody character, the deep malty, chocolatey, tobacco and leather notes.

In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty. Yum a dum, dum. I could have sat on this another five years, but I just had to try it now.

One of the best barleywines I've tasted in a good long while. Mmm, hmmm"

§ucaba,4.17,"Deep brown to light black in color with minimal light penetration. Murky river water complexion which is true to barrel aged barleywine. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering a third of the top. The aroma is a plethora of malt, some vanilla, and some bourbon. I taste vanilla, sweet malt, and bourbon. The mouth is sticky, chewy, and boozy."
§ucaba,4.15,"Bottle Date: 2018
Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese

Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.

First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this.

Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.

On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)

At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.

I need to revisit this one."
§ucaba,4.63,"Poured cold into a tulip glass and allowed to warm to cellar temperature. Dark brown in color (I'm guessing around 40 EBC), with a thick tan head that left some nice lacing as it settled. There's nothing subtle about this one. Huge aromas and flavors of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, and licorice, accompanied by notes of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Very sweet and quite boozy, with a little sweetness lingering on the palate. These FW BBA barleywines are truly something special, and this one is well deserving of its lofty ratings."

Doubleganger,4.64,"Nice and hazy. Two finger head that dissipated in a short time. Some lacing. I was interrupted after pouring it.

Treehouse makes great beers, and this is one of their best."

L: Pours a hazy deep gold with a white fluffy head with big bubbles. Pretty and irregular lacing.

A: Aromas of mango, peach, and tangerine. More complex as it warms.

T: Follows the nose beautifully up front, then a surprising hop punch - with no burn - in the middle. Finishes dry but not too bitter.

F: Soft mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Pleasantly sticky and resinous aftermath.

O: This is a typical Tree House tropical/citrus delight until the mid-palate hop jab sets it apart. Not necessarily better than the standard offerings, but a bit more distinctive."
Doubleganger,4.25,"Fresh cans from Sandwich, enjoyed on Cape Cod and back home in Nashville.

Glowing orange-gold body of haze and near-murk — pure juice. Medium head of compact, off-white bubbles. Fantastic lacing.

Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. But if the familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.

Taste could follow but is a little overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down a notch or two. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness. But this is more of a sharp green, chalky note that steels from the experience.

Feel is velvety soft and wonderfully coating."

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.
Review #7,979"
Doubleganger,4.68,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.

Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.

Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.

Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop. A bit too green and bitter when cold, it developed into a smooth and nicely balanced juice with just the right amount of everything. One of the best Tree House beers I've had so far."
Doubleganger,4.13,"16oz can at share. Hazy golden pour, small foamy head. Aroma leans towards tropical fruit, although there are some supporting citrus elements. Taste is zesty, fruity, juicy with some alcohol warmth. Smooth."
Doubleganger,4.07,"Pours an opaque dark orange, frothy 1.5"" head, solid lacing. Nose is orange juice, mango/papaya, musk, light resin and pine, peach rings. Taste has moderate tropical sweetness balanced by muted, flat piney hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, soft, and full. Solid, but hard to see what differentiates it from other THs save a slight uptick in mouthfeel."
Doubleganger,4.66,"Otherworldly flavors surprised me after smelling ""only"" good, maybe my sniffer was malfunctioning, because this is truly delicious stuff - almost happy it's not found in my state as I'd be drinking a lot more beer than necessary."

S: ripe pineapple with a hint of apricot;

T: follows the nose from start to finish; mild to moderate bitterness at the end;

M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; moderately dry finish; soft; hides the ABV well;

O: smooth;"
Doubleganger,4.98,"Pours rich orange with a great amount of carbonation. The initial flavor is rich sweet oranges with a slight pithy finish. The dryness is minimal, you'd swear you were drinking a nice mimosa. Perfect brunch beer."
Doubleganger,5,Excellent. Best Tree House beer of the lot.
Doubleganger,4.47,"Intensely aromatic nose, lush with tropical fruit notes. Similar on the palate, with notes of mango, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and very mild dankness. Mild green herbal notes.

Not quite as creamy or full bodied as other Tree House IIPAs, but it’s still a wonderful balance between soft creaminess and bite. Low perceived bitterness."
Doubleganger,4.74,"can dated 9/1/21 yes freshness matters I think 2 weeks is awesome & 3 weeks the limit., The beer just tastes different after.


Super hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. (not my words)

Smell is juicy fruity dough

Taste is aggressive but balanced wonderfulness (if you like dank & hazy) so smooth that sadness permeates your empty glass. Just a bitterness reminder on your tongue that lasts. It tastes like sad regret.

Feel is unicorn & rainbows

Overall what a good time. Can you expect more from a beer? A Treehouse all-star."
Doubleganger,4.33,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)"
Alter Ego,4.22,"Not my favorite treehouse offering… but neither is Julius. This one has an interesting almost grape bubblegum thing that was hard to nail down exactly. More melon that citrus. It’s just another treehouse beer that you have to try to see how it compares. But for me, there was nothing standing out that i could really appreciate or even describe. Its very smooth drinking but to a fault in that it lacked any kind of bitter or pithy punch on the finish."
Alter Ego,3.17,"This one was just OK for me, much better IPA options from Treehouse in my opinion."
Alter Ego,4,"Now I think people fall into this Treehouse hype and believe me it is deserved. They make some of the best beers in the world. However, this is just a solid New England IPA. I have had things similar. Thick orange color with a fluffy head and bursting with citrus flavors. Where this separates itself is in its smooth drinkability. It goes down like an orange juice."
Alter Ego,4.18,"Pours an opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has notes of over-rippened tropical fruits with a hint of citrus. The flavor is the same over-rippened tropical fruitiness combined with a grainy quality. Like its less-evil twin Julius, the finish is pithy. Oddly enough, however, I think that Julius has a more potent bitterness.

The body is definitely hearty for the style."
Alter Ego,4.5,"Two months old. Can to willi.

Look: Pours a full and hazy, slightly brownish yellow. Fluffy white head, lots of lacing and no floaters.

Smell: Citrusy notes of orange, lemon and grapefruit complemented by hints of pineapple, white grapes and apricot.

Taste: Ripe tangerine and grapefruit paired with tropical mango and pineapple. The body is sweet and minimally zesty, the finish bitter and dry.

Feel: Full and juicy, almost creamy. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Great alteration of Julius with some added citrusy freshness rounding off the sweet base very nicely. Certainly one of the best sub 7% ABV IPAs out there which doesn’t have to shy away from its bigger siblings."

Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

Alter Ego,4.46,"Canned 4/27/22. “You can call me Al” stamped on the bottom of the can

So this was literally canned fucking today. That’s wild to me, as fresh as Tree House can be. This is one I’ve somehow missed every time I take a trip out to the brewery, but I’m happy to finally get to it. Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well. Let’s get into it

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya

It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

Yet another killer NEIPA from Tree House. Better than Julius, but not quite as good as King Julius still. Maybe it’ll be even better when it’s not so fresh"
Alter Ego,4.5,"Pours a cloudy orange yellow color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass alot and stays as a small film over the beer. Smells of mango, citrus, and some cracker notes as well. Tastes of mango, citrus, and melon. Smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, this is a good feel to it. Overall, another banger from Treehouse!"
Alter Ego,4.75,"My favorite Julius derivative. In fact, I prefer it over the OG."

Alter Ego,4.25,"Probably has the most bitter flavor of any TH beer I’ve had yet but it has enough sweetness to balance it.

Delicious."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.41,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.64,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.56,"Look - Very little head with almost zero retention, and no signs of much carbonation. Opaque black in color.
Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.
Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon.
Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.
Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.27,"12oz can, dated 01.29.2020, 2019 vintage stamped on the side of the can, poured into a 14oz brandy snifter.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, brownie batter and fudge but also a nice bitterness, dry cinnamon, light pepper heat with a super smooth bourbon character, lightly charred oak, modest roast with nice hearty grains and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy, chewy but smooth and it coats very well with a warm but creamy finish.

Verdict: A very nice adjunct forward barrel aged stout from Spiteful. A great chocolate forward experience that is well balanced and accentuated by the cinnamon and pepper interplay while the vanilla tames the barrel, which isn't too hot and offers even more nuanced character."

Overall solid Barrel Aged stout, glad Spiteful released this after a three year hiatus."
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,4.08,"Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly.

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.

Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.

This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat."

Dragonsaddle,4.17,"pungent flavors of sharp pineapple, pulpy and slightly acidic orange juice, some minty and pine character, a hint of doughy sweetness and a mélange of smooth fruity flavors. however as it warms I do get this sort of unpleasant chalky character on the back end that has a bit of a peppery spice to it. good flavor but just a bit rough around the edges."
Dragonsaddle,4.15,"Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20

Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass.

Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges.

Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish.

A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV."
Wookey Jack,4.23,"Served on tap at the Firestone Walker Tap Room at Paso Robles, California.
A: Pours a very dark brown with a foamy, one to two, light brown head with fairly long retention and decent lacing.
S: Aroma of medium roast coffee and molasses aromas predominating for the most part.
T: Nearly semisweet. Interesting combination of black coffee, molasses, dark chocolate, and plum. Nicely balanced with bittering hops causing a clean, refreshing finish.
M: Medium bodied with solid carbonation. Full mouthfeel.
O: Enjoyable. This looks and tastes an awful lot like a Porter/Stout."
Wookey Jack,4.11,"Gorgeous beer, black with high beige, fluffy head, lots of sticky lacing. Soft bitter aroma, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, dark bread. Taste is light, as in not overwhelming, but tingly sharp on the tongue, mellow bitterness on the palate. Complex but easy to drink. Nicely done!"
Wookey Jack,4.58,"A really excellent beer that makes me want to explore more black rye IPAs. One of the best looking beers I've ever had--color of a porter on the light side with a head of an IPA. Laces beautifully. It has a short, hoppy nose. Taste is excellent with the dry hops coming out from front to back of the mouth. Feel is a bit boozy and ever so slightly overcarbonated but that's the only real downside. Superior brewmanship from Firestone Walker."
Wookey Jack,4.56,"Reviewed off a note I made back in 2013 or so, even though the review is being submitted in 2020. Pours inky black, with a tight, small ecru head. Good lacing. The smell is not roasty, but lightly floral and fruity; more apple than berry. The taste is of a smoky, bitter roastiness. There’s a bitter aftertaste, but a clean finish. It’s like bitter chocolate, with a hint of ashes, leaving (perhaps despite these similes) an overall quite good impression. The feel is that of smooth, foamy carbonation. Great beer! Too bad it’s evidently no longer out there."

Notes via stream of consciousness; A friend of mine introduced me to Wookey Jack about a year ago. He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it's hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can't compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I've got in front of me, given that it's well over a year old, it's surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I'm not sure when this was discontinued but I haven't been able to find it - I'm sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine & More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There's a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it's not bad, I'm still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there's one thing that's missing it's that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I'm going to miss this one. Hopefully I'll come across some that's been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that. This is the best black rye IPA that I've ever tasted, and probably one of my top 10 favorites - or at least one of my top 10 favorite dark beers, that's definite. A moment of silence. ... ... ... Wookey Jack, you will be missed."
Wookey Jack,3.99,"The appearance has a black body with a three finger off-white foamy head, leaves some clingy slightly foamy lacing in rings. The smell has some slightly roasted coffee. There is some rye, slight citrus/pine coming through in a spicy sort of way. The taste is mainly bitter, some slight coffee - but mainly subdued, hopped - yes, but balanced and extremely flavorful. There is a dry yet bittersweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable - maybe perhaps, and the ABV slightly felt. Overall, I’d say this is very good for a Black Ale and I would come back to this."

Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.4,"Purchased at Bound Beverage, Warrington, PA. $18/4pk

Pours a jet black, totally opaque color. A very light skim of a head on the initial pour.

Aromas of sweet malts, chocolate and bourbon. Smells delicious.

The first sip follows the aroma with a sweet, malty chocolate taste with a distinct bourbon background. Slightly acidic aftertaste. The bourbon aging is done perfectly as it never overpowers the beer. The ABV is lurking there but isn’t dominate.

A rich, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Leaves a nice coating in the mouth. Medium carbonation.

Overall, a delicious stout that ranks up there with the best. A beer that truly highlights what a stout can be with the proper barrel aging and care that Central Waters has given this brew…highly recommended. Cheers!"
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.09,"Appearance: Pours a very dark brown body with a medium-small-sized, light khaki-colored head.

Smell: A sliver of char with woodsy, bourbon-moist barrel tones leading to bittersweet chocolate morsels, smooth roast and brown sugar with a slight fruitiness of blueberry, blackberry.

Taste: Sweetish, chocolaty with plenty of warming oaken, spiced, woodsy, bourbon tones, a bit charry and ashen. More brown sugar and again the softly tangy fruitiness, but it's fairly well-integrated, as in its not ganky-level sweet or housing a jolt of fruitiness. Final zip of fruitiness, sweetness and heat, though it wraps up reasonably dry for a big stout.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-light carbonation. Just a bit chewy, though far from being gummy or gloopy.

Overall: It houses a sound richness yet the beer is surprisingly well-attenuated, tasty and tight in its overall execution."

Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.91,"I am an enjoyer of delicious stouts, and this is one of my absolute favorites.

It's f###ing delicious. This beer reminds me of Hoppin' Frog Torris, beautiful rich chocolate and warmth. The Barrel here is a perfect complement to the flavor profile of the beer. Some great berry notes as well.

For lack of going on for too long, if you like chocolate and bourbon, this is going to be a great beer for you. I am a simple man but this beer hit my benchmarks of those two. Not very smokey, with heavy fruit and chocolate, plus this beer does what many BA stouts fail to to: get the barrel right. Somehow the flavor of barrel is very prominent while letting the underlying flavors shine through. Hard to do!"
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.18,"2014 bottle opened in 2021. From fridge temp. Pours black with some head. Quickly dissipates. Dark fruit dominates the nose. Not totally sure if this is a good thing or not. Cherries, blackberries, and strawberries. Chocolate and roasted malts are there as well. The taste is really good. Not getting much barrel, but this starts to come through as the temp goes up. Mostly dark fruit – like raspberry dipped chocolate. Roasted malts, oak, black licorice, molasses, fudge, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms. Mouthfeel is nice and thick."

Consumed 5/19/21

I didn’t mean to age this guy this long, but I’m excited to see how this will go. I think like a lot of Midwesterners, this was my first barrel aged stout. It’s a classic beer! I remember buying it years ago thinking I was being fancy spending so much money on a 4 pack of beer for my Mexican BYOB dinner. I paid no attention to the abv, and promptly got drunk at dinner. Unlike Goose’s BCS, this is the perfect introduction to a barrel aged stout. It’s a strong beer, but not overwhelming for a newbie like BCS. After drinking these for a few years though, BCS and higher ABV stouts usually take the win for me. Still, I can enjoy this on a weeknight at least. Onto the beer...
I smell the bourbon which for me is hugely positive. I’ve grown to LOVE the motor oil double barrel 15% and above barrel aged stouts. On the nose, it’s clear this isn’t that but it’s going to be tasty. It’s a bit thin for my favorites. Black Gold is thicker. This is like BG’s baby brother. Drinking it I feel I’m drinking a nice barrel aged Porter rather than a stout. There’s wonderful vanilla notes. It’s super smooth which I contribute to the age of the beer. I like the bourbon notes too. I wish I had opened up this versus a fresh one to see how the aging has affected it.
Overall this is a classic beer and would always recommend it. Central Waters knows what they’re doing. Black Gold beats this guy, but I’ll it them again and always recommend them for newbies and experienced barrel aged stout drinkers."
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.19,"Served in a snifter glass at cellar temp just like the description told me to do.

APPEARANCE: Super dark, black hole-like black. A decent head foams up and sticks around longer than expected, but as with any barrel-aged stout that's close to 11%, it doesn't last long aside from a few splotchy patches on the surface and a thin ring around the edges.

SMELL: Not sure how long this was aged, but the wood comes through strong in the nose, along with a dark, roasted coffee aroma. A little dark chocolate is detectable too, but it is far outweighed by the oak and roast.

TASTE: That oak is still quite strong and really provides a pleasant, woody backbone for a complex array of flavors - bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, deep roasty flavors, a little cherry, orange, fig, and mild booziness. This is really a rich and delicious beer.

MOUTHFEEL: At no point does this beer stray too far into sweet or too dry. The beer starts out with a bitter-sweet, orange-cherry-chocolate and finishes with a warming alcohol burn and roastiness. The sparkle is light, but more present than it is for some other Imperial Stouts I've had.

OVERALL: Just a treat. Every time I can get my hands on some Central Waters I'm happy, and this one did not disappoint. Not sure if following the directions to put it in the snifter at room temp made a difference, but it certainly didn't hurt! Great beer from a great brewery."
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.43,Pick this up at the village estate in Ohio 2020 edition into a stein. Great looking beer deep dark blackness mild Brown at the base with a nice half inch of mocha froth. Smell is pretty mild chocolate notes some mild oak a good amount of bourbon some coffee roasts but it seems pretty well blended. Taste is unexpectedly smooth as well very nice rich oak flavor smooth leading to some mild bourbon notes and a nice mend of bittersweet chocolates and coffee roasts. I could see why this rating is so high it's very balanced and easy drinking leading to the mouth feel of medium to heavy and smooth despite the almost 11% ABV. overall I am kind of floored that I only got one of these if it's still around I'll probably pick up a couple more a very smooth and balanced Bourbon barrel aged beer!
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.77,This has become one of my favorite beers which I can still find.

L: Black body with clear chestnut highlights. One-inch head of tight tan foam that recedes at a moderate pace and leaves spotty lace. A little thin-looking on the pour, but that's to be expected from CW. Just fine.

S: Rich, bourbon-soaked brownie. A bit nutty, a bit roasty, and nicely restrained. Excellent.

T: Cola, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, coconut, and booze. The finish is a little astringent and bitter, but everything leading up to that point is excellent.

F: Thin and soft, with ample velvety carbonation. Definitely out of step with the way the style is usually presented, but pleasant enough in its own right.

Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.71,"This is a great BA imperial stout. Comparable to hopping frog barrel aged TORRIS the tyrant, which is a compliment from me. Big chocolate - bourbon and chocolate will delight you if those are your thing. Less coffee than others, and not extremely complex. If you like bourbon and chocolate, stop reading and buy the beer.

I've been drinking this when I come across it for a number of years now – you really can't go wrong with it. Very decadent and extremely consistent quality, and there isn't anything I don't like about it.
If you buy this to get a great barrel aged stout, you'll be making a good decision.

I have had this beer for a number of years now, and the consistency is strong. As opposed to some other yearly brewery's BA stout releases, I have essentially never noticed a difference between years, which frankly I love in a beer sometimes. Surely it changes with age, but if you are reading these reviews in the future, it's safe to say that new versions will be consistent with these reviews even years on. Source: have bought it for 4-5 years now and it's consistently the same quality/flavor profile. Whoever is on QA over there is on it"
Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Stout,4.34,"A good BA stout. Chocolate molasses smell is good, but a little simple. Taste follows the smell, but has a little more complexity to add interest. The mouthfeel seems a bit thinner than expected, with the fine fuzzy bubbles. Overall, a very good beer."
Stickee Monkee,4.22,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy."

Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful. The barrel is prominent and it’s perfectly sweet. I don’t know what the aging has done to this bottle. It’s super smooth but was it harsh before? I doubt it. I’d probably drink this fresh in the future. A world class beer and perhaps the best quad you can find? One day I’ll find a Westy 12 to test that theory."

Beyond Good And Evil,4.81,Amazing stout - not too sweet.
Beyond Good And Evil,5,"A perfect BA maple stout. Had on site at HF, was a 2018 vintage. Perfect."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.5,"2018 vintage on tap. Tan head. Black color (dark brown).

Smooth, silky, light roast, light heat. Awesome bourbon and fudge notes. The maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels. Toasted marshmallow. Chocolate. Full bodied, great feel. Very surprised with how much I liked this as I haven’t enjoyed hill stouts in the past."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.56,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half
S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected
O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

91/100"
Beyond Good And Evil,5,2018 version poured from the bottle into a snifter. I find this tremendously tasty. The viscosity coats the glass nicely. Wonderful maple flavor without being over the top/too sweet.
Beyond Good And Evil,4.45,"Finally trying this one, march 28 2021, bottled 10-3-18. For me the feel is just outstanding, full and creamy and smooth, approaching syrupy, but still with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable. It’s Hill Farmstead, of course the feel is going to be exceptional. The aroma is strangely mild but the flavor explodes with maple syrup and whiskey notes and has to be the sweetest of any HF beer I can recall. Just lean enough to stay in balance. Very nice drinking."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.6,2018 Vintage
Beyond Good And Evil,4.33,"Had high expectations for this beer but ultimately found it average, especially when compared to top tier stouts."
Beyond Good And Evil,4.16,"18 November 2020 - Beer #207 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade
Current Rank: #105 on Beer Advocate

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 4 - not very intense, but what is there is divine. Pure maple and barrel.

Taste: 4 - nothing mind-blowing here, just a straight up barrel aged maple stout. Maple is tough to do well, and this is done well.

Mouth: 5 - this is where the beer really shines. It's thick and sticky, and I don't want to swallow it; I just want to chew it for a while.

Overall: 4 - very excited to have tried this one. Not obsessed but satisfied.

Cheers!"
Beyond Good And Evil,4.43,"Pours jet black with minimal head. Smell of chocolate, barrel and slight vanilla. Taste of chocolate, maple and coffee. Neither the coffee or maple overwhelm the base stout. Feels thick and decadent but cohesive. Another great HF brew."

October 2019, roughly 10 months old.
L: black with dark mocha head.
S: vanilla, chocolate, bourbon.
T: chocolate, oak, vanilla, maple, caramelized sugar. Pancakes.

Overall: solid bba stout. Fair amount of heat."
Miller High Life,3.87,"Took a 18 pack on vacation. Pleasantly surprised. Poured into pint glass. Smooth crisp taste. Lacing on the glass.
Brings me back to a time of easy drinking and stress free times. Price doesn't hurt either"
Miller High Life,2.39,"Every six months I purchase a 40 oz. bottle of this beer hoping that maybe my taste buds were having a ""bad day"" the last time I drank it. I really want to like the High Life but just can't get past the greasy vegetable oil aftertaste finish this beer gives. Maybe its the Galena hops that they use. I tried to find other beers that use these hops but have had no such luck. Molson Coors has retired very drinkable & palate pleasing lagers such as Extra Gold & even Milwaukee's Best Premium. Hamm's and Banquet are the two most enjoyable AAL's that this brewery brews. Not being a ""hater"" I will buy and drink a 40 of MLH in hopes I will see and taste
something different."
Miller High Life,2.29,"Acquired as part of a trade/proxy with @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022.

As with all Miller beers, this one looks gorgeous in the glass. It's a crystal clear yellow with a bright white head and bubbles racing up the middle of the glass. It leaves nice lacing on the way down. This is how my old man's beers looked when I was growing up in the 80s. But as with my old man's beers, once you go from eye to mouth, things start going downhill.

On the nose, there's a corny sweetness. It's not appealing in an age of tropical fruit bombs or rich, roasty stouts. There's no hop presence and in fact very little aroma at all. This won't scare off the beer's intended audience, though.

Taste is a letdown even after the nose. There's a minerally, soda water vibe going on. There's some sweet malt, but it's like the beer is produced with postmix and even then the beer syrup in the packet is on its last legs. There is utterly no hop body. The beer has some bitterness, so there are clearly hops in the beer, but maybe they were only waved in the general direction of the boil, rather than actually inserted.

Feel is ok. The carbonation comes through more strongly than I would have expected and it definitely overshadows what taste there is, so the sensation on the swallow again brings to mind carbonated postmix. I've seen a few reviews that point to the beer's excellent softness and generous mouthfeel, but I just don't get it.

I specifically requested some American macros in the trade/proxy that this beer came in, and I'm glad I did, and I will again. Even living in Australia I'm aware of the iconic nature of this beer and its tagline. I'm also aware that it no longer lives up to what a craft beer drinker wants in a beer, but then nor is it meant to. There's an audience for this beer, and it's not a craft beer drinker, but it is a craft beer collector who wants to experience the full gamut of the world's beers, and I'm very much in that camp. It's near impossible to get it through normal channels and I'm glad I went to the effort to get this one. I've loved receiving, pouring and drinking this beer, even though as far as beer goes, it's pretty ordinary. It'll get marked up a little in the overall mark because ultimately it's my overall experience I'm rating here, and in those terms it didn't disappoint at all.

Cheers!"
Miller High Life,2.52,"Poured into a beer mug and it was a really clear light golden color with a thick white head. Could not really smell much of anything in the glass. Decent taste and a good thirst quencher, especially on a day after working in the yard or around the house."
Miller High Life,2.67,The marketing of this beer promises a high quality experience but it is swill not much different than the regular Miller.
Miller High Life,3.92,Looks good smell is not offensive but sweet. Taste has a strong malt sweetness . Very distance hop flavor like all the way at the end of the street. Mouth feel is extremely smooth. I have drank like 200ish bottles in order to make the review and it is a great beer for the price been buying it for 12 pack bottles for $6.50
Miller High Life,3.28,"Poured from a 7oz pony bottle into a rocks glass.

On the pour not a lot of head forms because there is so little liquid and I was a bit too gentle. Over a couple minute the head actually grows from the streams of carbonation rocking up the sides of the glass. Body is a light golden color just a touch darker than straw, leaves light lacing. Good looking beer.

Aroma is grainy with some skunked hops present. This is likely less present in the canned version, but the clear bottles will definitely be skunky. The skunk isn't overwhelming but present and verging on bad. The maltiness of this beer isn't completely covered however. Some corny vibes but it doesn't smell watered down.

Flavor follows the aroma and loses a bit of the skunk amd trades it for a sweet grainy crisp flavor. Some cheapness does come through but miller makes some pretty good cheap beer. The flavor profile is pretty soft and bready with some very very light notes of the hops on the very back end, however they do still provide some bitterness.

Feel is where miller shines the brightest. On the sip isn't feels big while still being refreshing and not too heavy in the stomach. Big carbonation on this one, but it's fine carbonation giving this one decent body.

Overall I think miller makes one of the best American mass market lagers out there, and so far they haven't let me down. Sweet without being too syrupy and bringing the malt flavor that not hoppy beer should have. Refreshing and not too many off flavors like some AALs."
Miller High Life,4.87,"Miller High Life is my cheap domestic beer I drink while I'm grilling or BBQ meats. It's good, smooth, and cheap."
Miller High Life,3.45,This is not a bad beer at all. I guarantee in a blind taste test it would pass for a craft beer.
Miller High Life,5,"An American classic. It’s a crisp, clear, and flavorful and finishes smooth every time. My go to American lager."
Miller High Life,2.75,Most all domestic beer seems to be a disappointment nowadays..Most beer drinkers think that it used to be of much better quality. Miller High Life was at one time regarded as a quality beer then became a cheap trash beer of the 80ies and 90ies. Few years back they improved it with newer type shelf stable yeasts and the quality has actually came back and it's not too bad compared to the other domestic beers out there. With that said I still miss the quality that all domestic U S beer used to have and now lacks.The big breweries think beer drinkers are uneducated slobs and will drink anything because they can't tell the difference.
Miller High Life,4.26,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds. This one is showing a strong running - no offensive smells or flavors. A light-bodied, easy-drinking super-bready malt, I think it's top contender at the moment to unseat. I'll sort this all out and revisit my reviews/ratings after my quest completes."
Miller High Life,2.68,To style or...?
Oberon,4.5,Pretty good summer ale.
Oberon,3.83,"PKG: 3/24/22 opened and reviewed on 6/12/22

Look: slight haze to the straw gold liquid. Puffy white foam rises high with fat clumps of lace.

Nose: Spicy, husky wheat and summer field golden grains. Spicy, herbal and fruity in the back.

Feel & Flavor: Very light and clean feel with a nice spice kick, herbal and soft with a tingle of light fruitiness.

Overall: I love that this is an American wheat bear sans the big Banana and Clove funkiness all over the place. This one represents clean wheat, grains and a herbal, slightly fruity hop thing that all jives together."
Oberon,4,A solid American wheat. Tastes like summer.
Oberon,1.8,"It can be quiet frustrating to drink a beer that feels like nothing. With Oberons in season, you're likely to find these things at graduation parties or summer barbeques. You can also find Two-Hearted Ale, Modelo, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Corona at these occasions. Now is Oberon really better than these? No. Is it really worse? Well it can't be worse Heinekein or a Stella."
Oberon,4.25,Delicious and smooth
Oberon,3.77,"May 1, 2022 - Hazy straw color, fluffy white head, lacy; tastes like beer, pretty good beer, mouthfeel is good beer. I’ve never been particularly impressed by wheat beer but this one’s not too bad. I like the big fluffy head."
Oberon,4.12,"Canned 3/14/22.
Hazy yellow with one finger of white head.

Light banana and vague citrus aromas, with some bready/yeasty malt smell.

Taste is orange+lemon creamsicle, but less sweet , light dried banana, bread crust, finishing with some coriander+black pepper spiciness that has some bite to it.. Light lingering bitterness

Feel is light-medium, juicy, smooth, light-moderate very,very fine carbonation tingle. Finishes with sharp bite on tip of tongue, followed by a drying feeling.

Smooth and easy-drinking. A classic for good reason. :)"
Oberon,4.06,"I have been looking for this for a while. I only just randomly found it at a World Market, cool. Poured from a bottle into a spiegelau American Wheat Beer glass.

Looks - Hazy golden honey color. Beautiful look to it. The head is nice, white, and fluffy. The head doesn't die out easily. Lacing is kind of minimal. If you look up beer clip art, this kind of has a classic beer look. Very attractive.

Smells - Kind of tangy. Like, I would expect this beer to be tangy. Mildly fruity (pineapple?) with some malt in there. A slight bit of vegetal spice in there too.

Taste - Very nice. Not too bitter, not too sweet. Cherry-like notes with some lemon-esque pineapple. Mild spice and peppercorn fruits. Malt in the middle as well, wheat is very prominent and gives a classic beer taste while also being varied enough in notes. A zing of bitterness in the finish. Finish isn't too long.

Feel - Pretty smooth, fairly light. Easy drinking. Not very effervescent. Doesn't coat the mouth too much. Highly sessionable. Smooth, fairly velvety.

Overall, I enjoy this one. It's different from other hop-foward ales I'm used to drinking. Has a nice hop to malt balance. I've been searching for beers in the American Wheat Ale style. My only other exposure is Little Sumpin. There is contention around LIttle Sumpin being an IPA or an American Wheat Ale. I tend to be on the side of it being an American Wheat Ale...but trying this has me changing my mind. This is stylistically different enough. Not as bitter as other ales, but not too sweet. This would be great at family parties."
Oberon,4.63,"A truly wonderful beer!
Beautiful golden color, a little hazy. Very nice head and wonderful full-bodied taste. A great summer beer and no fruit! A remarkable accomplishment, which I highly recommend. On top of everything else, it was reasonably priced."
Oberon,4.18,"draught
Nearly clear, medium light gold, in color. Nice fresh, yeasty, light malt aroma, with a little tang (herbal?). Pleasant, up front malted barley (wheat?) grain flavor, with a touch of spiced herbal hop nuance. My first Bell's beer tasted, and at their main taproom no less."
Union Jack IPA,4.3,"Dirty gold in color, clear with slight chill haze that goes away, white head with nice retention and some lace.

A slightly tropical big dose of orange citrus and rind, with a hefty dose of sappy pine.

Taste mirrors nose with the tropical being gone, orange citrus rind and pine; on a nice subtle sweet malt background.

Medium body, the hops bite you on the tongue, super resiny dry and crisp bite of high bitterness, like eating a pine needle.

This beer is west coast hop nirvana."
Union Jack IPA,4.22,"From a mixed 12 pack while traveling way out west. I have had this years ago, and with the preponderance of Hazy/Juicy/Soft IPAs it is nice to find a proper west coast IPA still kicking in the wild.

Everything you wanted from an IPA in 2010. Resinous pine, drying grapefruit, pineapple..."
Union Jack IPA,4.21,"A - Lovely pour, crystal clear pale orange body, white head, fading to a thin line whisp. Fine lines of lacing.

S - Strong note of hops, a bit of pine, thin sharp resin and mild fruit.

T - Nice, bright fruit open, undefined citrus, a hint of pineapple comes with a solid malt middle, and a present, bitter bite in the close.

M - Prickly carbonation, slightly light weight, very, very clean finish.

O - Subtle, tasty IPA, well-designed and so very crisp and clean. Good stuff."
Union Jack IPA,4.75,"A very smooth citrus taste makes this, for me, more unusual than the usual slightly bitter or very tangy citrus. Worth drinking, for sure."
Union Jack IPA,4.32,"Pours copper color and creates a decent little white head. Nose is ignites the salivary glands at first inhale. Piney and citrusy fill the nostrils. Taste is not as bitter as I imagined, however there are hints of resinous goodness through the full taste profile. Very good IPA, but those words do not give it justice."
Union Jack IPA,3.84,"This is a typical West Coast IPA, that's for sure. I got more of the piney flavor than anything else, but there are a few different hops in here for sure. I didn't really get the mellow honey-like flavor that the description promised because of the amount of hops in there. If you like IPAs you'll surely like this one, but this is not my favorite style, so I tried it because I wanted to see if it was worth all the fuss. It's good, but not my thing."
Union Jack IPA,3.94,"12oz can into pint glass.

L: Medium gold, about 1"" of head that fades a little but not completely. Good lacing.
S: Resinous, a little pineapple action.
T: West Coast through and through -- all pine, with a little floral character. Lots of malt backbone. Bitterness hangs on for a while.
F: A little too thick for my preference. Definitely resinous but I don't think it's as dry as others.
O: A solid beer. I think I prefer some of the other Jacks that FW makes, but if I'm really angling for a West Coast IPA it surely ranks among the best available in PA."
Union Jack IPA,4.08,"Firestone Union Jack is delicious, a classic west coast IPA. Here in Colorado for reasons I ve not a clue you can t get the Great Grapefruit Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. The Firestone would be a main go to b3cause i5 is so good, but I am always trying new. I kind of love this beer."
Union Jack IPA,4.29,"From a 12 oz can:

Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, ok head.

Smell: Citrusy, mild sweetness.

Taste: Nice citrus bitterness with honeyed bread malt body. Finishes with a lasting bitterness, delicious!

Overall: Union Jack has been a favorite for a while but I finally got around to reviewing since it is usually unrefrigerated and old around here. Nice old school IPA with solid bitterness and a good malt base."
Union Jack IPA,4.5,"Pours golden yellow with a 2"" white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is floral, strong pine, spruce, grapefruit, caramel.

Taste is pine, spruce, strong grapefruit, caramel, resinous.

Medium body, moderate carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.

This is a very good west coast IPA."
Union Jack IPA,4.25,"Poured into a Nonic.

Pours a slightly chill-hazed medium gold with a decent head and excellent lacing.

Quite a range of aromas. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, caramel malts meet floral, grassy, and piney aromas.

Definitely West Coast, yet still rather well balanced, thanks to a proper start. Caramel malt and honey-kissed graham cracker on the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to grapefruit bitterness, which evolves quickly into a resin-fest in the mid palate, before that surrenders to a more delicate, restrained floral/grassy bitterness at the finish that hints at the deceptive bitterness that comes from a wild clover honey.

Medium bodied, but well carbonated. Has a nice, relatively short and drying finish.

Firestone Walker is not available in the Dakotas, so glad to have grabbed some of this one while in Illinois. This is a badass WCIPA."
Union Jack IPA,4.25,"Had on tap at Bulldog Saloon Lynnwood, WA"
Union Jack IPA,4.19,"12oz can fill date 5/19/21 into a large snifter.
L: Pours a lightly foggy perfect amber color with a sudsy pock-marked 1/2"" white head that dissipates shortly to edge foam. Low carbonation. No lacing.
S: Orange, tangerine, pineapple, berries, sweet malt. Rather floral.
T: Hop forward. Tangerine, pineapple, pine, cedar, spicy hops, black tea, grassy light crackery malt. Moderate pine lingers in the finish though it is not intense.
F: Mouthfeel is clean, brisk and medium-full bodied and is mildly assertive. It is a little bit dry and has a medium-long finish.
O: Overall a very crisp, well balanced clean, hop-forward beer that drinks very easily and is quite accessible to a wide variety of palates. It has a bit of a bitter edge but is not over the top. It is excellent in it's style of West Coast IPAs."
Union Jack IPA,4.31,"Pours an amber color with a big head which sticks around. Outstanding America IPA which is super hoppy, mildly sweet due to tropical fruit (citrusy including grapefruit) with some malt."
Union Jack IPA,3.79,"500ml can; 04/23/21. 2 months old.

no glass lacing
bready, boozy, clean taste but pretty nondescript. not overtly hoppy at all.
Overpriced and overrated."
Union Jack IPA,4.17,"12oz can. Clear amber colour with a thin, short-lived head. Rich, slightly smoky, caramelised orange aroma. Intense marmalade, overripe citrus and resin flavours. Very solid bitterness. Thick and oily mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A classic old skool West Coast IPA. Lovely."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,"beautiful dark red look. Very foamy.

Flavors of chocolate, cream, figs, dark bananas, caramel.
Amazingly well balanced.
In my opinion it beats the westy 12 or st bernardus 12 by a mile."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.99,"Salted caramel, banana, rum fruit cake. For what I can recall, compared to the 8, richer with less fruit and slightly more acidity."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.5,Smells & tastes like dark fruit. Super smooth in taste & feel. Very well hidden ABV 11.3%. Definitely world class & superbly well done.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.65,"One of the finest Belgian - no - one of the finest any-style beers in the World.
Every aspect reads Excellent. Pours deep bronze with classic foamy head that stays awhile as it warms in my La Fin du Monde chalice.
Smell is exotic spice and dark fruit. Little bitta banana.
Taste is plums, fig, cherry and date. Spice, corriander. Boozy tingle.
Feel is smoooooooth, just enough effervesence, there’s a lingering mouth feel.
Overall, World Class!"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.63,"This beer is why I now have a BeerAdvocate account.

It might be summer, but this quad will populate my fridge en masse this winter. Just fantastic, full, complex flavors that you will not find in much else. I drink this and imagine a rainy, cold night enjoying hours of rom-coms with the missus. Really great, really nothing like it."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.42,Up to this point I have held Abt 12 to be the standard of the Belgian quad… might have set a new bar with this one. The depth of flavors. The warmth of the flavors. The smoothness. It is just a very good beer.
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.38,"Pours a nice reddish-brown colour with and amber head and slight lacing.

Smells of dark fruit, spice, caramel, and an alcoholic rye-like note.

Taste follows the nose. Intense flavour of aged dark fruit up front with a lot of spice and apricot. Sweet notes in the background of caramel and bready malt. The spicy alcohol profile is very similar to what you get on a high abv rye barrel aged ale. It's pretty intense but it fits the style and flavour profile really well.

The mouthfeel is full bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. Kind of acidic, very smooth.

This beer is awesome overall but it's pretty far off of my favourite abbey quads. I won't get this again for a while, but I don't regret buying it, even though I paid $10 for it. Very complex beer with a ton of intense flavours that embody its style very well."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,3.64,delightful belgium quad - great ale taste
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.54,"4/29/22 12oz bottle at Pies and Pints Fayetteville WV.

What depth of flavor! Beautiful bite/zing right away! Banana on the nose. Dark apple cider color or dark honey. Warming alcohol all the way down!

Unbelievable! I can't do justice to this with my description!"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.7,"Like Chimay blue but more of everything. It really smacks you in the face. Dark fruit, yeast, pepper. It's beautiful"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.64,"Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.

Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.

As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.

Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour.

It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.9,"#174, quad that does not disappoint!"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.88,"I've had a few really good Belgian ales before, but this one is very close to being my favorite.
Received via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.
Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.
Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon.
The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!
The feel, well, excellent. Almost, but not quite, viscous. I still opted to drink this slowly and savor it, for it is worth savoring.
OA, amazing beer. If you get the opportunity, get it."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,Frigging outstanding
Trappistes Rochefort 10,4.76,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. Dark brown opaque color with 1 3/4ths fingers of light tan head on aggressive pour. Head stays for a while with decent lacing. A little bit of alcohol legs too.

S - Nice light caramel malt up front. Some good dark fruit scents. Almost a red or port wine. A slight sweetness. Maybe even a nice sweet bread.

T - Some alcohol in the front along with the malt. Slight chocolate, possible cola. The dark fruits and port wine are in there as well. Good complexity overall, so that each taste can find some slight variation

F - Nice high carbonation with a full frothy mouthfeel.

O - Overall, this is an excellent beer. Well deserving of it's high ranking. The complex taste of malt, dark fruit, and everything else is a pleasing experience. I highly recommend this beer and will keep purchasing it in my annual rotation."
Trappistes Rochefort 10,5,"Appearance: Dark brown, frothy khaki colored head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Malty with strong dark fruit aromas, hint of alcohol.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Immediately warming, alcohol is noticeable. Caramel, pepper, spicy, plum & raisin. Mild bitterness.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied, effervescent, drying

Overall: Excellent Trappist beer. Has the characteristic champaign-like effervescence. Malt forward with darker fruit flavors, caramel. Spiciness is prominent and pepper. Good medium to full body mouthfeel. Has some balancing bitterness, but it is barely noticeable. Alcohol is noticeable, quite upfront, but it is 11% ABV. It is amazingly drinkable for a high carbonation, 10% plus ABV beer. Found no flaws in this one. Have to give it a 5 for being a world class Trappist beer."

First drink was surprising - in that I was expecting a belgian yeast, but it wasn't there. Also lacking was the coriander - though it has a prominent orange juice taste. Goes down easy, clean, not much of an after taste. No discernable hop bitterness or hop citrus hit. I was missing the belgian yeast taste and at least a bit of hops nose to it. Frankly, it tastes like a generic clean ale with some orange juice added.

Certainly a good lawnmower beer, but nothing special and really an outlier of a belgian wheat."
Shock Top Belgian White,2.69,"Just average Belgium white, similar to Blue Moon. A good drinkable beer especially on hot and humid days of mowing the lawn or just working your butt off."
Shock Top Belgian White,2.62,"Why all the hate? If you're looking for a ""day"" beer, try it! It went down easy, didn't leave me feeling bloated and it's refreshing. I dug the citrusy (?) taste and the huge slice of orange that it came with enhanced the flavor more."
Shock Top Belgian White,3,"Of the big macro commercial wits out there, this is bottom of the heap. Barely passable on a summer day - do yourself a favor and get UFO or Blue Moon instead. Or just get Allagash - now in cans too haha."
Shock Top Belgian White,2.64,"Orange, hazy, lt white head, did not stay around. Brady, citrus, light on flavor. Easy drinking. Orange slice would help."
Shock Top Belgian White,3.77,"I don’t understand the hate shock top gets. I think it’s a lot better than Blue Moon. It’s unfiltered so it looks funny but I think the lemon, lime, orange is better than Blue Moon’s Valencia orange"
Shock Top Belgian White,4.15,good
Shock Top Belgian White,2.72,"On-tap at the local dive - review from notes

Clearish yellow with a head that lasts. Smells like orange pine-sol, not terrible but sorta chem-y. I like the taste of this, but can't have more than one at a time. Has a harsh grain alcohol element, otherwise it's easy drinking

OK for girl beer ;)"
Shock Top Belgian White,3.1,"Orangeish liquid. Drank from bottle
So can’t comment on head and lacing. Smell is somewhat fruity. Orange and maybe lemon but it was a stale smelling fruitiness, not necessarily like fresh ingredients. Taste follows suit with a bit of spicy complexity. Not a bad beer. Not a good one either. It is refreshing."
Shock Top Belgian White,1.2,This was my first time so I have to honestly wonder was this awful or expired? This had this weird yucky taste to it than wasn't like anything that a belgian white should taste like. Fortunately this was a kind of light nastiness. Idk expired or not I don't get a good vibe and this was just nasty.
Shock Top Belgian White,3.24,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy (~35% opacity), medium golden color with a medium white head. Bubbling and aggressive. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Mild aromas. Some faint pale malts, grains, and hints of citrus. Not much here. (3.00)

Flavor: Flavor is mild too. It has mild pale malts upfront before a sour and grassy note in the middle, before some faint lemon citrus notes. Has a sour and leafy note that lingers. Only mildly sweet. Minimal yeast too. (3.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied, lower carbonation. Finishes with a slight sour note on the finish. (3.25)

Compared to Stone Dayfall 6/13/21: Pours an identical color. Milder aromas/flavors. More sour lemongrass, Less orange, orange peel, bergamot flower, and jasmine. Winner: Dayfall

to Blue Moon LightSky 7/12/21: Pours a darker color. Milder aromas/flavors. More pale/adjunct malts with a larger body. Less juicy orange.

Overall: A pretty bland beer here. Even a disappointment for knowing what I was walking into. The appearance was the best part. Minimal aromas and flavors altogether. A mild sour note is really all I detect that lingers. People on here have described this as similar to Blue Moon, but I would think that Blue Moon would drink far superior. This was bland, sour, and flavorless. (Final Rating: 3.24)"
Shock Top Belgian White,3.9,Very simple citrus taste. Could be used with anything.
Shock Top Belgian White,2.39,"Average to slightly underwhelming. Its hard to not come off a giant beer douche while writing this, but it’s the truth. Shock Top on a summer day is delightful, but after a few sips it just becomes rather meh. That being said, one of the best homemade shandys I’ve ever crafted was with Shock. 1/4th Newman’s Lemonade and 3/4th a glass of Shock and damn you got a good mix. But, if you’re beer needs Newman’s help to be considered good, you don’t have a very good beer. All in all it’s pretty much like gas station coffee: it’s there, you know it sorta tastes like coffee, but it’s not great."
Shock Top Belgian White,2.3,"Great packaging, thought it was an import, just another A-B beer that has no character"
West Ashley,4,"SARA does great with all their Saisons. However, I expected the apricot to pop out a bit more than it did. I enjoyed this beer very much but felt like the hype perhaps made me have higher expectations. I’m very interested to try again and taste other vintages as well."
West Ashley,4.59,"Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam!

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime.

The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.

In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping."
West Ashley,4.58,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh sweet apricots and light barnyard funk.

Taste - What strikes me about this beer is how well the apricots and saison funk work together. At the front, the fruit was sweet and fresh before turning funky in the finish. The finish was tart, but not overwhelming.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power.

Overall - What a well-crated saison!"
West Ashley,4.87,"One of my favorites of all time of any style.
Roll the bottle around before opening to get a little bit of cloud from the yeast on the bottom, if that's your thing.
Smells like lemon, sour cherries, peachy.
Tastes just like the smell. Dry, smells sweeter than it tastes. Hint of funk.
West Ashley used to taste a lot more tart, but just tastes like sweet nectar now after having it so many times."
West Ashley,4.56,"Orange citrus with peaches, this is so easy to drink its no wonder it is in a 750ml bottle. Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that."
West Ashley,4.68,Always great
West Ashley,4.94,Poured a glowing orange hue. Oozing apricots on the nose. The taste was well balanced apricot. Perfect amount of acidity. This is a world class beer.
West Ashley,4.56,"A bit overly tart, but immense fruit and love the mouthfeel of this beer. Westly is the King for SARA, but this is just a notch below"
West Ashley,4.53,Soft nectarine and huge waves of orange for me with minimal apricot. Perfectly balanced tartness to compliment it as well
Pannepot Reserva,4.5,I think I like struise pannepot better over struise pannepot reserva
Pannepot Reserva,4.07,"330ml bottle, 2018 label, 06.10.2020 dated (+5 years), poured into a stemless wine glass.

The beer pours a deep burgundy color, cola hues with a thin finger of khaki head, loose bubbles that offer no retention nor lacing. The aroma is nice, deep rich stone fruits, hearty grain, brown bread, clove, fruity yeast, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, raisin, and licorice. The flavors are good, lots of stone fruits, raisin, licorice, strong Belgian yeast, brown sugar, caramel, lots of brown bread, soft oak, anise, and a bit of spice. The mouthfeel is okay, coating, a bit thin, a little more on the flat side than expected but with a hearty finish.

Verdict: A nice Quad from De Struise. The beer could use a bit of life in the body, but flavor wise, it's all there. Delivering the type of complexity and depth that makes the Quad such a captivating style."
Pannepot Reserva,4.53,2018 Bourbon BA version
Pannepot Reserva,4.74,"One of the best beers I ever had. Unfortunately there was just one good for consumption, the two other bottles in the shop were badly bottled and tasted weird after being bottled in 2018."
Pannepot Reserva,3.94,"2017.

Not easy to drink due too overly sweetness."
Pannepot Reserva,3.98,"2012 vintage

Because of the very low cask-strength carbonation, neither the appearance nor mouthfeel sit with me well. I have the same complaint about the mouthfeel of nitro stouts that I think suffer because of the lack of carbonation, which is critical to what makes beer good imo. Aromas and flavors are great, though. Tastes like a fine port or other semi-sweet red wine, with nice complex bourbon overtones. Four years in the barrel does wonders to any beer

80/100"
Pannepot Reserva,4.52,"Urbain excels at creative craft brewing within each style of beer he has produced.
The deep brown pour with a garnet hue and produces a rich sandstone head with no prolonged lacing
The smell is full of deep malt, raisin and brown sugar.
Flavor is exceptional with a complex balance fruits, malts and yeast.
Overall the beer is a very well balanced Quad with wonderful / full big mouthfeel but not filling. This is a big beer Beer with a balanced footprint. I have aged these beers for 4 year verticals and they pair well many raw milk Goudas, Alp Cheese, and Vacherin..."
Pannepot Reserva,4.51,"The beer pours a dark brown with a thin layer of tan head that dissipates immediately. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of raisins, grapes, licorice, and cherries. The beer tastes of raisins, grapes, licorice, and cherries. The feel is full, complex and smooth. A really nice Quad."
Pannepot Reserva,4.98,"Exceptional. Hard to beat in a quad. Unfortunately, hard to find in the U.S."
Pannepot Reserva,4.36,"One of the best gets better. Bottle shared by Rich from 2008 series. This one aged very well, still as smooth and slick as butter. Dark dried fruits, yeast, typical Belgian ale but oh so tasty."
Pannepot Reserva,4.12,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with light tan head. Aroma of molasses, caramel, brown sugar. Moderately sweet and sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel, toffee, molasses, brown sugar. Very nice Belgian beer that hides ABV very well."
Pannepot Reserva,4.06,"2012 vintage. Pours burnt umber with a medium head that surprisingly didn't leave lace. Nose is quite woody with a hint of burnt caramel and sour cherry. Taste is vinous as expected from the nose. On the dry side for a big quad, although much of that may be perceived due to some tannins amplifying the bitterness. A touch of dates remain, but also red wine. Some light vinegar characteristics of an oud bruin as well. Interesting and complex, but the way it comes together actually detracts from the overall enjoyment of the beer."
Pannepot Reserva,4.53,"2008 Vintage

Look: Opaque cola brown with a thin eggshell colored head. No activity visible. It’s a bit muddy looking.

Smell: Rich and sticky. Toffee, dates, figs, caramelized sugar, poached plums, oak, and port wine. Very vinous.

Taste: The attack is all dried dates covered in honey. This drys up quickly to a quenching body of leather, tobacco, vanilla, burnt sugars, cinnamon, oak, red wine poached plums, slight alcohol, figs, and mores dates. The fruity notes continue on the finish with rich drying oak notes.

Feel: Surprisingly smooth. Quenching body with a dry finish. Mild carbonation. Aqueous. Alcohol is present but it is smooth as it warms the chest and not at all abrasive.

Overall: Pretty incredible stuff. It reminds me a lot of a rich Sangiovese wine given it’s deep complexity and the way it develops across the palate. There are so many rich and yet cohesive notes as the beer runs its course. The brew is also quite difficult to review given the age. There are no apparent off flavors or defects due to age besides a drop off in carbonation. Instead it is just so smooth. It actually seems to be almost watery because of how smooth it is. One of my most unique experiences in beer drinking. One of those beers that expands the mind on what beer can be. Incredible."
Pannepot Reserva,3.91,"Picked this up back in 2008. I thought I did a 10 year vertical of this last year but apparently not. Heck, that's my picture in this beer listing...

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a clear deep mahogany hue with no real head, just a little bit of wisps. Solid legs.

S - Aromas of sticky plums, caramel, sweet (but not cloy) malts, little bit of oak. Nice raisins. Actually quite enjoyable.

T - Taste is similar to the nose. Definitely old, little bit of oxidation. Thankfully no real cardboard flavours. Sticky plums and raisins, little bit of alcohol sweetness. Rather woody, little bit of an almost smoky ester thing going on which is really bizarre. The raisin and caramel is quite nice, but, the other aspects clash with it.

M - Mouthfeel is rather nice, surprisingly, lightly carbonated but not cloy or sticky.

O - Overall it was a solid quad, probably should have drank it 2+ years ago but still, it was fun to try!

Serving Type: Bottle"
Pannepot Reserva,4.59,"Vintage 2010.
Poured from 0.33l bottle into chalice.
L: Pitch black color with a weak tan foam haed.
S: Whisky, red wine, plums.
T: Sweets, plums, caramel, grapes, oak barrel.
F: Tight body and low carbonation. Interesting aftertaste.
O: Fantastic balanced De Struise quad. One of theirs best."
Pannepot Reserva,4.78,"A 2010 bottle that I purchased in Iowa last fall and buried in the beer fridge. Pouring it in my Duvel glass for the occasion.

Look- Pours a dark brown with a ruby tint that makes it look like whiskey. It produces a small finger of creamy tan foam that slowly settles leaving a thick ring around the glass. No lacing is present.

Smell- Boozy alcohol like aged port or single malt scotch that opens up to figs, raisins and a hint of cherry. There's a little wood that creeps in.

Taste- Boozy dark fruit with plums, figs, dates, raisins and cherry. A touch of caramel sweetness and dry oak in the finish.

Feel- Velvety slick up front yielding to some alcohol heat and a slightly dry finish.

Overall- In a word? Wow! This is one complex beer that tastes and drinks like a spirit or port wine. It still packs a punch and the glow I'm feeling as I finish this bottle makes it seem bigger than a 10% abv. beer. I have a couple more left and will be keeping my eyes open for this again as I'd love to try different vintages. I was shocked to see this wasn't rated world class."
Abricot Du Fermier,4.4,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible.

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this."
Abricot Du Fermier,4.55,"Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. Blend #5."
Abricot Du Fermier,4.75,"Truly excellent beer. Not too funky, but plenty of saison characteristics. Pleasant apricot flavor. Dry finish. Aging in wine barrels gives it a subtle booziness."
Abricot Du Fermier,4.9,Great brew!
Duvel,4.69,My favorite Belgian Pale Strong Ale. So refreshing and delicious. Does not at all taste as strong as it is.
Duvel,2.16,A strong bitter aftertaste
Duvel,4.56,"L - Poured from a standard bottle into a large wine glass. Huge head on mild pour. Light golden clear color. Head slowly dissipates to thick suds with mild lacing, and then to a healthy film that stays through the beer.

S - Light fruit and sweet scents up front. Some apple and possible citrus. A pleasant sweet yeast scent appears part way through drinking. Some more earthy tones are noticed as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet fruits like apple, pear, and mild citrus., but adds some spice in there. Some muted floral notes appear as you drink. Not bitter though. More of a sweet yeast flavor as you drink. And then some more earthy flavors come out as well as it warms up. Agitation brings back the sweet fruit characteristics, but definite sweet yeast as the main flavor. Somewhat boozy toward the end.

F - What a smooth mouthfeel at first. A healthy amount of carbonation stays as you drink it. Top notch.

O - Overall, this was a fantastic and enjoyable beer. I had casually avoided Duvel assuming it was a generic European macrobrew. I was wrong and this beer is a treat. I will definitely add it to my regular rotation."
Duvel,4.51,"Gifted from a friend and couldnt wait to indulge but took about 10 minutes to pour, so I waited. Beautiful look pillowy head, golden color, slight aroma, bready, taste of clove, banana spice, prickly mouthfeel, hoppy but balanced - worth the wait, good beer"
Duvel,4.89,"Great beer and a reliable go-to for so many situations. Light golden pour with great carbonation and a huge, lasting white head. Spice, bread, and fruit, with a mix of white grape, apple, and pear. Very effervescent and a nice, dry finish. Fantastic. Never disappoints."
Duvel,4.17,"Pours a beautiful, clear pale golden-straw colour. Three finger thick white creamy head slowly compacts into a one finger, dense foam that lasts the rest of the beer.

Interesting and subtly complex aroma, slightly sour aromas of gentle funkiness. Earthy, more like damp leaves and wood than a horse barn kind of funk. Yeasty esters play around with a slight bitter, floral and grassy hop smell. Subtle banana and cloves, typical of most Belgians. I might have an older bottle, but I swear there is a vinous, grapey smell as well on a deep inhale. A tiny bit of bready, toasty malt, but I find it takes a backseat to the sour viney damp smells.

Taste is very subtly complex as well, very pale and gentle sourness on the tip. Earthy and moist like wheaty aromas. Some subtle yeast notes with the malt. There is a savouriness as well here. I’ll mention again I think my bottle is older, which has brought out some nifty aromas and I think tempered the flavours a bit and evened them out. Some bitter citrus peel is noticeable as well, and a pleasant bitterness on the finish that is semi-sweet, a bit viney, with a white grape like taste.

I didn’t notice the alcohol as much as others. This is a light-medium bodied beer with good, medium level carbonation. Nice bittersweet, grapey and bready finish that is mostly dry.

Pleasant, complex, and easy drinking. I’d love to try a bottle that is super fresh just to compare. I’ll leave the review like this for now and hopefully come back soon!"
Duvel,4.91,I’ve been to this magnificent brewery few years ago. A visit not to be missed. This is def my favorite ale. Top notch!
Duvel,4.55,"Pours a translucent lemon yellow with a healthy white head creamy/foamy. Smell is (wow) first impression is lemon, decaying autumn leaves, clove,almost a pine like scent,very earthy. Taste is spicy herbs,(clove) , hint of banana,some malty goodness. Feel is well carbonated,(think champagne) finishes dry and juicy, Overall this is not like any other Belgian beer. I had this many years ago in Brussels and it still tastes just as good. Really good-"
Duvel,4.18,"Smells like a citrus and bread, maybe even a small bit of grassiness that is also in the flavor. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some bitterness in it but not bad, some small fruit smell and flavors along with malt and barley and breads. The alcohol is noticeable but not too noticeable, to me this is the perfect higher ABV taste, with bold flavors but not a whiskey taste. As you continue drinking it gets more and more enjoyable. Great beer. Not a note-able aftertaste. The feel is semi-heavy."
Duvel,4.35,"Smells sweet like honey as soon as I opened the bottle. A little banana as well. Tastes of banana and bubble gum. This beer is very carbonated and I feel it overpowered the taste. It is a good beer, glad I tried it but doubt I will ever buy it again due to price. I would love to try it on tap someday to see if it is less carbonated."
Duvel,4,"As a someone who was introduced to Belgian ales from Unibroue's interpretations, I was excited to find one of the staples in my local liquor store. I had a great experience with the Chimay range and was looking forward to this one.

Nose: Mild, semi sweet malt

In the Glass: Well foamed or formed head, rises quickly to show it's pale golden shine. Great looking beer.

Palate, Crisp, orange citrus, sharp bitterness that fades into a full body of well malted barley. Crisp and sharp but not bitter.

Finish: That sharp citrusy body fades into a mellow alcohol and malt flavour.
Overall I can see why people covet this Ale. Unlike Chimay and Unibroue's offerings you do taste the High ABV with this one, hence the 4/5 rating. Not perfect but a fantastic ale."
Duvel,4.63,"Amazing Belgian beer. Have it again!
Plenty of carbonation. Feels like a cider. Spicy and refreshing in the same time.
An afternoon treat!"
Miami Madness,4.33,"2021 vintage

My first review of 2022! Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit

It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple

A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart

This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield Berliners"
Miami Madness,4.24,"Bottle pour at Other Half Finger Lakes in Bloomfield, NY.

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk.

This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to.

This is light bodied, crisp, clean, and pleasantly sour on the finish, with a very nice drinkability.

This is most certainly overhyped, but it's still a well done and enjoyable beer through and through."
Miami Madness,4.9,"#84, yummy!"
Miami Madness,4.38,"Pours a OJ. Nose of mango, guava, passion fruit. Taste follows - excellent fruit. Feel is medium with medium carb. Overall - it lives to what it says it is. Do not think it is complex"
Miami Madness,4.57,Bottle share courtesy of Hopelessly0.
Miami Madness,4.41,"This is the best Berliner I've ever tasted, although this is coming from someone who doesn't really love Berliners. Bright color and outstanding fruit flavor, the guava really shines through. The best part is the finish though, it's perfect. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too dry. Just perfect."
Miami Madness,4,"A decent brew that is way over hyped and way over rated. Don't get me wroing, it's good, it's just not THAT good. There is a lot going on in this beer, some pleasant, some not. Worth the try!"
Fourth Dementia (4D),4.14,"2013 vintage; consumed on 2/9/2022

Pours a clear, deep, ruddy chestnut brown body capped with a slight finger of fluffy, off-beige foam; solid head retention leaves a thin layer of intermittent cap, a thin, creamy collar, and virtually no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma is entirely dominated by and centered around twangy raisin coursing throughout; an underlying dusting of bakers chocolate details figgy esters and faded caramels over time, while an increasingly luscious and jammy raisin holds focus.

Taste opens to raisin juice accented with toasted fig, burnt black bread, and molasses, with distant chocolate and wisps of nutty undertones progressing to the mid-palate as dark fruit jam peaks; brown sugar born from a residual sweetness phases into intermittent booziness amplifying subtler dark fruit esters as they linger through the finish.

Mouthfeel features a rounded medium body with a composed, moderate-high carbonation, lively yet rounded while dispersing to slick, semi-syrupy, even textures over the mid-palate, and eventually drying as a distant char balances a moderate warmth through the finish.

Approaching a decade in the bottle, this old ale has refined and embraced an undeniably one-note character, sparking depth through sheer focus on a singular profile development to showcase a concentrated display of age across a quality base; an increasingly decadent sipper by way of a stalwart longevity."
Fourth Dementia (4D),4.57,"Blind review:

M- Smooth, full body. 4.5

O- This is excellent, easy to drink and very well balanced. 4.5

After thoughts:
This is a 2 year old bottle and I’m getting an oaky quality to this, even though it is not the barrel aged version it does have a lot of flavors I tend to notice in barrel aged beers."
Fourth Dementia (4D),3.78,"Rating from notes. Consumed January 2014. ""Good in small doses due to aggressive sweetness. I enjoyed my sample but would never be able to finish a full bottle. Worth trying for the novelty though."""
Fourth Dementia (4D),4.49,"Murky brown, some foam.

Malty.

Syrupy sweet, brown sugary, could use some char/smoke flavor. High ABV is hidden. Maybe the faintest bit of tart. No complaints here, hits all the right notes.

Medium bodied."
Fourth Dementia (4D),4.79,"Appearance - Pours mahogany brown with a nice thick tan head that settles to a thick ring. Great lacing everywhere which surprised me for the ABV.

Aroma - Big aromas of fig, plum, oak, bourbon, very mild vanilla. Lots of toffee, caramel and brown sugar.

Taste - Oh lord, much sweeter than expected. Lots of brown sugar, caramel, raisin, fig and plum. Big vanilla in the taste much more than I picked up in the nose. Really a rich sweet flavor, the bourbon and oak come through well.

Feel - High side of medium, great carbonation slightly warming but very smooth and easy drinking for the ABV.

Overall - Excellent beer, I love the taste the nose did not prepare me for the vanilla sweetness."
Fourth Dementia (4D),4.92,"Look is dark brown and opaque with minimal khaki colored head. Aroma is crazy, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, bready malts, and the slightest barrel hit. All the scents show up in the taste. Starts with dark fruits, then caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. The finish is strong sweet vanilla and bready malts. It’s sweet the whole time, but never overly sweet or like a dessert stout. Mouthfeel is pretty thick. Somewhat prickly but also kinda smooth. Overall this is world class amazing."
Fourth Dementia (4D),3.89,"Pours a dark chestnut brown. Small lighter brown head 1/5"". Aroma is quite boozy, but it also throwns a dense layer of rum cake malt booziness, chocolate, earthiness, wet wood, tobacco and wet leaves.

Taste takes those smells and puts a warm sherry like presence throughout the first few sips, it takes about 20% of the bottle to get accustomed to this. Molasses and raisins, the unsweetened variety. The amounts imperialized toffee and lesser caramel is not too damn high but it makes you think about it. You're not breathing fire but you can feel some of the heat on your tongue. Has that dense ass brick feel of a loaf of dark bread with booze dumped in the punch bowl.

In the right scene, these can be nice to chew on. A treat, but nothing I'm ever going to want to have multiples of in a sitting."
Dinner,4.78,Been waiting over a decade to try this beer and even longer to visit the brewery. Finally did both! Had it on draft and took a few bottles home with a date of 26AUG22. This absolutely meets the hype. Incredibly delicious and absurdly drinkable for the ABV and style. SO fruity and so floral. The smooth body and delicate mouthfeel are truly impressive. This is the real deal.
Dinner,4.47,"Pours a dirty darker straw color; cloudy but see through; white head that laces quite beautifully, a dense film lingers and lingers.

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.

Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.

This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.

Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer."
Dinner,4.14,"I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night. The appearance was that of.....beer. Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head. The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either.

The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer.

The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing. Very full, creamy and pillowy. Absolutely excellent.

Overall, I though this was a very good beer, led by the aroma and the feel. I hope to be able to luck into some bottles sometime right around a NBS BIF so I can share it with others."
Dinner,4.36,"From a 16.9oz bottle, dated 07/29/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.

Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.

Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.

Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.

As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right? (Replaces a 4.46 rating without a review from 11/05/15… thank you, Dr. J. for the rare opportunity to have this one again)."
Dinner,4.79,"Just an amazing step up from Lunch. Another classic from Maine Beer Co. that really lets the tropical nature of the hops shine through. Where Lunch is a mellow, refined take on the style and very clean, Dinner is a punch in the mouth and in a good way."
Dinner,4.25,"Tried at Moe’s with Tim, 7/8/22"
Dinner,4.49,"On tap at Sabatini's in Exeter pa yesterday.

Looks very good in the glass. Honey yellow body with a nice white head. This eventually shrinks to a thin ring, good lacing early on.

Delightful hoppy aroma with a side of mixed fruit favoring the non citrus.

On tasting, smooth, hoppy, delicious. Fruit notes confirm the nose. Very easy drinking, abv fairly well hidden but you get the feel of it.

Mouth close to full, finish manages to be clean, but full of hop flavor.

Overall, have missed out on this one the last few times it was at Sabz. Not this time. Beautifully crafted dipa. Seemingly simple, but a lot of thought has gone into producing this classic."
Dinner,4.33,"Look - hazy thick golden copper color with a really nice white head that sticks around and leaves great rimming and lacing when drinking
Smell - classic hop top notch. Floral citrus slight pine slight caramel malt
Taste - class dipa with it's hop bitterness. Citrus floral pine like the smells with a slight booze.
Feel - full body and carb
Overall - the smell is just ibcyand I was hoping the taste was going to live up to it but in my opinion it didn't. Great classic ipa though"
Big Eye,2.95,"355 ml bottle, from Fakta Hirtshals. BB date is hard to read, but probably 25.03.2014. Slightly hazy deep golden to amber colour, moderate to low head, slightly off-white. Strong and unpleasant aroma of stale orange marmalade and rotting fruits and vegetables. Distinctly hoppy and resinous flavour, better than the aroma, not too sweet, with a solid bitterness in the finish."
Big Eye,4.06,From 5/21/16
Big Eye,3.94,Taste of Cistrus with a hint of pepper. Dry and Hoppy
Big Eye,4.21,"This beer changed my palate! I was drinking a lot of Sculpin and maltier IPAs and then this...that dank, garlicky, something different.

Yes, Big Eye brings big IPA flavor to the table and is bold and different. If you like IPAs try this one. It’s got a big dark malt backbone but then citrus and danky, earthy hop bittnerness battles against that malt and...yeah. I get excited about this one but to me it’s a late night beer..even a sort of winter IPA."
Big Eye,5,Best Ballast Point brew in my opinion. Would take this over Sculpin any day.
Traditional Lager,3.23,"On tap at Diamonds Billiards Cape Coral, Fl
Looks copperish, smell was nothing noteworthy. Taste was typical of an American lager, this too, not noteworthy. Feel was fine, slight carbonation. Overall, got this because the bar had lesser choices, Bud Light and the like. Not downing this, if it’s the only option, go for it."
Traditional Lager,3.3,"A staple in early NY beer bars which was smart - one of the original cross-over beers for the fizzy yellow beer crowd.
The fact that it was ""local"" meaning close enough for NYers that they had some idea where PA was helped make it popular and that it was innocuous in terms of flavor didn't hurt, so the main reservation back then was "" it was a dark beer"". The horror!
Well, we have come a long way baby. And Yuengling continues to be both a staple every day beer for some and a ""corny"" cross-over beer for newbs.
Amber to reddish brown in color it pops a white head that falls quick and leaves little trace behind.
Aroma is corn flakes with a hint of honey - usually over carbonated so there is a gassy staleness on draft any way.
Flavor is mildly caramelly and faintly hoppy with a tiny bite of back end bitterness.
Finish is slightly sweet with a lingering soggy frosted flakes aftertaste.
It's East coast Fat Tire but been around a lot longer."
Traditional Lager,2.7,"Crystal clear. Minimal head with little lacing. With vigorous swirling the head livens up, fine bubble with a very creamy look. Still falls quickly.

Nose is estery, like fresh apples. Some roasty toast or mild biscuit, a bit of DMS. Pretty much the standard ""beer"" smell. Nothing offensive, nothing really nice.

Taste is a bit less pleasant. Mild and indistinct hoppiness. Esters are less apparent on the palate. Some oxidative quality, slightly stale and cardboardy. Some corny flavor, perhaps DMS. Moderate biscuity flavor in the mid palate, which is kind of nice. The finish is almost soapy, and a bit too sweet. Aftertaste is biscuit, floral (probably what I'm perceiving as soapy), and caramelly cardboard.

Mouthfeel is OK. Light and moderately refreshing, but a bit thin and watery. If the finish was dry, rather than cloying, then it would be much nicer.


It's mostly inoffensive. I'd probably rather have a Shiner or a Ziegenbock, if I'm going for this style of beer (and I can't say I ever am, outside of palate exploration). I wouldn't refuse one, at least."
Traditional Lager,3.87,"Because America! Fuck yeah!

If you get a tingle in your balls when the national anthem plays, get goosebumps when you see the flag, or still get an erection when a bald eagle flies over…this beer is for you.

It’s not a perfect lager, but my friends, neither are we as a country. However, this lager represents a melting pot of freedom. An opportunity, in-spite of humble beginnings, to make anything of yourself. It represents an idea. An idea that in this great country you are free to drink anything you can dream of or brew it.

Happy Fourth of July Gentlemen, and God Bless America!"
Traditional Lager,3.05,"Yuengling Traditional Lager bottle at refrigerator temperature. Yuengling Traditional Lager looks good, and is one of a bunch of middle-of-the-road east coast ambers including Brooklyn Lager, Blue Point Toasted Lager. Traditional Lager is OK, but lacking in malt body. To me it is similar to Dos Equis Amber in style and quality. It's good enough in a pinch."
Traditional Lager,3.19,"Highly preferred over the BMC ( and their light versions too.) . This beer has more malty flavor than other macro adjuncts and is very easy to drink. This beer is tasty and cheap enough to be a fridge filler , give to your visitors and not have to apologize for it. Most bars and restaurants have it too. Not much smell and a little thin, but it delivers some malty sweetness with only a hint of bitterness. A very solid beer."
Traditional Lager,3.86,"Very pleasant easy drinking ""red"" lager! An easy go to beer."
Traditional Lager,3.42,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Clear amber color with a foamy off-white head. Smells of sweet caramel malt and adjunct filler. Mildly sweet caramel malt carries through in the flavor but is accompanied by an unwelcome metallic aftertaste. Medium-light bodied. As far as mass-appeal beers go, you could do far worse."
Traditional Lager,3.87,"Maybe i am late to the party but this a solid beer the color is nice , smell is ok taste is good i think for my Oklahoma standards, just got to get it from Texas for it. Sure in the hell beats Budwieser at least for me. Drink local have fun ."
Traditional Lager,3.67,"While I enjoy expensive, unique beers as much as the next guy. I can’t lie when I say that when it’s super hot I go for a lager over a IPA/stout/etc. This beer is cheap, and it’s very very good for a lager. While it’s not the most amazing beer you can get, you can usually find a 6 pack for 10 or less and that’s commendable for how good this beer actually is

It tastes really subdued for a beer but not super subdued like Bud Light

Smell is alright, nothing special

Feel is nice, very refreshing

In a bottle it look ok, In a glass it’s a very nice color, almost no head though

One of my favorites"
Traditional Lager,3.35,Very malty and carmelly.
Traditional Lager,3.53,"A beer everyone can agree on. It's extremely affordable (2 for $4 tallboys) and is more than passable: it's simply good. Standard beer taste, a little malty and sweet. Not watery, not skunky. Nice body and enjoyable, refreshing taste."
Traditional Lager,3.92,This is a macro I truly enjoy drinking. I love its light malty sweetness and have always found it refreshing and very drinkable. I'll buy this any time I see it... which is very unoften due to distro area.
Traditional Lager,4.03,"Bright, clear pale amber with a thin ribbon of head that doesn’t hang around; caramel nose with some DMS and spicy hops; lagery grain with some toffee and spicy hop end; smooth, almost creamy, moderate carb.

3.75 3.75 4.25 4 4

Doesn’t look or smell impressive, but delivers a decent approximation of a historical US lager.
Yeah, there’s some corn, it’s too sweet, and it should be livelier, but there’s some deep malts, real lager leanness and more than enough hops to clean it up.
For a wide distro supermarket $7-a-six-pack lager, this has far more character than you’re paying for.

Often the best option in craft-unfriendly places, and that’s fine."
Traditional Lager,3.08,"picked up a 32 oz, usually fresher in my area, as with alot of these mass produced beers... the big boy bottles tend to be fresher. had this on draft, in a can, in a bottle, too many times. average fizzy beer no lacing no head retention. def think they use porterine to color this one.

Edit: This beer can shine if poured right. if you do that classic numbskull no head to the tippy top pour, this is one of the most carbonated wet stale cardboard beers youll ever neck down. If you exude some testicular fortitude and confidence, youll direct pour the sumbitch right into your oversized 500 ml pilsner urquell mug, gettin a nice big ol spongey white head with plenty of lace. So the 32 OZ brown quart glass bottles carry the unspoiled malt flavor much better. the green bottle 12 oz is just more aesthetically pleasing, but i drink through the eyes of a blind man. what would this review be without the home row keys and that little bump underneath the f and j? htrhetureturehtrehjkghadlkfghirt. This score will reflect a direct pour from 32 oz brown glass, since im not a bartender and cant be pissed to ask the tender to do let her rip, let it sit, and come back to it in a few minutes for that slow pour german style. then again the poor girl is also trying to swat the barflies and fruit flies that you will absolutely see in any bar serving this classic baby on draft."
Permanent Funeral,4.25,"From a 12oz bottle, aggressive pour yields a foggy amber color with a big frothy head that faded to a cap, leaving some nice lacing. Snot machine says pine, citrus and a caramel malt backbone, taste buds agree. ABV is very well hidden. No date on the bottle, but I'm guessing it's a bit old......"
Permanent Funeral,4.32,"This is a great Imperial IPA!!!! Such strong flavors and mouthfeel could easily be attributed an American Barleywine as well!!!! Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this beer featured a hazy but bright apricot color with a big foamy white head. Head retention was excellent and there were thick bands of foamy lacing on the glass. Aroma was strong and pleasant, mostly floral, aromatic hops and sweet caramel malt. Flavor was more of the same but with great bitterness and piney hops overtaking floral hops. Great balance between the rich sweet malt and the strong piney bitterness. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel was rich like an American Barleywine with both sweetness and bitterness featured. A great sipping beer!!! One of the best beers I have had in a long time!!!"
Permanent Funeral,4.25,"Hazy orange with a 2"" off white head, which lasts. Heavy lacing. Suspended particles.

Aroma of orange, pineapple, mango.

Taste is orange zest. pineapple, mango, caramel malt, pepper, pine, resin.

Medium body, light carbonation. Dry, resinous finish.

An outstanding IMP IPA."
Permanent Funeral,4.11,A malt monster. Lots of sediment in my can.
Permanent Funeral,4.04,"Can dated 10-04-2021

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.

Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.

Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good IIPA but too high in ABV for my personal tastes for an IPA/IIPA. I just find the malt sweetness a bit much in hop centric beers over 9.5% or so."
Permanent Funeral,3.46,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 10/04/21 Q0433""

Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.

Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.

Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.

Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability. I probably wouldn't drink it often but I wouldn't turn it down."
Permanent Funeral,4.62,"12 oz bottle, born on 10/13/21, poured into a Teku glass at 43 degrees F:

S: fresh hops with tropical fruits and citrus.

T: sweet up front with herbal and grassy hops. A nice bitterness surges up with fruit flavors.

M: medium in body with a moderate carbonation and a slick finish.

O: overall a pretty good brew. Hits hard, but didn't taste like it"
Permanent Funeral,4.4,"Picked this up at Hy-vee in Owatonna Minnesota. No canned on date.
Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness.

Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming.

Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms.

Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show. Also pretty expensive at $14 for a 4-pack of tall boys. I don’t think I would buy it again, but if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down and I’m glad I tried it."
Permanent Funeral,4.67,"Deep gold body with excellent clarity; tight white head; long cap retention ( heavy ring and heavy soapy lace that sheets the glass. Tropical fruit/citrus nose. Bitter lemon rind, pineapple, resinous pine; firm malt base. Smooth medium plus body; sticky resin feel; some warmth from 10.5% abv; moderate minus carbonation; boozy bite on tip of tongue. A monster DIPA; long bitter citrus linger; world class."
Permanent Funeral,4.56,"Can dated 10/5/21 into pint glass. Pours a hazy deep amber-gold with a persistent off-white head. Initial impression is pineapple, mango, pink grapefruit, and a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is medium and quite clean; alcohol is incredibly well hidden. Finish fades to a slightly resinous bitterness. Overall, this is a delicious DIPA that (despite what you might expect from the label) is quite restrained and very well-balanced. Excellent DIPA!"
Permanent Funeral,5,This beer is absolutely one of the best imperial ipas in the world. A grassy but very floral nose is complicated by a warm boozy start going into a happy bliss with a clean finish. A definite must try
Heavy Mettle,4.05,"Can from tfontana, thanks for the opportunity!
Hazy murky lemon orange color with a frothy white head that dissipates. Lemony grapefruity citrus with hints of mango and pineapple with a hint of pine and resin. Sweet bready malt underneath and a hint of warming alcohol. Far out and solid!"

Can, thanks to DC, to tulip glass.


LOOK: murky hazy yellow, beautiful cream colored head with excellent retention. Beautiful.
AROMA: grapefruit, vegetable, cantaloupe, pineapple. A little light.
TASTE: pine resin, general citrus tries to fend of the pine but can't quite do it. Some light touches of pepper, spice, melon. Pine dominates upfront and in the finish with a temporary splish of citrus in the middle.

FEEL: medium body, good carbonation, touch of astringency.


Well crafted, just too bitter for my tastes.

Heavy Mettle,4.46,Canned 08/24/2020. Enjoyed on 09/25/2020.
Heavy Mettle,4.46,"Pours a bright and hazy yellow. A finger of soapy white head. Solid retention, some lacing. A dense haze leading to minimal light penetration.

Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence.

Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence.

Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.

Overall an enjoyable NEIPA. This one is a big boy. Juicy, sweet, and dank. I personally preferred Cutting Tiles, but there is still many Trillium IPAs to try and I look forward to future entries into this brewery."

Heavy Mettle,4.79,Smells dank and melon like. Straw colored haze with big fluffy head that leaves some drapes on the way down. Sticky long finish with sweet melon and citrus to go with slight bitterness.
Heavy Mettle,4.68,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it."

Duck Duck Gooze,4.47,"Received from @dimidiata. Pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. Fully translucent, almost clear. Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer.

Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean.

Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer."
Duck Duck Gooze,4.57,"2022 vintage

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it

After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic

While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness

Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!"
Duck Duck Gooze,4.54,"the 2016 is on point right now. Very complex, sharp and interesting wine barrel aged sour. if you haven't had a chance it's very much worth seeking this beer out!"
Duck Duck Gooze,4.5,"Was so hyped for this beer, and it is good...but left feeling disappointed overall"
Duck Duck Gooze,4.6,"2016 Vintage

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.

Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.

Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.

Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.

Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning."

Duck Duck Gooze,4.75,"2016 release, enjoyed in 2020. Light orange-golden, unfiltered but pretty transparent and bubbly. No residual lacing. Bright and floral, quite tart on the first sip, but sweeter and fruitier after that. Apricot, peach, grapefruit, bits of cranberry and granny smith. Light straw and funk underneath the sourness."
Edmund Fitzgerald,3.68,"Pours nicely, decent head that stuck around a bit. Color is rather thin and see through. Smooth, easy to drink.

Good beer, adequate for the price and style, but nothing special."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.52,"A classic of the style. Roasty, with lots of coffee and dark chocolate notes. Hits the spots and then some. That's what makes it a classic of the style."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"A pretty solid example of a Porter, but there's something amiss that I can't pinpoint that without this would be top notch.
It may be a bit heavy on the black malt, too much hops?
Not sure.
Still, better than most out there.
I'll stick to my Yuengling Porter. Easier drinking."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"Look: It pours very dark brown with a tan head. Head retention is very good.

Smell: It has chocolate aromas with some roast and coffee notes.

Taste: It has roasted and coffee flavors up front with chocolate notes mixed it. There is a bit of sweetness to it.

Feel: It have a medium body with a bitter finish.

Overall, this is a simple beer with flavors, but they work incredibly well together."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.03,"Beautiful deep dark and clear brown, a dense light brown head that persists; great lacing.

Nose has subtle dark cherry note, some cocoa and weak coffee, woody smell.

Taste has the same dark fruit twang, bitter dark chocolate; nice roast and almost smokey note lingers in the after taste.

Medium body, soft smooth carbonation, nice roast driven bitterness, dry finish."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.17,"The most noticable thing about this to me is the complexity in the flavor. Immediately it gives a lot of coffee and roasted flavors, and it lasts with a strong lingering bitterness. In some ways it almost tastes more bitter than a lot of IPAs owing to the burnt character. Very tasty."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.75,"Might be some recency bias but this is easily the best porter I've had since Capella by Ecliptic, to name one. Super dark, basically opaque but not all the way, delicious robust malty flavor. This lived up to my expectation"
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.46,"Poured into glass from bottle.

L: Very dark, almost stout-colored, with smallish/moderate head.

S: Roasty, a little bit of coffee note.

T: Same as the nose, but with a little more sweetness in the mix. Fades to bitterness in the end.

F: Soft and smooth.

O: The standard against which I measure every other porter I drink. Classic."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.27,"The beer to give to a friend that only drinks Bud. Good beer, just doesn't pop like many of the newer beers."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.25,"Pours mahogany with a 1.5"" tan head, which lasts. Heavy lacing.

Aroma is coffee, roast malt, cocoa nibs.

Taste follows nose: Coffee, roast malt, cocoa.

Medium body, light carbonation. Dry finish.

This is a classic Porter. Good across the board."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.28,"Close to black with a dark brown head. Roasty aroma, and the taste is roasty malts for miles, a little touch of sourness on the top and a lasting bitterness on the back. Medium body, decently creamy mouthfeel. Very good for a porter you can find anywhere."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.37,From a bottle. Very dark brown with a half inch of light brown head. Roasted malt and vanilla smell. Full bodied. Roasted malt and coffee flavors with a little vanilla. Excellent
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.19,"From the bottle into an 8oz drinking glass. Look is stout-like, dark porter. Smell is mild, light coffee stout but with something benevolently evasive. Flan? Taste is sweeter than a pale ale but with some hoppy-happyness. Feel is very smooth, silky. Overall, takes a second glance - kind of eases into you like the shortish female with the good personailty, without big curves, not obnoxious but bright, who people are not paying all that much attention to and then later, away from the noise, you realize she is maybe the most attractive woman, with incredibly complimentary features, you have seen in months, if not years. Nice brew."
Edmund Fitzgerald,4.49,"12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.
L: Pours dark brown with light ruby edges. Has a frothy pock-marked robust 2.5"" tan head that has excellent retention. Abundant sticky lacing and banding. No visible carbonation.
S: Dark chocolate, caramel, heavily toasted malts, raisins, lightly floral.
T: Raisins, figs, dark soda bread, a fair amount of bitter dark chocolate, dark toasted malts, light char, light citrus zest at the top of the palate.
F: This superior tasting porter retains a brisk, fresh, soft medium bodied mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. It's right in the middle and has a beautiful texture that is luxurious. It is lightly drying.
O: Extremely well balanced and crafted, full flavored and facilitating with tangible earth flavors. This American Porter is agreeably world-class in it's style."
Sanctification,4.24,"375 ml bottle, corked and caged. Dated bottled ""010919"" so assuming January 2019

Pours a crystal clear light golden in color, the picture looks more hazy because it's humid and there was instant condensation. Bight pillowy head that condenses down to a thin cap, but great head retention, and leaves rings of lacing on the glass. Bright slightly tart lemon aroma, a touch of grassy funk. Taste starts with crackery pale malt, in the middle hits some floral and citrus notes, then finishes quite dry. Thinner bodied, effervescent lively carbonation. Overall very nice, seems deserving of it's #3 spot on the Top Rated list of Brett Beers."
Sanctification,4.11,"Pours clear with a lot of bubbles, a 2 finger head. Smells rich, like it’s aged in wine barrels. Tastes like Carbonated dry with a little bitterness. Dry feel, more dry than a Chardonnay."
Sanctification,4.32,"Serving: 375 ml bottle (“bottled on: 090721”) poured into a Spiegelau beer tulip.

Appearance: Slightly hazy straw yellow with a sudsy cap of white foam and faint lace.

Smell: Yeasty pizza dough, wet wool, citrus blossoms.

Taste: Crisp, light, dry and delicate with farmyard funk, minerals, spice and a light acidity.

Mouthfeel: Light body and gentle but lively carbonation.

Overall: Complex yet restrained, dry and refreshing with some nice nuance."
Sanctification,4.21,Bottled 9/7/21.
Sanctification,4.3,Bottled on 09/05/2017. Enjoyed on 11/06/221.
Sanctification,3.84,"Pours a clear golden straw color with a massive, airy, semi-rocky white head that’s fairly quick to dissipate and leaves soap bubble lacing.

Fairly dry, woody aroma with maybe an underlying hint of clove.

Super clean taste. A little wood, a little clay, very dry finish. Very, very faint hints fruitiness peak through at various points in the form lemon and grape, but overall, the taste exudes clarity and dryness.

Light bodied and bubbly, effervescent feel.

Well crafted, but a little too clean for my taste, especially when drank next to other Russian River offerings."
Sanctification,4.12,Poured from a bottle- almost clear pale gold straw color with long lasting white foamy head. Nose is funky with whiffs of fruit and wet hay. Taste follows with a funky briney tartness. Finishes almost dry.
Sanctification,4.71,"This beer was very enjoyable. Soft carbonation, nice amount of tartness with sweet to make it very well balanced. Very refreshing. If you ever see this on the shelves, grab one."
Sanctification,4.46,"L: Slightly hazy golden with a thin, wispy head and no lacing.

S: Classic barnyard funk (and I know now that I worked on a farm) with some pineapple, lemon and bready malt.

T: Very tart upfront, moves into funky pineapple, lemon flavors and a very nice round malt character. Excellent.

F: Very crisp and dry.

Overall: A superb ale, so drinkable and flavorful. This is definitely one of my favorite Russian River beers and I highly recommend you try it."
Sanctification,4.75,"Bottled 02/21/19, held up well without any spillage and full carbonation upon uncorking. This is a Brett bomb! Stellar aromas and flavors of funk, barn, hay, earth, bright fruit, meadow, all that good stuff you want in a wild yeast. Dry, almost tart finish, super drinkable, and a low ABV%, what’s not to love? It’s a masterpiece!"
Sanctification,3.5,.....
Sanctification,4.54,Lighter beer. Loved it.
Sanctification,4.5,"4/21/2019 - Golden color with nice carbonation. Dry, yet crisp semi tart feel on palate. Really good beer brewed in the wine country!"
Dale's Pale Ale,3.92,From a can dated 7/27/22. Clear amber color with a finger of beige head. Piney hop aroma. Medium body and a sticky feel. Solid malty flavor with some pine and earthy hops.
Dale's Pale Ale,4.4,"A go-to IPA. I once had a friend tell me this brew was ""too dry."" He actually gave me 5 of a 6-pack back. I enjoyed that which he refused. This isn't a complex IPA, but if you are somewhere where choice is limited, here's a choice."
Dale's Pale Ale,4,Pours a cloudy amber. Thick foam. Nutty aroma. Bready malt body. Medium hop bitterness. Slight sweet finish. Pretty good flavor. Would be a great fall beer.
Dale's Pale Ale,3.88,"Purchased as a single 12oz can from Harris Teeter for $1.70. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear copper, with a one-finger pale white head. Pretty good lacing.
S - Earth. Sweet pine. Grapefruit peel.
T - Earth & pine-forward, but not overbearing. Well-balanced, but noticeably hoppy. Grapeseed oil. Woodsy. Oat.
F - Medium-bodied, with mild carbonation. Silky, and smooth. Refreshing, yet filling.
O - A solid pale ale. Not too hoppy, and well-balanced. A fantastic afternoon ale."
Dale's Pale Ale,4.17,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 5/26/22, into my spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a fluffy 2 finger head forms woth a good amount of fine carbonation rising from a light amber body with no haze. Very nice head retention on this one with just a half finger of head loss over the 5 minutes since I've poured. Head does become rocky but sticks around very nicely.

Aroma is more balanced than I remember with less hops jumping out at me than expected. The hops are surprisingly fruity with some tropical bright notes balanced by a nice sweet bready maltiness. Some slight fermentation sweetness is present on the nose but it's still quite a clean fermentation. Good but lighter aroma than expected.

Flavor carries some similar notes to the aroma, but loses a lot of the tropical vibes for a more traditional bittering hop flavor but there is a floral sweetness that merges very nicely with the very nice malty sweetness that this beer brings. The bitterness in this one comes after a the sweet hit on the front subsides but it remains a very balanced and quite sweet beer with some nice and present bitterness on the back.

The feel is easy drinking and refreshing while still letting you know it's there big body from the head retention and the malts even have a bready soft mouthfeel it seems. It's very balanced in this aspect as well.

Overall this beer honestly surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. The malty notes stood out while still maintaining a nice balanced hop presence. Quite a sweet beer which was honestly a bit of a surprise considering how similar this beer was to other IPAs it felt while drinking it in the past, but this is honestly an easy drinking beer that brings big but balanced flavor that I personally quite enjoy."
Dale's Pale Ale,3.77,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can I to a standard pint glass. Huge frothy “coke float” head on aggressive pour. Golden/light-amber clear color. Head dissipates slowly. Lacing is decent and a 1/4th finger head stays through half the drink before finishing with a film of bubbles.

S - Sweet malty scents. Some citrus scents as well. Light pine hops.

T - taste is more along the citrus and pine note. Slightly floral as well. Medium bitterness from the hops. Taste smooths out as you drink it and the malt characteristics return. It’s nice that some tastes are more hoppy while others are more malty.

F - Good frothy mouthfeel with decent carbonation.

O - This is a very solid everyday drinking beer. I’m not a hophead and prefer more malt-forward beers, so this carries a little more bitterness than I like, but it’s still a really good beer. The fact that the tastes go back and forth between malt and hop is an enjoyable experience. Would recommend."
Dale's Pale Ale,4.34,"This is a 12oz. can dumped into the Oskar Blues pint glass. This ale is a beautiful amber, very clear, with light but steady carbonation. one finger of white foam that hung around a lengthy time leaving thick lacing behind.
The aroma is maty from a distance, very noticeable, with the nose at the glass I get the pine aromas. Exactly what I hope for from a pale ale.
This ale is very pleasant, caramel, pine, and citrus. Sweet up front with a tangy, crisp finish.
The feel is smooth, light, and a bit fizzy.
This is an easy one to sample, but at 6.5% ABV it may sneak up on you after a few."
Dale's Pale Ale,3.47,"5/21/22 The Wine Shop, 4000 Emerson Ave., Parkersburg WV"
Dale's Pale Ale,4.44,"12oz can traded across the Pacific Ocean. Considering its journey, it's held up really well.

It's a burnished copper beer sitting in the glass with a thick, bright head that lingers throughout the glass.

Aroma is malty with strong, dank, piney hops. Very enticing!

Flavour is strongly bitter and caramel malty, with a citrus and piney hop body shining through. Finishes sweet, tangy and a little dry.

Mouthfeel is well carbonated and the tongue knows it's there, even after the swallow as the carbonic prickle lingers well after the swallow.

This is a great beer. I can imagine it would be awesome fresh at the source.

Cheers!"
Dale's Pale Ale,3.52,"A golden pale ale with a decent head. An aroma of citrusy bread with a flat bread taste, nothing too distinguishable. It is a fine beer, nothing special, nothing that truly makes it stand out."
Dale's Pale Ale,4.19,"19.2 oz. can poured into pilsners glass, $2.09 from HEB
Look: Cloudy amber, 2-finger off-white head, good carbonations, nice lacing
Smell: Fruity and floral, grapefruit, a little malt on the finish, pleasant
Taste: Medium bitterness, grapefruit comes through, especially in the finish, taste lingers after swallowing
Feel: Decent mouthfeel, not too heavy and a good amount of carbonation, coats the mouth well
Overall: This is true to its style. Maybe a bit bitter for chugging on a hot day, but for sipping or mixing with foods that play off its fruitiness it would be ideal.
Pair with spicy foods, hard-wood grilled foods, BBQ sauce and aromatic cheeses like Stilton."
Dale's Pale Ale,3.84,19.2 oz can. Pours rich amber with a nice off white head and lots of small bubbles. On the nose you get the hops more than malt. The malt is hidden by the pale ale for the IPA crowd. You get pine and grapefruit in the hops. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. This is a good transition beer. Try it.
Dale's Pale Ale,4.25,"The iconic Dale's and its ugly ass can....an American classic Pale Ale now, and still a big one to get a good buzz. Not my favorite pale ale, but it is a good one, more like an old school ipa in some ways. Pretty good, but not the best. A good hot dog/ ballgame type of beer. bold malt and hop and stands the test of time"
Dale's Pale Ale,4.64,"I had never tried Dale's Pale Ale until I moved to North Carolina only 14 miles from the Brevard brewery. I've seen it before, but the plain label made me think it was a generic pale ale. Boy, was I wrong. It's a 'hoppier' pale ale than I'm used to and, for me, is perfect as an everyday-anytime alternative to the heavier IPAs that I still love.

It's crisper than an average IPA and lighter."
Dale's Pale Ale,4.09,"So this was the last one of the IPA 16oz i tried from the local beer distributor. Why? Because of the plain label. I thought if they didn't put much time into the label, how good could it be. Well, it is actually better than alot of the others i tried. A little darker than the others, it is clean and crisp with a medium hop taste. Don't be fooled by the label like i was, worth trying."
Dale's Pale Ale,3.94,"Probably one of the more recognized names in the pale ale portfolio. Fairly priced and widely distributed so you're bound to run into it sooner or later. Not much to dislike since it is so well balanced, particularly in the taste. while some of those flavors stay distinct and identifiable. Reliable and satisfying."
Dale's Pale Ale,3.57,"Canned 9/1. Consumed 11/6
L: Clear copper, frothy white head
S: Hoppy with some sweet malt
T: Hope bite, caramel malt, balanced
F: Medium bodied, smooth mouthfeel, dry finish
O: Pretty good beer. I think I’d enjoy this one more with a meal as it seems like it would pair well with a lot."
Dale's Pale Ale,4.06,"12oz can.
L: Beautiful red/amber colour with a light haze and a thin and short-lived head.
S: Light and sweet.
T: Huge malt and hop profile - burnt toffee, nutmeg, light citrus and resin. Bone dry.
F: Medium/full bodied with a slick mouthfeel and an astringent finish.
O: Old skool AIPA. Rich malt sweetness married to an intense hop burn. Can remember first drinking a can of Dale’s when skiing in CO back in maybe 2010. It looks the same now (same packaging) and I reckon it tastes pretty much the same as well. Good stuff. An American craft ale OG."
Pranqster,4.15,"Bottle
L-indeed golden. Cloudy. Minimal head fades rapidly
S-funky with Belgian esters, mineral tones predominating. Less fruit than typical for style
T-surprisingly well balanced given the nose. There is an undertone of yeast and bread, and a flavor led by clean minerals and fruit (banana?) flavors are now present (unlike the nose)
F-smooth, medium bodied, with a little stickiness
O-a successful American beer that gives a successful homage without being a copy."
Pranqster,4.14,"Poured into a pint glass: color is straw gold, slight haze, head pours 1/2 finger thick and dissipates quickly to nothing except thin ring along the glass side, limited lacing on glass sides.

Smell is Belgian esters, lighter phenols, bubble gum, toast, bread, yeast byproduct, honey and fruitiness from yeast.

Taste is similar with esters, light phenols, Belgian yeast byproducts, bread, candi sugar and some honey, stone fruit, straw, bread/wheat.

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness, drying from the fermentation/finished gravity, then some lingering sweetness.

Overall a very pleasant, sweeter Belgian golden ale - yeast and esters are subtle but enticing, sweetness counters dryness, but still overall an interesting ale."
Pranqster,3.75,"A decent (strong) Belgian pale, but I found it lacking in any particular (single) strength. Nothing was off but nothing stood out.

Slight taste of rock sugar also threw me off."
Pranqster,4,"2022-02-02
12oz bottle served in a snulip. Don't see a date on it. Left about a half inch in the bottle so there's not much sediment in the beverage I'm reviewing. I've had this many times, but not for many years.

Pours a clear deep golden with a smallish head. Collapses into a frothy ring and dusty wisps streaking across the surface. Not much active carbonation. Smell is light banana / yeasty esters, something else in there that I can't put my finger on. Fruity. Maybe pear.

Taste is following along pretty closely, but there's an oaky astringency and a woody bitterness, too, making it much less one-note.

Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, this is a nice beer. As good as I remember it being."

pretty good a bit sweet and soft."
Pranqster,3.62,"Look: Pale amber liquid with a white head. I was expecting a more robust color for a strong ale.
Smell and Taste: Resembles mor of a citrusy IPA to me.
Feel: Dry, crisp and quite refreshing.
Overall: I like many strong ales however, this ones not for me."
Pranqster,4.13,"Orange amber color with a thin off white head. Aroma of fruity esters, banana, clove, and apple cider. Taste is fruity, orange zest and apple cider with a hint of honey sweetness from the malts. Well balanced and goes down clean. Finish is slightly warming with just a mild sour quality. Feel is just slightly oily. Excellent ale."
Pranqster,4.18,"Minimal head, lovey hazy orange body. Bread, banana, light esters, and light pine aromas. Taste follows suit, with bready malt, mild piney hops that produce a well balanced bitterness, becoming sweet banana and fruit esters, finishing with orange peel and hints of clove. Feel is wet and creamy, and the alcohol is present throughout the sip (though not strongly so).
Fruit, spices, and cream. Nuff said."
Pranqster,4.6,A very good well made American example of the style.
Pranqster,4.5,"A really well done Belgian Ale. Yeasty and sweet, grassy, earthy but enough hops to balance it out. I've been in craft beer sampling for over 10 years now and I can't believe this North Coast beer has missed my radar all this time. I'll really enjoyed it and recommend."
Pranqster,4.28,"L - Golden with a good amount of clarity and a small white head that dissipates quickly leaving behind minimal lacing
S - Tons of Belgian yeast and fruity esters, sugar, and spices
T - Follows the nose with Belgian yeast intermixed with fruity esters (light fruits such as apples and pears) throughout along with candi sugar as light spices
F - Light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation
O - A solid Belgian ale, but nothing spectacular"
Pranqster,3.99,"12 ounce bottle into a tulip snifter. Had 2/1/21.

Pours a bright yellow, pretty clear, with a half inch foamy head and light, foamy lacing. Aromas of Belgian yeast, malt, candi sugar, some wheat, light spices, light funk as it warms. Flavors of malt, candi sugar, wheat, light spices, light Belgian yeast. Smooth, a very good lighter body, well carbonated.

Maybe not top tier for the style, but well made and enjoyable. A fairly classic interpretation of the style that’s worth a purchase at a great price point."
Pranqster,4.25,"It smells sweet like apples, pears and yeasty bread water. Maybe even a little grapy.

It's as sweet as it smells with the funky yeasts of a Belgian ale.  It's got the taste of wine.

The mouthfeel is thin and really bubbly with carbonation.  The finish is long, clean and fruity with a little bite of bitterness.

Overall it's a very drinkable Belgian ale. I give it a 5.1 out of 6."
Pranqster,3.79,"12 oz bottle brought from room temp shelf, chilled, then poured into a goblet. Orange, slightly hazy, with 1+ finger of dense white foam. Smell is spicy, malty, bready but somewhat subdued. Same with taste. Pleasant, light carbonation in mouthfeel. Overall not bad but just not as in-your-face Belgian impressive as I had hoped for."
Pranqster,3.73,"Pours a hazy yellow/light orange in color with a bitchin white head that rises in the glass. Smells of sweet-grains, clove, spices, yeast. Taste very much follows the nose, fruity & somewhat spicy. Medium-bodied, high carbonation, crisp finish, warming. Not typically a fan of Belgian style, but i found this one enjoyable."
Pranqster,4.56,There isn't much to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. It's good! The dangerous part about it is that it is way too smooth for the ABV. you could definitely be on your behind if you're not careful.
Pranqster,3.92,"Translucent beer with an unfiltered look. Light head without much lacing. Smell nicely previews the yeastiness that comes about in the front and back of the beer. Taste is smooth and interesting, as the full malty flavor of the ale comes in the front and stays in the back of the mouth throughout. It's a bit overcarbonated for my taste, but that might be a function of me being less familiar with Belgian style ales. Overall a decent beer you should pick up if it's in front of you."
Pranqster,4.07,"Not sure how I don't have a review for this
Pours a light fizzy head with lower retention, low lacing, hazy med golden pale color with sediment

Nose sweet Belgian blonde malt, grainy sweet, straw, lots of fruit, apple, pear, apricot, a little oxidized aged malt

Taste brings sweet malt, grainy, straw, Belgian golden malt and little candy like, more fruity esters, pome fruit, dried apricot, touch of spice, lighter herbal bitterness, little waxy aged sight oxidized malt, drier finish, quite fruity

Mouth is med bod, med higher frothy carb

Overall solid Belgian golden, I think this has some age to it, bit still good"
Pranqster,4.02,"12oz bottle coded 01151124 (almost a year old & unrefridgerated until yesterday) poured into a tulip glass at just above fridge 7.6% ABV. The beer pours hefe-hazy in light orange & yellow color with off white head. The head maintains at a steady quarter inch fed by a ton of bubbles from the bottom of this North Coast tulip. The aroma is soft pale malt accented by fruity and floral notes. The taste is semisweet malt and candi sugar with hints of banana, clove, pear and white pepper. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, good."
Pranqster,4.21,"Separating a 4-pack of 12oz bottles. North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin is one of my all time favorite beers. I am excited to mull this over.
Pours a vibrant copper-orange, SRM 8. with an active, mousse-like off-white head, thin. Bubbles are small and fast to rise. There is a bit of cloudiness, but it is still clear. On the nose I get ripened banana and honey grain. Coriander with clove? A blanketing bouquet of flowers. All the notes are rather humble but synergize complexly. It tastes zingy upfront, but very rapidly mellows into sweeter baked goods. Banana again. It almost tastes like a shocktop with added dimension. I swear there are micronotes of coriander and orange peel. Hop bitterness (Saaz) short-lived next to the slurry of malt and corn. It has a body to it, and medium-high carbonation. Oily yet soft.
I am thoroughly impressed with this Belgian Golden Ale. All reminiscent of Belgian styles, softer, sweet bread, subtle ester combinations. It is fruitier, with less caramel, compared to say, a tripel. And not as hefty. Let us not be deceived by the 7.6ABV, I wouldn't have guessed blindfolded, it is much smoother. A yeasty, golden bouquet to satisfy any palate."
Pranqster,4.14,"Banana, spice, crisp fruits. Pretty much just a boozier, funkier blue moon with an incredibly silky texture. What more can you ask of a strong Belgian?"
Pranqster,4.11,"pours a hazy pale red-tinged orange body with a small white foamed head that has low retention and leaves only occasional splatters of lacings as it settles to a thin cap with a defined halo

aroma is a floral lush citrus with lowkey Belgian spices (clove, caramelized banana) and obvious nod to Belgian yeast of the barnyard variety

as far as taste goes, the bright, floral and lush citrus form the majority while leaving room for the Belgian yeast, and having a background spice spread that is enhanced by a low grade caramel sweetness. an earthy dose of hop hangs around as well, providing a rounded out bitterness to balance the sweetness of the the citrus.

feel if high carbonation, medium-light body. runs smooth throughout and finishes slightly earthy bitter

overall:
fruit forward with a rustic barnyard Belgian yeast funk and spices coming last along with earthy hop.
it's an agreeable but somewhat funky sipper that keeps the hallmarks of the style but is far closer to a fantastic tribute than being the real deal. that's not necessarily bad, however. just is what it is. I enjoyed it tremendously."
60 Minute IPA,3.88,"They took an extra 30 minutes to make a much better beer called 90 minute IPA. Or so the joke goes. 60 minute is ok, but honestly pretty mediocre."
60 Minute IPA,4.33,"Another IPA that I will be adding to my IPA list. Reminds me of the SN ""Big Little Thing IPA"" but I can get the Dogfish Head beers here that are fresher, always fresher."
60 Minute IPA,4.7,"Could drink it all day. The feel is perfect. Reminds me of cream soda. The finish is where most IPA's and I part like the Red Sea, but I really like the clean, crisp finish. The opposite of Stone IPA in every way. Both are well-made, high quality beers but I much prefer Dogfish 60."
60 Minute IPA,3.55,Good tasting ipa. Not overly dry hopped so nice balance.
60 Minute IPA,4.76,"This is a fairly nicely balanced sessionable IPA that leans a tiny bit more on the hop forward/herbal side of the house, but not nearly even close to something like Stone IPA’s level of super strong somewhat unbalanced hop character. This is more comparable to Lagunitas IPA balance wise, but I still prefer Lagunitas IPA over this. Not a bad IPA."
60 Minute IPA,2.46,This is a watered down version of what it used to be several years ago. Dogfish Head’s beers are of a high quality but this is disappointing!
60 Minute IPA,4.18,A solid IPA
60 Minute IPA,3.95,"Can into pint glass.

L: Slightly cloudy, topaz-orange, with a thick head that laces very nicely.
S: Nice mix of grapefruit and resinous notes.
T: Tons of pine, a little citrus pith on the back, lingering bitterness.
F: I think it's really smooth, with a little carbonation on the finish.
O: Definitely a classic, though it's a little too forward to be a session IPA for me, and that's the niche I really want it to fill. Would grab it on tap if I saw it, though."
60 Minute IPA,4,"Crystal clear orange pour, soapy white head leaves a nicely laced glass. Snot locker get some grapefruit and a piney aroma. A good solid, old style IPA, been a long time since I've had one of these."
60 Minute IPA,4.02,"Cloudy orange tint on pour with fluffy head and lace curtains forming. Aroma is hoppy, piney and dank. Floral start, citrus middle with a finishing piney bite. A little too bitter for my tastes, but a finely constructed brew. Prefer the smoother finishing 90."
60 Minute IPA,4.34,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IPA Glass. One finger white head. Light orange color. Hazy. Lots of lacing. Fades to thin head.

S - Floral and citrus. Bitter. Expected IPA scents.

T - Wow. The bitterness, floral, and citrus all blend down to a great mix. Holy moly this is smooth and easy to drink!

F - Just great. Light carbonation. Medium consistency

O - This is a world class IPA that sets the standard for me. The favor is so balanced. Other IPAs hit with too much of the bitter flavors that it's overpowering. This is is the IPA that I will compare future IPAs to. I definitely recommend it and will put it in my regular rotation."
60 Minute IPA,4.3,Great IPA. Surprised me a little bit. My new go-to Standard IPA.
60 Minute IPA,4.25,"Date on can: March, 2022

Pours a translucent, copper in color which turns gold when you hold it up to a light. A half inch of frothy foam sits on top that dissipates to a thin layer over time. Lots of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Smells chewy. Candied malts with a soapy, evergreen pine and citrus hoppiness. Taste is similar to the aroma. Lots of piney hops, a little bit of lemon/citrus and a lovely, sweet, bready maltiness in the background. Finishes bitter and a tad dry with lingering lemon and citrus rind on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and a touch of chewiness.

This is a superbly crafted brew, at one time probably one of the best IPAs in the U.S. It remains a very solid offering with a great amount of flavor and complexity, if a bit ""old school"" tasting. A great example of a hop-forward beer that isn't overly hopped. It is balanced quite nicely with a low-key malt profile that adds ample body and just enough counteraction to the bitterness. I'm surprised I never reviewed this, as I had originally tried this well over a decade ago. It's interesting to revisit it after all this time. Cheers!"
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.23,"A: pours orange amber body with small white head with ok retention and lacing.
S: slight malty and earthy hopness.
T: earthy, hop notes with a balanced, sweet biscuity taste; slight vanilla aftertaste.
M: medium bodied and slightly crisp and refreshing.
O: nice feel and taste combo; pretty good overall.."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,"It is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.76,"Look... brown, brown, brown, copper and with ample carbonation and a white head. transparent
Smell...nonexistent light hop citrus with some maltiness
Taste...Resinous , slick, peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop. Good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color.
Feel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing
Overall...This is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from Celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes.
Its good why not try it!!!"
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.25,I had this many years ago. I remember it being excellent. A great balance of hops and malt. One of the most well balanced IPAs I've had.
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.75,"355 ml bottle, vintage 2015, in Nevada City. Amber to copper colour, large white head. Pleasant aroma of fresh hops, herbal and fruity notes. The flavour is also well hopped throughout, but the bitterness is not extreme for an IPA. A very decent and enjoyable beer."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.19,"Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. At this price, it would be hard to pass if I was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave"
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,3.99,"This one smells extremely bright and hoppy. It has no trace of malts in the smell.

The taste starts out with a citrussy and dank hoppiness.  Soon after it all turns very beery with a ton of sweet malts balancing everything out.

It feels foamy and smooth in my mouth. It leaves behind a lush and bitter aftertaste.

Overall it's a really good IPA.  It's got a similar taste to other Sierra Nevada IPAs but there's something more full about it. I give it a 4.7 out of 6."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.39,"12oz bottled 9-15-20. Opened 11-14-20.
2 finger dense, off-white head. Excellent retention.
Deep amber-gold color IPA. Bright, with a bit of initial chill haze.
Big nose of pine resin, grapefruit, caramel, lemon, and a leafy/spicy hop character. Sticky.
Cigar, pine, some citrus, earthy flavors.
The hop characters are dominated by earth and less by fruit and it works very well here.
Medium body, low-medium carbonation. Slick mouthfeel. Lengthy hop-fueled bitter finish.
Delicious, I really appreciate the leafy/earthy aspect of this beer.
Very unique in relation to the IPA category readily available today.
Outstanding."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.74,"I am not the biggest fan of this brewery. That being said, this beer is really good."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.43,"Look: Semi-clear dark reddish amber with a huge off-white head that billows and holds at two fingers, slowly receding and leaving sticky lacing behind
Aroma: Cut grass, rose petals, grapefruit-led citrus notes, floral hops, and bready, rich malt
Taste: Grassiness, a huge flower bouquet, and sharp citrus come crashing in on the palate followed by rose and an awesome, doughy (almost sourdough), bready malt base that tries to keep the hops tethered. Good clean hop bite on the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied but not chewy at all and lighter than both the look and taste would lead me to believe, medium-high carbonation, clean, and mild dryness on the finish
Overall: This is delicious. As both a Sierra Nevada and fresh hop fan, this is an easy one to get behind but it is really tasty and obviously well-made. The wet Centennial hops are very prominent in the taste and aroma (flowers, citrus, grass, and rose) but this beer’s delicious malt base is equally tasty and apparent, even in a beer meant to showcase hops. Reminds me of a fresh hop Celebration Ale but I can tell it’s a fresh hop plus the malt profile is not only different tasting but lighter than Celebration. Outstanding and recommended"
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.3,"Look is dark orange/red with a good size head of foam. Smell is grass earthy hop, slight pine and citrus. Taste is hop, bread crust, slight fruit rind bitterness on the finish. Overall an excellent beer, doesn’t try to push the envelope and stands out for what it is- a 6.7% IPA that leaves you with an enjoyable beer without an overly bitter palette explosion."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.27,"-optically clear golden-amber bottle pour with a 1 cm foam cap and a fresh, yet earthy hop aroma.
The flavor is full with balanced malt and hop elements. The hop influence is not sharp, but is very full. It has SN Celebration aspects and is very much appreciated."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.34,"SN never disappoints. This is one of their best.
a) Copper dark body sporting dense head with huge lacing splash. Extra points for color hue.
s) Features a fresh sawn wood, cedar, pine, sharp, spicy, and citrus.
t) Follow, with more wood shop, toast, rose, orange rind, delicate wood sap sweetness. Layered complexity.
f) Resiny, grassy, Yes clean and sharply bright.
o) Sum is greater than the parts too ."
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.77,"De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En almuerzo, cumple de asun hija (9 años) Con bacalao dorado de calamocha + filetes de pollo. Version de 2019. Sobresaliente aun con unos meses encima. Herbal, resinosa y acaramelada, de una manera suave pero asertiva. Deja con ganas de mas"
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,4.1,"Clear amber gold color with good white cap and lacing.

Aroma of solid, clean malt with enticing hop high notes of sweet citrus and pine.

Taste of fresh bread and caramel malt with a solid hop punch. Malt has good and flavorful depth with remarkable staying power and hop influence is equally present with further notes of grapefruit, lemon zest and an herbal essence that just underscores hop richness. Good flavors with great complexity and balance.

Full texture with balancing carbonation.

Overall it's a first rate expression."
